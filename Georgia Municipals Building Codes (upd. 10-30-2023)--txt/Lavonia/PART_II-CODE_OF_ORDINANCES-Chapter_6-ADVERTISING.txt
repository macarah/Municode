Secs. 6-2—6-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - SIGNS

Sec. 6-31. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The mayor and council are enacting this article to ensure that noncommercial messages are authorized with restriction only as to the size of such signage and to establish reasonable regulations for signage containing commercial messages. The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
By enacting this article, the mayor and council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Maintain the historical image of the city;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Promote economic development; and
(8)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
