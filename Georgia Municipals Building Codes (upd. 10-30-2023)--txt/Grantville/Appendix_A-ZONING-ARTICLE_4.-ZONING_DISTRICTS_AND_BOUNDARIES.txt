[Sec.] 4.1. - Establishment of Districts.
In order to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance, the City of Grantville is hereby divided into the following districts:
EXPAND
RD Rural Development District
R20 Single-Family Residential
R6 Multi-Family Residential
CR Commercial Residential
GC General Commercial
GI General Industry
OI (Office & Institutional)
PR (Parks & Recreation)
LM (Light Industrial)
Highway 29 Overlay District
NUP Neighborhood Unit Plan
  4.1-1
Rural Development District (RD). This district is intended to permit a combination of low-density residential uses of various types, limited agricultural activities and associated uses. The regulations of the district are designed primarily to encourage a compatible relationship between agriculture and low-density, single-family rural residential development.
4.1-2
Single-Family Residential (R20). The purpose of this district is to accommodate medium-density single-family residences. Single family dwellings are restricted to meeting Type I Appearance Standards.
4.1-3
Neighborhood Unit Plan (NUP). The NUP district is intended to provide land areas devoted to low- to medium-density single-family residential uses of three (3) or fewer units per acre consistent with the densities ranges suggested by the City Council. The NUP district is intended to: 1) encourage the development of medium sized tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or the development of vacant parcels of land with transitional densities in built-up areas; 2) encourage the preservation of trees and vegetation; and to 3) encourage innovative site planning.
4.1-4
Multi-Family Residential (R6). The purpose of this district is to accommodate higher density multi-family residential. Because of higher density, areas to be developed for this district would need a street system which will accommodate higher traffic volumes and are limited to the areas of the City served by sewer.
4.1-5
Commercial Residential (CR). This district is designed to provide a high quality environment for limited retail activities, offices for professional services and residential uses as part of the commercial structures.
4.1-6
General Commercial (GC). The purpose of this district is provide appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial activities which will serve a large market area. This district will generally be located along the major arterial highways or where these highways meet. Emphasis is on creating commercial nodes rather than strip developments.
4.1-7
General Industrial District (GI). The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for warehousing, distribution, manufacturing and other intensive activities of an industrial nature.
4.1-8
Office Institutional (OI). This district is for offices, institutions and limited commercial activities not involving the sale, storage or processing of merchandise unless otherwise permitted.
4.1-9
Parks and Recreation (PR). This district is designed to be a public park and open space district. Such parks and open space may be owned and/or operated by the City or the County and intended for public use. All improvements within these districts must be consistent with the approved park master plan (when it occurs) for the site of the City Comprehensive Plan. Land set aside as open space and placed under a conservation easement may also be classified in this district. Conditional Uses: Library, meeting hall, athletic facilities, museum and public non-commercial picnic areas and campgrounds.
4.1-10
Light Industrial (LM). This district is established to provide for manufacturing and related activities having a minimal impact on the environment and surrounding land uses. The district is intended to attract a complementary mix of assembly, fabricating, distribution, warehousing, and service firms. A goal of the light industrial district is to provide architectural and site design standards which encourage development of such uses in a park setting, yielding benefits to business operators, employees and the community. Several factors distinguish the LM, light industrial district from the (GI), General Industrial district. A restrictive range of uses, architectural and site design standards, and generally smaller building sizes and lower lot coverage ratios in the LM are examples of these factors.
4.1-10.1
Purpose. The LM, light industrial district is established to provide for manufacturing and related activities having a minimal impact on the environment and surrounding land uses. The district is intended to attract a complementary mix of assembly, fabricating, distribution, warehousing, and service firms. A goal of the light industrial district is to provide architectural and site design standards which encourage development of such uses in a park setting, yielding benefits to business operators, employees and the community. Several factors distinguish the LM, light industrial district from the (GI), General Industrial district. A restrictive range of uses, architectural and site design standards, and generally smaller building sizes and lower lot coverage ratios in the LM are examples of these factors.

Highway 29 Overlay District.
4.1-11.1
Purpose.
1.
Highway 29, which serves as the gateway to Grantville as well as Coweta County, is on the threshold of a tremendous boom in residential, commercial, and industrial growth. Development of well over 1,000 acres of raw land is being driven by proximity to Atlanta and Hartsfield International Airport, as well as access to the interstate system.
2.
The regulations set forth in this Section 4.1-11 are intended to insure attractive developments which are complimentary and will promote a mix of uses rather than the undesirable commercial sprawl which has plagued many communities, such as Union City and the Georgia Highway 138 corridor. These standards will reinforce and implement a land use plan that features residential, office, personal services, hospitality uses, and retail uses along Highway 29.
3.
To this end, it is the City's dual goal to protect the aesthetics of the community and to encourage both commercial and residential development along the Highway 29 corridor.
4.1-11.2
Overlay District. This district is intended as an overlay district regulating and allowing the establishment of uses within the configuration of the allowable "Highway 29 Overlay District" boundaries. Said boundary shall include any properties or portions thereof, located within Five Hundred (500) feet of the Highway 29 right-of-way, as it presently exists or may exist in the future. The underlying district shall continue as permitted uses. Standards set out in this Section for Site Development and Architectural Design shall control over any underlying district regulations.
4.1-11.3
