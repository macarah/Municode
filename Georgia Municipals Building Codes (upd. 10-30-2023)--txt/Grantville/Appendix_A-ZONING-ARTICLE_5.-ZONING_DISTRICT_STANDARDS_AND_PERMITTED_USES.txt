SIC Codes are used to refer to SIC Classifications. Entries with 0000 in the Reference SIC column do not correspond to any classification in the SIC Manual.
b.
When a use is not listed in the Permitted Use Schedule, the Zoning Administrator or Code Enforcement Officer shall classify it with that use in the table most similar to it. The SIC Manual shall serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted use. If the Zoning Administrator or Code Enforcement Officer should determine that a use is not listed and is not similar to a use in the Permitted Use Schedule, then said use is prohibited.
c.
Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in the same districts as are sales of that commodity, unless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use Schedule.
d.
If an industrial plant or facility involves two (2) (or more) manufacturing activities with different SIC codes on the same zone lot, the industrial plant shall be permitted only in those zoning districts where the more restricted activity is permitted. (For example, an industrial plant preparing canned peanuts and also manufacturing the cans is allowed in those zoning districts permitting can manufacturing.)
5.3-3 Mixed Uses. Two (2) or more permitted uses may occupy the same principal building.
5.3-4 Prohibited Uses. Within certain overlay districts, some uses may be prohibited or additional requirements apply, regardless of the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district(s). The following Overlay Districts impose additional requirements to underlying zoning districts:
