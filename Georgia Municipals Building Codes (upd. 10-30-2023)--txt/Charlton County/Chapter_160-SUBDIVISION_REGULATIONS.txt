Every development shall provide a stormwater management plan and hydraulic/hydrology calculations which are used to size pipes, ditches, flumes and all other stormwater conveyance structures/features. All hydrology and hydraulic computations shall be prepared, stamped and signed by a professional engineer currently registered in the state. The plan must ensure that adequate facilities are provided. The design must consider that the upstream drainage basin be fully developed in accordance with the county's current land use plan for all outfall ditches, canals and pipes which traverse through the development. The design of the stormwater system must take into consideration the affect of the runoff on downstream property and drainage ways. The hydrology analysis shall produce both pre-development and post-development runoff quantities and peak flows. The platting and layout of storm drainage pipes and culverts shall be prepared by a land surveyor or registered engineer and shall be submitted for approval by the county engineer.
(2)
Stormwater retention facilities shall be required where adverse stormwater runoff related impact is expected to result from the development. In addition to the stormwater analysis conclusions, the subdivision's location within the drainage basin and the knowledge of existing or anticipated problems by the county engineer shall be factored into the necessity of a detention facility. The retention pond design shall take into account groundwater table elevations when computing storage volumes. In lieu of construction of a detention facility, the developer has the option of upgrading downstream stormwater infrastructures (pipes, etc.) to eliminate the adverse impacts.
(3)
The stormwater plan shall include a drainage area map, which delineates all subareas within the subdivision, as well as any off-site subareas which impact any drainage facility within the subdivision. A condition of final plat approval shall be that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the detention pond has been built according to approved plans and specifications.
(4)

As required by the national fire prevention code and as adopted by the county board of commissioners, fire hydrants shall be located no more than 500 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structure and shall be on an eight-inch water line main. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply improvements shall be installed and approved by the county fire chief before any final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.

Sec. 160-76. - Final plat approval.
(a)
At the time for final plat approval the subdivider shall be required to submit certifications from the county engineer that the streets, utilities and other required improvements have been installed in an acceptable manner and according to the specifications and standards of these regulations and other ordinances. The county engineer shall have five working days from notification of completion by the subdivider to perform an inspection of the improvements and notify the director of community development of the results. If the required improvements have not been completed the applicant may, upon the approval of the director of community development, post a bond, certified check or appropriate letter of credit, herein after called a bond. Such bond amount shall be estimated by the applicant's registered engineer and be approved by the county engineer as sufficient to secure to the county the satisfactory installation of all required improvements or the uncompleted portion thereof. Performance bonds shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the county attorney as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. Such bonds shall be approved by the county commission as to amount and surety and other conditions deemed satisfactory to the county commission. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified by the county commission in the resolution approving the final plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not exceed two years from the date of final approval. The county engineer may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the county commission at a public meeting, extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The county may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond upon recommendation of the county engineer and county attorney.
(b)
Once certified by the community development director that the final plat meets county codes and ordinances, the director shall forward the plat to the county commission for action.
(c)
Upon approval of the final plat by the county commission, the community development director shall have the plat signed by the appropriate county officials and have a full-size positive copy of the original made and submit the original and full-size positive copy to the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county for recording. The original final plat shall be returned to the land surveyor that certified the plat.
(d)
Inspection of improvements for benefit of applicant. Where a bond has been posted the county commission shall provide upon the applicant's request an inspection of required improvements during construction to ensure their satisfactory completion and to reduce the bond. In this event, the applicant shall pay to the county an inspection fee of one-half of one percent of the amount of the performance bond or $50.00, which ever is greater. Fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the county and no certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the county engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the county's standards and specifications, the applicants shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of installing improvements is covered by a bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be individually and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications.
