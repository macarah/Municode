Solar farms shall be fenced in using a chain link fence with a height of at least six feet with anticlimb devices with three barbed wire line arms or otherwise acceptable to the county code enforcement department, brightly colored signs no smaller than one foot by two feet shall be posted on the fence every 100 feet warning of danger and high voltage.
(3)
Abutting residential properties with occupied or habitable residences within 450 feet and having an otherwise direct visual path if not screened shall be visually screened year-round from any solar farms to the reasonable satisfaction of the county code enforcement department through any one or a combination of planting or existing vegetation or fencing, all of which shall be at least six feet in height at maturity.

(7)
All electrical collection lines within a solar farm's boundaries, except for power lines that leave the project or are within the substation, shall be underground, however collector lines between sections within the farm may be overhead where economically advisable and consistent with common industry practice. The county code enforcement department may also grant written exceptions due to severe environmental or economic constraints and other considerations.
(8)
Lighting of a solar farm and its accessory structures shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation and shall be reasonably shielded from abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of a solar farm shall be directed downward and shall incorporate full cutoff fixtures to reduce light pollution.

Any solar farm that has not been in use for a period of 180 consecutive days for its original purpose as approved by the county code enforcement department shall be deemed abandoned and shall not be authorized to recommence operations until a new application and inspection have been completed.
(13)
No later than 180 days after abandonment or closure, the owners and operators of a solar farm shall remove the solar energy system, its equipment and panels, and any appurtenant structures.

If the deficiencies are not corrected within those three days, or in the event a remedy is not feasible within this three-day time period and the permit holder does not submit a reasonable cure plan within the three-day period, the county code enforcement department may revoke the solar farm's permit and require the solar farm to submit a new application before recommencing operations. During the time that a solar farm permit is revoked, the solar farm shall post a sign at each entrance to the solar farm no smaller than one foot by two feet stating: "This solar farm's operations have ceased due to noncompliance with the Charlton County Code of Ordinances.
