m.
Street hierarchy and associated sidewalk requirements. Each street within a district shall be classified according to the following (arterial streets should not bisect a traditional neighborhood development):
i.
Collector. This street provides access to commercial or mixed-use buildings, but it is also part of the city's major street network. On-street parking, whether diagonal or parallel, helps to slow traffic. Additional parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings. Sidewalks, a minimum of five feet in width, are required on both sides of the street.
ii.
Sub-collector. This street provides primary access to individual residential properties and connects streets of lower and higher function. Design speed is 25 mph. Sidewalks, a minimum of five feet in width, are required on both sides of the street.
iii.
Local street. This street provides primary access to individual residential properties. Traffic volumes are relatively low, with a design speed of 20 mph. Sidewalks, a minimum of five feet in width, are required on both sides of the street.
iv.
Alley. These streets provide secondary access to residential properties where street frontages are narrow, where the street is designed with a narrow width to provide limited on-street parking, or where alley access development is desired to increase residential densities. Alleys may also provide delivery access or alternate parking access to commercial properties.
n.
Street layout. The district shall maintain the existing street grid, where present, and restore any disrupted street grid where feasible. In addition:
i.
Intersections shall be at right angles whenever possible, but in no case less than 75 degrees. Low volume streets may form three-way intersections creating an inherent right-of-way assignment (the through street receives precedence), which significantly reduces accidents without the use of traffic controls.
ii.
Corner radii. The roadway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a maximum radius of 15 feet for local streets and 20 feet for intersections involving collector or arterial streets. The intersection of a local street and an access lane or alley shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a maximum radius of 10 feet.
iii.
Curb cuts. Curb cuts for driveways to individual residential lots shall be prohibited along arterial streets. Curb cuts shall be limited to intersections with other streets or access drives to parking areas for commercial, civic or multi-family residential uses.
iv.
Clear sight triangles shall be maintained at intersections, as specified below, unless controlled by traffic signal devices:
EXPAND
Intersection of: Minimum sight distance:
Local street and collector 120 feet.
Collector and collector 130 feet.
Collector and arterial 50 feet.
  o.
Street orientation.
i.
The orientation of streets should enhance the visual impact of common open spaces and prominent buildings and minimize street gradients.
ii.
All streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land, except local streets may terminate in stub streets when such streets act as connections to future phases of the development.
iii.
Local streets may terminate other than at other streets or public land when there is a connection to the pedestrian and bicycle path network at the terminus.
p.
Parking. Parking areas for shared or community use shall be encouraged. In addition:
i.
In the mixed-use area, any parking lot shall be located at the rear or side of a building.
ii.
A parking lot or garage may not be adjacent to or opposite a street intersection.
q.
Landscaping and screening standards. Overall composition and location of landscaping shall complement the scale of the development and its surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas.
i.
General screening. Where required by this section, it shall be at least six feet in height, unless otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at least 50 percent opaque throughout the year. Required screening shall be satisfied by one or some combination of: a decorative fence not less than 50 percent opaque behind a continuous landscaped area, a masonry wall, or a hedge.
ii.
Street trees. A minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per 40 feet of street frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be required. Acceptable street trees are identified in table 103-11 (Canton Plant Palette) of this UDC. Trees can be clustered and do not need to be evenly spaced. No tree shall be planted closer than two feet from a public street or sidewalk. In those instances where trees are planted closer than five feet from a public street or sidewalk, either concrete or HDPE root barriers must be installed. Root barriers must be a minimum of 30 inches deep, but depending upon size, location and species of tree to be planted, the community development director may require the root barrier to be 36 inches to 42 inches deep. Alternative methods of root barriers may be considered at the discretion of the community development director. If placement of street trees within the right-of-way will interfere with utility lines, trees may be planted within the front yard setback adjacent to the sidewalk.
r.
Parking area landscaping and screening. All parking and loading areas fronting public streets or sidewalks, and all parking and loading areas abutting residential districts or uses, shall provide:
i.
A landscaped area at least five feet wide along the public street or sidewalk.
ii.
Screening at least four feet in height and not less than 50 percent opaque.
iii.
One tree for each 25 linear feet of parking lot frontage.
s.
Parking area interior landscaping.
i.
The corners of parking lots, "islands," and all other areas not used for parking or vehicular circulation shall be landscaped. Vegetation can include turf grass, native grasses or other perennial flowering plants, vines, shrubs or trees. Such spaces may include architectural features such as benches, kiosks or bicycle parking.
ii.
Specific planting requirements shall adhere to section 103.03.04 of this UDC.

104.03.20 - Sexually oriented business.
A.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this Code section to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
B.

1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
2)
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
3)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
C.
Classification. The classifications for sexually oriented businesses shall be as follows:
1)

104.03.25 - Wireless telecommunication facilities (communication towers).
A.
Purpose. This section is designed and intended to balance the interests of the city's residents, telecommunications providers and telecommunications customers in the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this section shall:
1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city.
2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities.
3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques.
4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas.
5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city.
6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunications tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers.
7)
Encourage and promote the location of new wireless telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
B.
Overall policy and desired goals for telecommunications facilities. In order to ensure that the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities protects the health, safety, public welfare, environmental features, the nature and character of the community and neighborhood and other aspects of the quality of life specifically listed elsewhere in this section, the city adopts an overall policy with respect to granting a conditional use permit (CUP) for wireless telecommunications facilities for the express purpose of achieving the following goals:
1)
Requiring a CUP in accordance with requirements of this section for any new wireless telecommunications facility.
2)
Requiring a permit (not a CUP) in accordance with requirements of this section for any new collocation or modification of a wireless telecommunications facility.
3)
Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the sharing and/or collocation of wireless telecommunications facilities among service providers.
4)
Requiring, promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the placement, height and quantity of wireless telecommunications facilities in such a manner, including but not limited to the use of stealth technology, to minimize adverse aesthetic and visual impacts on the land, property, buildings, and other facilities adjacent to, surrounding, and in generally the same area as the requested location of such wireless telecommunications facilities, which shall mean using the least visually and physically intrusive facility that is not technologically or commercially impracticable under the facts and circumstances.
5)
In granting a CUP, the city has found that the facility shall be in the most appropriate site as regards being the least visually intrusive among those available in the city.
C.
Exceptions from a conditional use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities.
1)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, wireless telecommunications facilities that existed on or before the effective date of this UDC shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, provided however, that any visible modification or substantial change (as defined in this UDC) of an existing wireless telecommunications facility will require the complete facility, including the tower if applicable, and any new installation to comply with this section, as will anything changing the structural load.
2)
Any repair and maintenance of a wireless facility not requiring additional construction or site modification does not require an application for a CUP.
3)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the collocation and/or shared use of antennas on existing telecommunication towers or other tall structures or compatible use structures, such as water towers and other towers, that are proven by an applicant to be structurally adequate to accommodate the collocation shall be exempt from the public hearing requirement otherwise required for a tower, and shall be subject only to administrative review by the community development director.
D.
Exclusions. The following shall be exempt from this section:
1)
Public service facilities owned and operated by the City of Canton.
2)
Any facilities expressly exempt from the city's siting, building and permitting authority.
3)
Any facilities that are exempted from local regulation by the Federal Communications Commission.

Conflicts with the provisions of this section;
g.
Failure to submit a complete application as required under this section.
F.
Preferred location sites.
1)
Collocation sites. Any existing wireless telecommunications towers currently in use shall be preferred location sites regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this section, and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the community development director, and the site is not on a property zoned or used for residential purposes.
2)
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include but are not limited to facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
G.
Collocation.
1)
The city, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, requires wireless facilities to be located on existing towers or other suitable structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure, unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing towers and antenna, as well as suitable structures, inside the city limits and within one mile of the location of any proposed new tower.
2)
An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.
3)

4)
Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
J.
Abandoned facilities. Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it.
1)
The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility.
2)
If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment, it shall be considered a nuisance, and the city may proceed under the nuisance abatement procedures to remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal.
3)
The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed.

i.
The community development director shall approve or disapprove the application and also advise the applicant in writing of his or her final decision within 90 calendar days of the date an application for modification or collocation is field with the community development department, unless another date is specified in a written agreement between the community development director and the applicant. To the maximum extent practical, the community development department shall render decisions within 15 business days after receipt of a complete application.
ii.
Within 30 calendar days of the date an application for modification or collocation of wireless facilities is filed with the community development department, said department shall determine if is a complete application and, if it determines the application is not a complete application, notify the applicant in writing of any information required to complete such application. To the extent additional information is required to complete the application, the time required by the applicant to provide such information shall not be counted toward a maximum 90-day review period set forth in subsection a. above.
b.
For a proposed modification of an existing base station or tower that does not "substantially change" (see glossary for definition) the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, the following process applies:
i.
Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits a request seeking approval under this section, the community development director shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this subsection.
ii.
The 60-day period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement or in cases where the community development department determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.
iii.
To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the community development department must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Such delineated information does not require documentation intended to illustrate the need for such wireless facilities or to justify the business decision to modify such wireless facilities.
iv.
The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the community development department's notice of incompleteness.
v.
Following a supplemental submission, community development department will have ten days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
7)
Conditional use permits and variances.
a.
A request for a CUP pursuant to this section shall be initiated by application to the community development director and handled in accordance with the cup provision in chapter 105 of this UDC and in accordance with the Permit Procedures requirements of section 104.03.25.L. City council may issue a CUP under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the applicable requirements in chapter 105 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties.
b.
A request for a variance shall be initiated by application to the community development director and handled in accordance with the variance provision of chapter 105 of this UDC. The board of zoning appeals may issue a variance under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the application requirements in chapter 105 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties.
c.
In granting a CUP or variance, the city council or board of zoning appeals may impose additional conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.
M.
Basic requirements.

Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the community development director.
2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
To the extent that the holder of a CUP for wireless telecommunications facilities has not received relief, or is otherwise exempt, from appropriate state and/or federal agency rules or regulations, then the holder of such a CUP shall adhere to, and comply with, all applicable rules, regulations, standards, and provisions of any state or federal agency including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Specifically included in this requirement are any rules and regulations regarding height, lighting, security, electrical and RF emission standards.
b.
To the extent that applicable rules, regulations, standards, and provisions of any state or federal agency including, but not limited to, the FAA and the FCC, and specifically including any rules and regulations regarding height, lighting, and security are changed and/or are modified during the duration of a conditional use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, then the holder of such a CUP shall conform the permitted wireless telecommunications facilities to the applicable changed and/or modified rule, regulation, standard, or provision within a maximum of 24 months of the effective date of the applicable changed and/or modified rule, regulation, standard, or provision, or sooner as may be required by the issuing entity.
3)
Height.
a.
All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.
b.
The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
c.
The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 120 feet above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The one 120-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
d.
Notwithstanding the 120-foot maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within the city and only within the city.
e.
Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.

a.
No illumination is allowed on wireless telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency or competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety.
b.
If lighting is required or necessary, the community development director may review the available lighting alternative and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
6)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this section are met.
7)
Visual impact.
a.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely comparable with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by city council or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained, in accordance with section 104.03.25.N.1.
8)
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
a.

The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. The site plan/landscape plan shall be approved by the community development director prior to any land disturbance.
b.
The community development director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes; for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms; or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the community development director.
9)
Maintenance impacts.
a.
Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion.
b.
Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
10)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed, but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or placed on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
11)
Lot size and setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the community development director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this subsection if the goals of this section would be better served thereby:
a.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
b.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
c.
Telecommunications facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 104.03.25.M.
d.
For an antenna attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a one-to-one (1:1) setback ratio (example: A ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires a ten-foot setback from the edge of the roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
12)
Additional requirements for towers.
a.
Telecommunications facility site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunications towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
b.
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
c.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
d.
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable per subsection i. of this subsection.
e.
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height.
f.
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a zoning district.
g.
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by city council or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
h.
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing, not less than six feet in height, and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access, in accordance with section 104.02.01B.9.
i.
Placement of more than one tower on a lot may be allowed provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures if one fails.

2)
Failure to act. If the city staff fails to submit a report within 30 days after it has received the proposed cottage housing development application, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval to the mayor and city council. The city staff and the applicant may jointly agree to a 30-day postponement if notice of such agreement shall be sent to the mayor and city council. In any case, all materials concerning the proposed cottage housing development shall be forwarded to the mayor and city council no later than 60 days from the receipt of an application certified as complete.

City council hearing and final action. The mayor and city council shall review and consider the proposed application and materials for a public hearing.

Is the proposed development suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property?
2)
Does the proposed development adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
3)
Does the proposed development result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools?

A copy of this authorization together with a copy of the materials submitted by the applicant shall be sent to the planning and zoning board.
