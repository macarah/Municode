101.10.03 - Scope.
Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall govern. Where differences occur between provisions of the property maintenance code and the referenced standards, the provisions of the property maintenance code shall apply. Where, in a specific case, different subsections of the property maintenance code or other Canton codes or ordinances specify different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
A.
Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by the property maintenance code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good working order.
1)
No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service, facility, equipment or utility which is required under this section to be removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are in progress.
2)
The requirements of the property maintenance code are not intended to provide the basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing structures. Also, the requirements of the property maintenance code are not intended to supersede, and shall not be substituted, for any requirements of any other Canton adopted code or ordinance in effect at the time a building, residence or other structure was constructed, altered or repaired.
3)
Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings, structures and premises, including accessory structures and pools. The cleanliness and sanitation of the interior of buildings, dwellings and structures, as well as that of the exterior premises and the sanitation of pools, spas and hot tubs attached thereto and under the control of the occupant, shall be the responsibility of the current occupant. If such occupant or owner's designated agent fails to correct any requirements under the property maintenance code, the responsibility shall fall upon the property owner in accordance with the procedures and provision of the property maintenance code and the current construction codes and other provisions adopted by the City of Canton, whichever is more stringent.
B.
Unsafe structures and equipment. See under the violation of property maintenance code section in chapter 105 of this UDC.
C.
Existing remedies. The provisions in the property maintenance code shall not be construed to abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous, unsafe and unsanitary.
D.
Workmanship. Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of the property maintenance code shall be executed and installed in a professional manner and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions as well as the current construction codes and other provisions adopted by the City of Canton.
E.
Historic buildings. The provisions of the property maintenance code shall not be mandatory for existing buildings or structures designated as historic buildings when enforcement of such provisions would detrimentally alter their historical significance and when such buildings or structures are judged by the code official to be reasonably safe and in the public interest.
F.
Exception. Where enforcement of a code provision would violate the conditions of the listing of the equipment or appliance, the conditions of the listing shall apply.
G.
Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, as well as "changes of occupancy", shall be done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of the latest adopted construction codes and other applicable ordinances of the City of Canton and nothing in the property maintenance code shall be construed to cancel, modify or set aside any provision thereof.
