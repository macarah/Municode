105.03.04 - Behavior and ethics.

Disclose confidential information acquired by reason of his/her official position or use such information to secure special privileges or exemptions for himself/herself or others.
2)
Use or attempt to use his/her official position to secure special privileges for himself/herself or others.
3)
Knowingly receive, accept, take, seek to solicit, directly or indirectly, any gift or loan for himself/herself or another if the gift or loan tends to influence him/her in the discharge of his/her official duties, but this subsection does not apply to an occasional non-pecuniary gift having a value of less than $50.00, an award publicly presented, any bona-fide loan made in the ordinary course of business or political campaign contributions actually used in a political campaign.
4)
Participate in any BZA action which may result in a private benefit. The private benefit may be direct or indirect, create a material, personal gain or provide an advantage to relations or to friends, or to groups and associations which hold some share of the person's loyalty. However, mere membership itself in a group or organization shall not be considered a conflict of interest as to BZA action concerning such group or association unless a reasonable person would conclude that such membership in itself would prevent an objective consideration of the matter.
B.
The BZA recognizes that in the performance of its duties, matters will be presented and considered upon which one or more members may have or perceive that they have a conflict of interest due to economic, personal or other reasons, the existence of which will or may be perceived by other members of the BZA or general public as having the potential for interfering or influencing the member's unbiased consideration and vote. It is the policy of the BZA to require and encourage a full and accurate disclosure of such conflicts or potential conflicts at the earliest possible time so that the BZA may determine whether a member may or should abstain from participation and voting.
C.
Consistent with this policy, each member has a duty to disclose any conflicts or potential conflicts and the relevant facts to the extent it does not violate a confidence, to the BZA at the first meeting at which the matter creating the potential conflict is considered. The member's disclosure shall include an indication of whether the potential conflict disclosed will interfere or influence their consideration and vote and whether the member wishes to be permitted to abstain from voting.
D.
After a disclosure or potential conflict is made by a member and discussed by the BZA, whether the member may or shall abstain from discussion and voting shall be decided by motion and majority vote of the members in attendance at the meeting.
E.
If a majority of the BZA votes to allow the BZA member disclosing the potential conflict to abstain from the discussion and voting, the BZA member disclosing the potential conflict shall leave the room in which the meeting is taking place until such time as the BZA has completed discussion and voting on the matter related to the potential conflict.
F.
Any questions or claims that a member has failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest shall be presented at the first meeting when the matter alleged to create the conflict is considered by the BZA. If such questions or claims are made, and after the member with the alleged conflict has had the opportunity to respond, which shall include a statement on whether they wish to vote or abstain, the BZA shall resolve the claim and the member's voting rights by motion to permit or require the member to abstain from consideration and voting. If the member has indicated a desire to participate and vote on the matter, a concurring vote of at least five members of the BZA is required to prohibit said participation and voting.
G.
A BZA member shall not personally appear before the BZA as an applicant or as a representative of an applicant during the member's term of office.
H.
With the exception of the chairperson, a BZA member shall not indicate representation of the BZA when speaking to individuals, groups or organizations on general BZA matters unless authorized by the BZA to do so. When speaking for personal purposes on matters that may come before the BZA, the BZA member shall indicate that the stated opinions and beliefs are not necessarily the opinions and beliefs of the BZA as a whole.
I.
The BZA, or its members, shall not intrude into the management of the community development department or into those matters which are best handled administratively within the department.
J.
BZA members shall conduct themselves at BZA meetings in a fair, courteous, and understanding manner. BZA members shall avoid interchanges involving personality differences.
K.
A BZA member shall not engage in ex parte communications with an applicant or with a representative of an applicant.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)
105.03.05 - Meeting procedures and decorum.
A.
The BZA conducts hearings to decide appeals related to the enforcement or application of this UDC by the community development director or to authorize upon appeal a variance from the terms of this UDC. These hearings on matters are brought by property owners or their authorized representatives to determine whether or not the subject property in question should be approved for the action requested by the applicant.
B.
The BZA utilizes "Roberts Rules of Order" for conducting its meetings.
C.
The BZA expects its meetings to be conducted in a businesslike manner and has promulgated the following rules of procedure and decorum for all speakers on matters before the BZA:
1)
All persons attending a BZA hearing are required to sign the sign-in sheet confirming attendance at the meeting. Opponents of an application are required by Georgia law to fill out a disclosure form relating to campaign contributions prior to voicing their opposition to any application.
2)
The BZA conducts its meetings in a businesslike manner and will not tolerate verbal outbursts, clapping, cheering, heckling, side comments, etc. All comments concerning the application are to be addressed to the BZA and not to the applicant or other interested party.
3)
Signs, placards, posters, etc. are not permitted within the meeting room and must be left outside. Display boards reflecting matters and plans that are a part of the application may be used by the applicant and referred to by other speakers.
4)
The proponents and the opponents of an application are limited to ten minutes for presentation of their respective viewpoints, unless more time is allowed by a vote of the BZA, in which case equal additional time shall be allowed for each side. As such, in the event that more than one person desires to address a particular position, applicants and/or opponents are encouraged to designate spokespersons to present their positions concerning the application. Those persons that reside within the incorporated limits of the City of Canton shall be given the opportunity to speak before those persons that reside outside of the incorporated limits of the City of Canton.
5)
While public opinion is encouraged as to applications, it is not necessary to state the same position or fact more than once to the BZA. The chairperson of the BZA may limit a presentation if the same positions and facts are made by subsequent speakers.
6)
Once the chairperson of the BZA declares the public hearing closed, there will be no more comments accepted from any member of the audience unless a member of the BZA asks a specific question of a specific person. All comments and side comments are to cease at the time while the BZA goes into deliberations concerning the application.
7)
Any person violating any of these rules of procedure and decorum will be requested by the chairperson of the BZA to cease such activity upon a verbal warning. If it is necessary to issue another warning, any person or persons are subject to removal from the meeting by the City of Canton Police.
