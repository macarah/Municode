(a)
No building, structure, land, lot or portion of a lot shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, unless the use or occupancy is in conformity with the codes and ordinances in effect in the city at the time a permit is issued, or an application is made for a permit, and all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.

(Min. of 11-10-2016, § 5.4; Ord. No. 2019-0002, § 3, 3-14-2019)
Sec. 47-62. - Lots; creation of illegal lots.
(a)
Lot reduction. It is not permitted to reduce an existing lot below minimum standards. Specifically, no lot shall be reduced in size so that the mandatory lot frontage or depth; front, side or rear yard; width at building line; or lot area are not maintained. Lots of record that do not meet existing standards may not be reduced. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public purposes.
(b)
Illegal lots. It is not permitted to split or subdivide any lot if any of the resultant lots are under the minimum size lot allowed in the zoning district. Creation of a new lot under the minimum size requirement of the relevant zoning district is not permitted, nor is leaving a remnant under the minimum size requirement. It is not permitted to reduce an existing lot's size under the minimum size requirement. Any subdivision or creation of a substandard lot is illegal and shall not create any vested right nor permit any nonconforming use.
(c)
Substandard single lots. Where the owner of a lot of record or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this chapter, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted.
(d)
Substandard adjoining lots. If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or amendment thereto and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width, and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size, and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.
(e)
The following illustrations shall exemplify how the various terms used in regards to lots and setbacks in this zoning ordinance should be interpreted:
(Min. of 11-10-2016, § 5.5; Ord. No. 2019-0002, § 3, 3-14-2019)
Sec. 47-63. - Road frontage restrictions; private driveways and easements.
No new lot shall be created, nor shall any principal building be erected, on any lot which does not have immediate access and frontage, of a minimum amount as specified in article V of this chapter, on at least one existing public road or on a newly created internal street in a development. The minimum road frontage requirements are defined in article V of this chapter based on the underlying zoning district.

Sec. 47-66. - Fence requirements.
(a)
It is the purpose of the mayor and city council in enacting these regulations to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property, and welfare by regulating the location, size, height, and quality of materials of fences in residential and commercial zoning districts. This section does not apply to fences in industrial districts. This section does not apply to fencing for detention ponds.
(b)
No fence shall constitute an obstruction to the vision for or create a hazard to vehicular traffic. No fence shall constitute an obstruction or hazard to utilities.

(c)
In all residential and commercial zoning districts, fences shall not exceed five feet in height in a front yard, as defined in this chapter, and shall not exceed eight feet in height in a side or rear yard. Any fence which extends into the front yard shall not be opaque. Any such front yard fence may be constructed of brick, stone, wood, wrought iron, split rail, chain link, or other material as approved by the community development director. No fence shall be constructed of razor wire (ribbon), chicken wire, exposed concrete block, tires, junk, or discarded building materials.
