(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-80. - Water capacity analysis.
Water capacity analysis is a process where every new development which will require connection of its potable water service to the city water system is reviewed to determine whether or not the new development will meet the minimum fire flow and pressure requirement of 20 psi at the highest occupied elevation under normal usage conditions or cause some other proximate user's pressure to drop below 20 psi under normal usage conditions. All proposed fire hydrants shall be capable of delivering 1,000 gallons per minute (gpm) in residential neighborhoods and 1,500 gpm in commercial areas or as otherwise determined by the county fire marshal based upon the type of development.
(1)
The proposed water consumption flowrate(s) of the new development will be assumed to be equal to the average proposed sewage flows estimated per Georgia Manual for On-site Sewage Management Systems Table JT-1 with an appropriate peaking factor based on diurnal variations.
(2)
The city's water system has been modeled with the use of a hydraulic modeling application. The proposed flowrates will be added to the model in order to calculate the residual pressure.
(3)
If the new development's residual pressure does not meet the requirement of 20 psi at the highest occupied elevation under normal usage conditions, or, cannot meet the fire flow requirements set forth above, the analyzed water line will be assumed to be unsuitable for the new development. If the developer wants access, the developer may pay the city in an appropriate amount to upgrade to a new water line so as to provide adequate residual pressure.
