Open space not to be encroached upon. No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in this article. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers are not considered to be encroachments of setbacks. Open space areas as required by this article must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this article.
(7)
Reduction of setbacks or lot area. Except as otherwise provided in this article, a lot existing at the time of passage of this article may not be reduced, divided, or changed as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this article for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use.
(8)
Lots with multiple frontage. In the case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street.
(9)
Landlocked lots. In the case of a landlocked lot (a lot without direct access to a public street or road) lawfully existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the property owner is entitled to one building permit, as long as all of the following requirements are met:
a.
No other principal building exists or is being constructed on the property.
b.
No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this article and is currently valid.
c.
The property was and continues to be under single ownership since the effective date of this article.

Substandard lots. Any lot existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived which has an area or a width which is less than required by this article is subject to the following exceptions and modifications:
a.
Adjoining lots in same ownership. When two or more adjoining and vacant lots are within a non-approved development with continuous frontage and are in single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots must be replatted so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district.
b.
Single lots. When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this article are met.

(16)
State waters. If a lot is bounded by or contains drainage or natural surface water features, the community development director may require an environmental assessment from a licensed and qualified environmental engineer to determine whether the waters are state waters and the bounds thereof, and whether buffers are required. The method used to determine that buffers are necessary based on information defined by the EPD publication, "The Field Guide for Determining the Presence of State Waters that Require a Buffer" (including the presence of base flow) should be provided in the assessment. The environmental assessment should include photographs of the site and water feature and a plat or survey identifying the location of the water feature on or adjacent to the property.
(17)
Multifamily developments. Whenever a lot is planned to be developed as a multifamily residential development under common ownership or without subdivision, it shall be subject to the same procedures for review of a preliminary plat, construction plat and as-built plat as a multifamily subdivision, including review by the unified zoning board, to ensure compliance with the purposes and intent of these development regulations and the zoning ordinance.

Sec. 10-161. - Construction requirements for residential and nonresidential subdivision streets.
The grading, base, and pavement for street construction shall be as follows:
(1)
Grading. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans.
a.
The contractor may begin clearing and grubbing the project after:
1.
A development permit has been issued by the city; and
2.
All required erosion control measures have been installed and approved.
b.
Clearing and grubbing.
1.
All trees, stumps, logs, roots, grass, weeds, poles, and other objectionable matter shall be cleared and grubbed from within the construction limits of the project.
2.
No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing and grubbing of the roadway shall be buried at the site.
3.
If burning is permitted, all burn pits shall be located outside of the roadway construction limits. After burning, the pit shall be cleared out. A city inspection is required prior to backfilling and must be shown on the final plat.
c.
Excavation.
1.
All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material for the roadway with the top 12 inches compacted to 100 percent maximum dry density, 95 percent below the top.
2.
In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12 inches and backfilled with suitable material.
3.
All rock and boulders in the roadbed shall be excavated and the space backfilled to the correct grade with suitable material.
4.
Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the roadway may not be placed in any roadway fill area except when approved by the community development director and then under his supervision.
5.
During the construction of the roadway on a day-to-day basis, the roadbed edges shall be kept lower than the center, and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill shall be kept reasonably smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditches or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes.
d.
Placement of fill.
1.
Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed.
2.
All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density of the surrounding soil before placement of the fill begins.
3.
The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches.
4.
Before the placement of fill material begins, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil.
5.
Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12 inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted.
6.
In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exist, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material.
7.
All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment.
8.
Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted.
9.
Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density.
10.
The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers.
11.
While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface.
12.
The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary.
e.
Final finishing of roadway.
1.
After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire road bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine, supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross section.
2.
Slopes of cuts and fills shall also be carefully shaped to the true section specified.
3.
When final shaping is finished, the road surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown on plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished roadbed.
4.
All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the roadway.
(2)
Placement of curb and gutter.
a.
After sanitary sewer lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the roadway has been approved by the community development director, and the centerline profile has been approved, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin.
b.
Any curb and gutter which does not conform to a true section, texture, line, and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the community development director.
c.
Water lines shall be installed after installation of the curb and gutter.
(3)
Subgrade.
a.
Before placing any pavement base, the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required, it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time.
b.
After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material.
c.
The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch.
d.
The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch.
(4)
Base construction.
a.
The community development director shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any base material.
b.
The community development director may authorize the placing of the base material after all equipment necessary for the proper construction of the road base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density.
c.
The community development director shall check the completed base course after the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified, or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross section.
d.
After the compacted material has been approved, field tests shall be taken by the field contractor and development inspector, or by a professional engineer as directed by the community development director or designee to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Tests shall be taken at 1,000 feet intervals alternating between each lane and center of roadway. Measurements shall be taken per GDOT-21, GDOT-42 or GDOT-59 methods of test for measurement of thickness of bases and subbases. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the community development director. No asphalt course shall be placed until deficiencies in base have been adequately addressed.
e.
A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased.
f.
All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent graded aggregate construction sections of the state department of transportation "Standard Specifications," latest edition.
(5)
Soil cement. A soil cement base may be used to improve the subgrade with approval by the city but shall not be used as a substitute for base construction. Soil testing and mix design must be performed by the developer and approved by the community development director.
(6)
Paving.
a.
The contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement upon approval of the road base by the community development director.
b.
All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the state department of transportation "Standard Specifications," latest edition.
c.
The community development director or designee shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the community development director.
d.
If, in the opinion of the community development director or designee, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the roadway is opened to traffic.
e.
A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the community development director at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated, the community development director may require a minimum one inch overlay of the streets.
f.
The GAB (base) thickness is to be measured and accepted by the city prior to placement of any asphalt course. The applicant shall have core tests made to verify the thickness and compaction of the asphalt pavement course. The minimum core diameter shall be such that compaction of the sample can be determined in the lab and subsequent data supplied to the community development director. The compaction of the course shall be required to meet state department of transportation specifications per the asphalt mix placed. If a two-course asphalt section is required, the cores for the binder layer shall be cut, reviewed, and approved by the community development director prior to placement of the topping lift. Also, in the event that a two course asphalt section is required, the cores for the topping lift, if between 1½ inch and 1¼ inch in thickness, shall be made to determine the thickness only. All cores shall be made on 1,000 feet intervals, alternating between each lane and center of roadway. If these cores indicate a deficiency in thickness or compaction of the asphalt pavement, an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur:
1.
When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance, or deficient in compaction, exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street.
2.
When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance or a deficiency in compaction. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance or compaction, additional cores shall be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness/compaction.
g.
The applicant shall correct any deficiency with an overlay extending a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than 1¼ inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the community development director.
(7)
Shoulder and drainage improvements. After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be backfilled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An 80 percent stand of grass shall be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be backfilled and compacted to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
(8)
Compliance with minimum standards. Road design and construction for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown below in the Residential Subdivision Street Roadway Standards Table. For roadways with more than 150 lots of contributing traffic, a pavement design is to be done and submitted to the community development director for review.

Sec. 10-171. - Illicit discharge and illegal connection.
(a)
Description. An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system.
(b)
Introduction. It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's separate storm sewer system.
It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(c)

Within ten calendar days of receipt of a completed application for an administrative variance, the community development director shall approve the application as submitted, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application. If the community development director fails to issue a decision within ten days, the application shall be deemed automatically denied, and the applicant shall have a right of appeal to the unified zoning board pursuant to the provisions of this section.
(d)
Such administrative variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the community development director that one or more of the following exists:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
(2)
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship;
(3)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter;
(5)
A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed.
(e)
An administrative variance shall be granted or denied in writing. Notice of the grant of an administrative variance shall be sent to all adjoining property owners, either by certificate of mailing or certified mail, by community development department staff. The notice shall describe the variance granted and state that interested parties have 30 days in which to file an appeal of the variance to the unified zoning board. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. The 30 days shall be counted from the date of mailing of the notice. The community development director shall keep public records of all administrative variances applied for and granted pursuant to this chapter.

Sec. 10-179. - Industrial uses accessing city roads and streets.
(a)
Prior to the issuance of any building permit or certificate of occupancy for any industrial use which will be accessed directly from city streets, the occupant shall file a letter of intent with the city which shall state the nature of the operation and identify the types of traffic, including the types of commercial vehicles, which will access the site from the city roads and streets. The letter of intent shall describe the parking and loading needs of the use.

(c)
The building official may impose reasonable conditions on the use if reasonably necessary to protect the travelling public and to maintain the public roads or streets serving the proposed use.
