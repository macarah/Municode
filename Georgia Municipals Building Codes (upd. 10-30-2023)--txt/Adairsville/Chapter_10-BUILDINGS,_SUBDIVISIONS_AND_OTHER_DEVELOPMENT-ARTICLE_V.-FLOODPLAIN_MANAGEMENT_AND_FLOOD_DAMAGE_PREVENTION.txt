ARTICLE V. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT AND FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-199. - Introduction.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(c)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to private property;
(3)
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(d)
Article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 4.2)
Sec. 10-200. - Description.
(a)
Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the city integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process.
(b)
This article requires that the city regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land-use conditions, which are based upon the communities' adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The article also requires the city to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres and greater.
(c)
In order to administer this article, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established as follows:
(1)
Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, district-wide watershed management plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community.
(2)
For streams with a drainage area between 100 acres and 640 acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains or require the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant.
(3)
For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 10-219. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and,
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the building official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 10-340 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the community development department prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the community development department. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and
(4)
A preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(b)
Detailed flood studies in areas where floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established and in areas beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which may contain a watercourse and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be submitted showing the base flood elevations, future-conditions flood elevations, and the floodway. Approval of the study must be received before the final plat of the affected lots can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 4.19)
Sec. 10-318. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the community development department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the community development director.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 4.20)
Sec. 10-319. - Maintenance requirements.
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The community development department may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the community development department.

Sec. 10-369. - Procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the community development department or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the community development department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the community development department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the community development director shall have the right to appeal such decision to the unified zoning board as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the unified zoning board. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the unified zoning board may appeal such decision to the (appropriate court), as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the community development department and unified zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(8)
Conditions for variances.
