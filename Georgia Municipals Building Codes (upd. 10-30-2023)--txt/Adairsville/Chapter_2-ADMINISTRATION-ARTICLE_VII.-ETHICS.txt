ARTICLE VII. - ETHICS

Sec. 2-324. - Intent.
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that the members of its city council be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the city council. The city council finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the city council in situations where a conflict may exist.
