I will not knowingly permit my vote to be influenced by fear, favor, affection, or reward, and in all things pertaining to my office. I will be governed by the public good and the interests of the City. I will observe the provisions of the Charter, ordinances, and regulations of the City of Atlanta, and I will support and defend the Constitutions of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. I am not the holder of any office of trust under the government of the United States, any other state, or any foreign state which I am prohibited from holding by the laws of the State of Georgia; I am not the holder of any unaccounted-for public money due this state or any political subdivision or authority thereof; I have been a resident of the City of Atlanta [and Council District] and am otherwise qualified to hold this office by the Constitution and laws of this State and the Charter and ordinances of the City of Atlanta, so help me God."

Mandatory training. The mayor, president of the council, and councilmembers shall, following each regular Municipal General Election or such election held in place thereof, attend a mandatory training session that shall include, but not be limited to, matters of campaign and financial disclosure requirements, standards of conduct, ethics code and the legislative process.

The Municipal Clerk, shall hold, or cause to be held, a training session for all current and newly elected city of Atlanta officials that shall include, but not be limited to, matters of campaign and financial disclosure requirements, standards of conduct, ethics code, and the legislative process. Said training session shall be offered on two separate dates, but no later than July 1 of the year following each municipal general election or no later that 60 days following any election held in lieu thereof, and no later than 60 days following a Special Election held to fill a vacancy in office.

Attendance as noted shall be mandatory. Each official shall be required to sign an affidavit stating that he/she has completed training, with said affidavit to be certified by the Clerk or the Clerk's designee.
(2)
Any official required to attend who has not completed the mandatory training by the end of the second available training session, shall be deemed non-compliant and shall be immediately fined $50.00. An additional $100.00 fine shall continuously be assessed each non-compliant official, every 30 days after the date of non-compliance in which an official has not paid the assessed fine or received a waiver and completed a makeup training session as outlined in subsections (c)(5) and (6) of this section.

(4)
Immediately following the second offered training session, and if necessary upon the assessment of further fines, the Municipal Clerk shall notify, by certified mail, each official who has not completed mandatory training that he or she is in non-compliance of the law and of the penalty thereby imposed.

Any non-compliant official may submit, through the Chair of the Committee on Council, a written appeal to the Council requesting a waiver of the assessed fine. Supporting evidence of the reason(s) of his/her non-compliance must be presented in the appeal. If due cause is shown, the Council may adopt a resolution, by majority vote, to waive the fine.

Such session may be provided through a videotaped session, but shall cover in its entirety all required training modules. The non-compliant official's signed affidavit of completion of training and the Clerk's or the Clerk's designee's certification of same, shall be required to avoid further assessments of fines. There shall be no waiver of training attendance granted under any circumstances.
(7)
The Municipal Clerk shall develop, or cause to be developed, a manual detailing all of the above.
