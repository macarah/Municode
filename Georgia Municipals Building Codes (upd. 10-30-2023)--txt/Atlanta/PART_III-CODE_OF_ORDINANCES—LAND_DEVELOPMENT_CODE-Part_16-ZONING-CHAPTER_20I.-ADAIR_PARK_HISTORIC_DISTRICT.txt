Sec. 16-20I.002. - Scope of regulations.
(a)
The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Adair Park Historic District shall remain in full force and effect. The following zoning regulations (chapter 20I) shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. Whenever the following regulations conflict with said existing zoning regulations, the following regulations (chapter 20I) shall apply.
(b)
Except when otherwise explicitly provided, the provisions of chapter 20 of this part shall apply to this district. Whenever the regulations of chapter 20I conflict with the provisions of chapter 20, the regulations of chapter 20I shall apply.
(c)
All other statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, or other governmentally adopted regulations pertaining to properties within this district shall continue to apply. In the event of any conflict between said other regulations and the following regulations (chapter 20I) the interpretation provision set forth in section 16-20.011(c) of the Code of Ordinances shall govern.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.002; Ord. No. 2020-48(20-O-1146) , § 1, 9-17-20)
Sec. 16-20I.003. - Boundaries.
The boundaries of the Adair Park Historic District shall be as shown on the official zoning map adopted herewith entitled the "Adair Park Historic District." The district is divided into three subareas, as shown on said official zoning map, which shall be known as:
(1)
The Residential Subarea;
(2)
The Transitional Commercial Subarea; and
(3)
The Transitional Industrial Subarea.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.003; Ord. No. 2020-48(20-O-1146) , § 1, 9-17-20)
Sec. 16-20I.004. - Organization.
The overlay zoning regulations for the Adair Park Historic District are composed of four sections:
(1)
Section .005: General regulations and design review procedures that apply to all properties located within the District.
(2)
Section .006: Specific regulations for properties in the Residential Subarea I.
(3)
Section .007: Specific regulations for properties in the Transitional Commercial Subarea II.
(4)
Section .008: Specific regulations for properties in the Transitional Industrial Subarea III.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.004; Ord. No. 2020-48(20-O-1146) , § 1, 9-17-20)
Sec. 16-20I.005. - General regulations and design review procedures.
The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Adair Park Historic District.
(1)
General criteria.
a.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the correct type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Code.
b.
The commission shall use the following regulations only if the specific subarea regulations do not address the application:
1.
A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
2.
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided.
3.
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties.
4.
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
5.
Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved.
6.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials.
7.
Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. Painting of unpainted masonry is prohibited.
8.
Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
9.
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
10.
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(2)
The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of ensuring that alterations to existing structures and the design of proposed new construction are sensitive to and sympathetic toward existing elements of design, proportions, scale, massing, materials, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face, or where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."
(3)
Certificates of appropriateness: City of Atlanta applications used to review design, development and construction activities on properties or districts designated as Historic and Landmark by the City of Atlanta.
a.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit.
b.
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this district. Painting or repainting of any structure or portion thereof does not require a certificate of appropriateness, but must comply with section 16-20I.005(7).
c.
Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the urban design commission and shall be required for:
1.
All alterations to existing structures where visible from a public street or park, unless such alterations or additions are specifically exempted from certificates of appropriateness in the subarea regulations.
2.
Fences, walls, accessory structures, decks, rear porches, and paving.
3.
If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of section 16-20I.006, section 16-20I.007, or section 16-20I.008, as applicable, the director of the commission shall issue Type II certificate within 14 days of the application.
4.
If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of section 16-20I.006, section 16-20I.007, or section 16-20I.008, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of the application.
5.
Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates.
d.
Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for:
1.
All new principal structures.
2.
Additions that are visible from a public street or park, unless such additions are specifically exempted from a certificate of appropriateness in the subarea regulations.
3.
Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in floor area ratio, lot coverage, height or a change in the building footprint.
4.
Subdivisions and consolidations as required per section 16-20I.005(6).
5.
Variances and special exceptions.
e.
Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance.
(4)
Variances, special exceptions, and appeals. Variance applications, applications for special exceptions, and appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in chapter 25. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for appeal pursuant to the standards in section 16-30.010 and the appeal provisions for said decision, set forth in section 16-30.010(e), shall also apply to the commission's decision.
(5)
Financial hardship exemptions:
a.
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
b.
In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose.
c.
If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection 16-20I.005(5)b. herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
1.
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
2.
The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
3.
The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations;
4.
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and
5.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
d.
The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
(6)
Subdivisions or consolidations: In Subarea 1, the platting pattern of the Adair Park Historic District is an integral part of the historic character of the district. No subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless it can be shown that the proposed subdivision or consolidation is substantially consistent with the historic character of the district. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances all subdivisions or consolidations of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the Adair Park Historic District with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. The compatibility rule shall apply, and no subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless and until the urban design commission has made a finding that it is consistent with this provision or with the platting pattern of the neighborhood.
