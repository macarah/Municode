Sec. 16-18G.002. - Statement of intent.
The intent of the council in establishing the Candler Park Special Public Interest District is as follows:
(1)
To physically and architecturally reintegrate the Candler Park neighborhood by developing public park space and new low density housing in areas that were cleared as a result of public action for the construction of a freeway plan subsequently abandoned;
(2)
To provide for the development of new housing fronting the public park and to provide for open space so as to protect the views to and from the public park and open space.
(3)
To assure that the development and management of this neighborhood public park and open space provides a passive, neighborhood park space, including neighborhood facilities but not including any regional facilities such as an amphitheater, in a manner consistent with the Freedom Park Concept Plan.
(4)
To provide for the development of single-family and low-density housing on lots so specified in this chapter in order to implement the goals and objectives of the City of Atlanta Comprehensive Development Plan and the Freedom Park Concept Plan;
(5)
To provide through the administration of specific standards and criteria that new housing achieve architectural, site design and street design consistency with the identified significant characteristics of the Candler Park Historic District which is listed in the U.S. Department of Interior National Register of Historic Places.
(6)
To assure that in the process of knitting the neighborhood together through the construction of new housing and park space that the cumulative diversity which typifies the neighborhood is maintained through the prohibition of the repetition of any single house design within the same block face and other reasonable design regulations that are intended to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic significance of the district;
(7)
To encourage owner occupancy of new housing in single-family structures while permitting low-density multi-family housing in designated locations adjacent to Moreland Avenue;
(8)
To develop a transition from Freedom Parkway, the Carter Library and Policy Center, Druid Hills Historic District and the Candler Park Historic District, in a way that encourages visual continuities, urban design linkages, a coordinated park system, transportation corridors, existing historic neighborhood street patterns and an integrated pedestrian and bicyclist network of paths:
(9)
To prohibit future use of the parkland for any expressway or motorized vehicular purpose;
(10)
To provide distinct entrances into the Candler Park Historic District.

(2)
No building permit shall be issued by the bureau of buildings within the SPI-7 Candler Park District without the prior approval and issuance of a certificate of compliance from the Atlanta Urban Design Commission (AUDC). The purpose of this requirement is to assist the bureau of buildings with review of proposed permits for consistency with the requirements of sections 16-18G.006 through 16-18G.013 of this chapter. In addition to all materials otherwise required by the bureau of buildings, applications for building permits in these subareas shall include: a site plan at a minimum scale of one inch, equals 20 feet; typical building sections and exterior elevations at a minimum scale of one-fourth inch equals one foot; and outline specifications for all exterior building and landscaping materials.

The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate said consistency. If the application is consistent with said criteria and standards, it shall be approved and the AUDC shall issue a certificate of compliance certifying said compliance. The AUDC shall have the authority to impose conditions on said certificates as appropriate. If the application is not consistent with said criteria and standards, it shall be denied. Immediately following said action, the AUDC shall transmit the application together with its denial or approval to the bureau of buildings. The bureau of buildings shall then review the application for compliance with all remaining applicable provisions of this chapter and other applicable ordinances.

Sec. 16-18G.011. - Residential Subareas 2 and 3: Architectural requirements.
In addition to the regulations and provisions of this chapter, and except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the following architectural regulations shall apply.
(1)
Definitions. For the purposes of interpreting this code section, the following definitions shall apply;
a.
Neighborhood means the Candler Park Neighborhood as it exists on the official neighborhood map of the City of Atlanta.
b.
Substantially proportional means that the element in question, such as roof pitch, scale, mass, or height, is sufficiently proportional to that found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to identify the new construction as originating from said architectural style.
c.
Substantially characteristic means that the material in question, such as brickwork, stonework, or roofing material, reflects visual qualities that are sufficiently characteristic of those found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to confirm that the new construction is consistent with said architectural style.
(2)
Statement of intent. The council finds that the following established residential architectural styles currently exist in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique character: Late Victorian; Transitional style of bungalow between late Victorian and Craftsman; Bungalows with Greek Revival, Tudor or Craftsman detailing; American Four Square; and Queen Anne. These residential structures generally exhibit the following significant characteristics: small rectangular shaped lots; houses which are generally situated near the front centers of these lots and stand back a uniform distance from the streets; and, due to the hilly topography, many houses with low retaining walls at the sidewalk and with steps which lead up from the sidewalk. The purpose of the following regulations is to set forth basic, minimum standards of architectural design and construction that are consistent with these existing historic styles of residences within the neighborhood, as the cumulative historic diversity of the built environment is a defining characteristic of this neighborhood. It is not the intent of the regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of existing structures, but rather to foster residential design that incorporates the historic architectural elements and materials that are specific to the neighborhood in a meaningful, coherent manner. The following regulations are intended to achieve basic compatibility with these existing architectural styles while simultaneously encouraging consistent, creative designs that are more than a mere aggregation of random historic elements, through the use of specific standards and criteria. In addition, these regulations are intended to integrate the aesthetic and physical characteristics of new construction and landscape in this area into the existing neighborhood and public park areas in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety and welfare of the community.
(3)
Standards and criteria. The following standards and criteria shall apply to all new construction in the residential subareas:
a.
All new construction on each vacant lot shall be representative of a single architectural style chosen from those styles set forth in subsection (2) above.
b.
A paved walkway from the front sidewalk to the front entry of the principal structure shall be provided.
c.

d.
The form and pitch of the roof of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style.
e.
The height, scale and massing of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style. In no case shall the height of a structure exceed 35 feet. (See section 16-28.022 for excluded portions of structures.)
f.
The first floor of the principal structure shall be on foundations and elevated above grade a minimum of three entrance step risers, each of which shall be no less than seven inches in height.

Front porches shall contain roofs, balustrades, columns, steps, and other features typical of the chosen architectural style. Porches may be enclosed with screen wire or glass, provided that the main characteristics of the porch such as balustrades, columns or porch railings, and balusters are visible and maintained. Front porches may extend up to ten feet into the required front yard. All front porch steps shall have closed risers and ends.

The overall pattern of fenestration as it relates to the building façade.
4.
Generally, fenestration shall be double hung.
l.
