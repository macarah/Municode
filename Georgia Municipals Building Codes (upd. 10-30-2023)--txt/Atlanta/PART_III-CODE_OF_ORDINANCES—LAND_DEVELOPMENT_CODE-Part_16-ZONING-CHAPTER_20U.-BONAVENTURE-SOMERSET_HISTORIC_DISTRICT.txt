CHAPTER 20U. - BONAVENTURE-SOMERSET HISTORIC DISTRICT

Sec. 16-20U.001. - Statement of intent.
The intent of the regulations for the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District ("the District") is:
(1)
To preserve the overall architectural history and character of the buildings that were constructed in the District during the 1910-1935 development period, and to ensure that additions, alterations, and renovations to those buildings are consistent with the historic character of the individual structure;
(2)
To preserve the District's historic development patterns characterized primarily by single-family houses and multifamily buildings;
(3)
To retain the predominant historic and existing architectural forms and styles of the District, including Bungalow, Duplex, American Small House, American Foursquare, Single Building Apartment, and Garden/Courtyard Apartment forms; and Craftsman, Neoclassical Revival, Colonial Revival, Mediterranean Revival, and Italian Renaissance Revival styles;
(4)
To preserve the historic and as-built physical site planning patterns of the District, including spatial relationships between buildings, and between buildings and the public street;
(5)
To prevent the subdivision or aggregation of existing lots in any manner that would disrupt the historic platting pattern, lot sizes, and spatial relationships established during the 1910-1935 development period, or otherwise detract from the identified historic qualities of the District;
(6)
To encourage neighborhood revitalization and prevention of displacement of residents;
(7)
To ensure all new construction observes the general setbacks, height, scale and massing of the original and historic development and site planning patterns;
(8)
To ensure the construction of new principal structures is either compatible with the historic and existing architectural character of the District and is internally consistent to the identified predominant architectural forms and styles; or is of an architectural style that is internally consistent and clearly contemporary in style;
(9)
To encourage containment of existing commercial areas and discourage encroachment of the commercial areas into the District; and
(10)
To preserve and enhance the historic and architectural appearance of the District to substantially promote the public health, safety and general welfare.

The following general regulations and design review procedures shall apply to all properties in the District.
(1)
Certificates of appropriateness. City of Atlanta applications used to review design, development and construction activities on properties or districts designated as Historic and Landmark by the City of Atlanta.
a.
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this District. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required if a building permit is not required for such work within this District. Painting or repainting of any structure or portion thereof does not require a certificate of appropriateness, but must comply with Section 16.20U.007(1)(f) about painting unpainted historic masonry surfaces.

If the proposed activity does not meet the applicable District regulations, the director of the Commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of the application. Appeals from a decision of the director of the Commission about a Type II certificate of appropriateness by any aggrieved person shall be processed as prescribed in the appeals portion of Section 20.008(a) of the City of Atlanta Zoning Ordinance.
c.
Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be required from the Urban Design Commission ("Commission") for the following activities:

v.
Variances and special exceptions.
d.
Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of any historic/contributing principal building. A partial demolition of a historic/contributing principal building shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when the partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the building's historic interpretability or importance to the District.
(2)
Variances and Special Exceptions. Variances and special exceptions from the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District regulations shall be heard by the Commission. The Commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances or special exceptions from the provisions of the District when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances and special exceptions shall be as specified in Chapter 26 of the City of Atlanta Zoning Ordinance.
a.
Zoning Variances Granted Prior to Enactment of the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District (Chapter 20U). Any owner of property who obtained, on or after January 1, 1982, and prior to the effective date of the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District (Chapter 20U), a variance from the City of Atlanta Board of Zoning Adjustment to construct all, or a portion, of a project in the District, shall be entitled to construct said project according to the plans presented in that application.
(3)
Financial Hardship Exemptions.
a.
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the District. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of neighborhood revitalization and prevention of displacement of residents, the Commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
b.
The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant.
c.
The Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
i.

ii.
The age of the property owner;
iii.
The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought;
iv.
The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
v.
The costs associated with adherence to these regulations;
vi.
The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and
vii.
The purpose and intent of this Chapter.
d.
The Commission shall consider these factors. If it finds that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations it shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate.
(4)
Subdivisions, Consolidations, and Replatting of Lots. The platting pattern of the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District is an integral part of the historic character of the District. No subdivision, consolidation, or replat shall be approved by the City of Atlanta unless it can be shown through archival documentation or maps that the proposal is substantially consistent with the original platting pattern of the District. In addition to the regulations of the City of Atlanta Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances, including but not limited to Sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions, consolidations and replats of lots shall conform to the original platting pattern in the District with regard to the area of the lot, dimensions, and configurations, except contributing multifamily properties may be consolidated with other immediately adjacent contributing multifamily properties.
(5)
The Compatibility Rule. To permit flexibility and to ensure alterations to existing structures and the design of new structures are sensitive to and sympathetic toward the existing character of the District, some regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match the predominant original or historic elements of the historic/contributing buildings of like use on the same block. If there is not a predominant original or historic element on the same block, the element in question shall be consistent with the architectural style of the structure. Where quantifiable, the element in question (i.e., building height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the historic/contributing buildings of like use on the same block." Those elements that the compatibility rule applies to are specified in the District regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."
(6)
Rebuilding of Structures and Features. After a partial or complete destruction of an entire structure or any portions of a structure due to fire, tree fall damage, or other un-intentional causes, for the purposes of zoning compliance, the previously existing structure or portion of structure may be rebuilt to its previously existing exterior condition in all respects, including but not limited to height, setbacks, location, lot coverage, building components, architectural elements, and general design. If the structure or portions of a structure are not rebuilt to their previously existing exterior condition, all aspects of the new structure or new portions of an existing structure shall meet the Bonaventure-Somerset Historic District regulations and all applicable City of Atlanta Zoning regulations.
(7)
Height Calculation. The height of any structure shall be measured on the front facade from the average point of grade on the front façade to the highest point of the roof or façade, whichever is higher.
