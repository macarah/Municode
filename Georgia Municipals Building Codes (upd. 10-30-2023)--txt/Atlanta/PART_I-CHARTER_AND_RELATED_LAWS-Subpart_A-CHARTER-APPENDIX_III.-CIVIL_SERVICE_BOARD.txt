Such provisions were transferred by § 7-104(b) of the new city charter (1996 Ga. L. p. 4469) to Part 5, Chapter 2 of the city's 1973 code, which code had been replaced by the current city code when the new charter was adopted. The provisions of this appendix will be retained in this appendix until transferred to the new city code.
