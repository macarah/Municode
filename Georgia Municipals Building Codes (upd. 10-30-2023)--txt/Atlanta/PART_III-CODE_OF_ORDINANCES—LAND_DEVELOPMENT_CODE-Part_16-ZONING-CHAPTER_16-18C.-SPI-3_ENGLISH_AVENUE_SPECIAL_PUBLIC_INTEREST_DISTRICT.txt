ii.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
b.
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment in cases such as, minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations.
