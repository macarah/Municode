This code of ethics has the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials and employees;

(3)
To require disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interest in manners affecting the city; and

(a)
Preliminary review of ethics complaints:
(1)
Upon being appointed and being served with all pertinent documents, and upon expiration of the fifteen-day period for the respondent to file an answer, the hearing officer shall review the complaint and response, if any, to determine: (i) whether the complaint is in conformity with the requirements of sections 2-377 and 2-383 herein, (ii) whether upon consideration of the complaint and response, the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or (iii) whether upon consideration of the complaint and answer, the complaint demonstrates facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction as set forth in this article.
(2)
If the complaint fails based upon the requirements of subsection (1) above, the complaint shall be dismissed stating the basis for said dismissal. A dismissal of such complaint preliminarily herein shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official.
(b)
Evidentiary hearing on ethics complaints:
(1)
Upon a determination that the complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to subsection (1) above, the hearing officer shall be empowered to collect evidence and information concerning such complaint and to add the findings and results of the investigation to the file containing such complaint. In furtherance of this investigation, the hearing officer may:
(i)
Seek such further information from the complainant or the respondent through inquiry or written questions, provided, however, the respondent shall have no obligation to answer any inquiries, or
(ii)
Conduct a hearing regarding the allegations set forth in the complaint. Respondent shall have the right to representation by counsel at all stages of these proceedings, to written notice of the hearing at least ten calendar days before the first hearing, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, to not testify, and to submit evidence and call or subpoena witnesses to oppose or mitigate the allegations. In all hearings held under this section, the procedures and rules of evidence applicable in civil cases shall guide, but not strictly apply.
(2)
All investigations under this section shall be completed within 45 days of the hearing officer receiving the complaint and any response. Should the investigation not be completed in the said period, the complaint will be deemed dismissed as a failure to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council, unless an extension is requested by complainant and granted by the hearing officer. Only one such extension may be granted for an additional 30 days. Within seven days of the completion of the investigation, the hearing officer shall:
(i)
Dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or that it fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council; or
(ii)
Prepare a report of findings and recommendations to the mayor and city council.
(iii)
Should the hearing officer determine to submit a report in the matter, the report shall consist of: a written finding of facts, a determination whether the complaint establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that a violation has been committed, and, if so, the specific violation and evidence supporting the same, and a recommendation regarding the punishment for such violation.
(iv)
The hearing officer's written determination of findings and recommendations shall be delivered to the city clerk, who shall provide a copy to the city manager and the mayor and council and serve a copy on the complainant and respondent by personal service, certified mail return receipt requested, or by statutory overnight delivery.

Upon receipt of findings and recommendations from the hearing officer, the mayor and council may:
(i)
By simple majority accept the findings of the hearing officer.
(ii)
By simple majority accept the findings of fact and reject the recommended discipline, instead substituting its own discipline which shall be limited to the remedies stated herein.
(iii)
By a supermajority, consisting of the majority of those present forming a quorum plus one, reject the findings and recommendations and conduct its own hearing in conjunction with the same hearing procedures dictated above. Upon the completion of such a hearing, the findings and recommendations of the mayor and city council shall be binding.
(iv)
If no majority or supermajority can be obtained as provided herein, the findings and recommendations shall be deemed rejected and the complaint dismissed. Such dismissal shall be one on the merits.
(2)
If the subject of the complaint is the mayor or any councilmember, he or she shall recuse themselves from participation in any hearing or vote held pursuant to this subsection (c), with the exception of the right to attend such hearing as member of the general public, nor shall such mayor or councilmember be counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum.

Sec. 2-386. - Charge of noncompliance.
(a)
After the filing of an ethics complaint, but at least five days prior to the preliminary hearing, or evidentiary hearing if one is set, the respondent and/or complainant may file a charge of noncompliance with the city clerk, alleging that the complainant, respondent and/or any city employee/official has failed to meet a required deadline under this article. This section is strictly limited to grievances with respect to procedural deadlines set forth under this article, and may not be used to seek review of alleged ethics violations. Additionally, a separate charge must be filed against each city employee and/or official who is alleged to have violated a procedural deadline set forth under this article. The charge must identify the filer of the charge, the person against whom the charge is made, and the alleged missed deadline.
(b)
The city clerk, or his designee, shall email a copy of such charge to the hearing officer, city manager, respondent, complainant and the employee and/or official against whom the charge is made, within five calendar days of such filing. The city clerk shall not be required to email a copy of the charge to the respondent and/or complainant who filed the charge. The city manager shall cause for corrective action to be taken for any missed deadline under this article by a city employee.
(c)
The filer of the charge may also raise the charge of noncompliance as a threshold issue at the next scheduled public meeting on the ethics complaint. The hearing officer shall thereafter determine whether the alleged deadline was missed. The hearing officer's finding of a material failure by the complainant to comply with this article at any time may result in the ethics complaint's dismissal. The hearing officer's finding of a missed deadline by a city employee and/or official, without a finding of contributing negligence by the filer of the charge, shall give the filer of the charge the option to have the proceeding continued to the next available council meeting in lieu of being heard further that day.
