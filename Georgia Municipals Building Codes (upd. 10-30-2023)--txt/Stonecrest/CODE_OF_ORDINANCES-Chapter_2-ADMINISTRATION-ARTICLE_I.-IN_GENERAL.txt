Sec. 2-6. - City council leave of absence policy.
(a)
Any member of the city council, which includes the mayor, may declare and place him or herself on a leave of absence from public office at any time and based on any reason which, in the member's sole judgment, warrants a leave of absence. The leave of absence provided for herein shall become effective immediately upon the member delivering to the city clerk a written notification declaring the leave of absence. Such notice shall contain a brief description of the reason(s) for the leave, the date the leave is to commence, and the date the leave is expected to end. No leave of absence shall be effective if it is less than 72 hours in duration.
(b)
A leave of absence shall not require action by or acceptance from the city council in order to be effective; however, the city clerk shall notify the city council within 24 hours of receiving a notice of leave of absence. Further, the presiding officer shall inform the public of the leave of absence at the next regular meeting of the city council.
(c)
A leave of absence shall terminate on the date set forth in the notice without the necessity of further action by the member in question or action by the city council; provided however that the member may end the leave of absence sooner than the date declared in the original notice by submitting a second written notice to the city clerk setting the earlier ending date.
(d)
While a member is on a leave of absence, he or she shall be automatically excused from attending meetings of the city council, and any missed meetings shall not count towards the forfeiture of elected office under section 2.03 of the Charter.
(e)
A member shall be precluded from exercising any of the duties of their office or taking any official action whatsoever while on a leave of absence, except as provided in subsection (g) herein. Further, no city funds shall be expended by such member or on such member's behalf for costs or expenses incurred while the member is on a leave of absence or for any period during which a leave of absence was effective. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a member from receiving emails, correspondence, or other information provided to the city council.
(f)
During any period that the mayor is on a leave of absence, the mayor pro tempore shall fully assume all of the duties and powers of the office of the mayor. If both the mayor and the mayor pro tempore are on leaves of absence at the same time, then the remaining members of city council shall select a member to perform the duties of mayor pro tempore.
(g)
The sole official act that a member may take and that city staff may recognize while such member is on a leave of absence is delivering written notice to the city clerk ending the leave of absence sooner than the date set forth in the original notice.
