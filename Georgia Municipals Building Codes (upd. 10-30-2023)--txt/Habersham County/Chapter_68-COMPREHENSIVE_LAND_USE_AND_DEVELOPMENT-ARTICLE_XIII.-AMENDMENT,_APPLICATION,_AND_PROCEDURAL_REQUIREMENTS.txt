(4)
Each speaker shall be allowed five minutes to address the governing body concerning the zoning decision then under consideration unless the governing body, prior to or at the time of the reading of the proposed zoning decision, allows additional time in which to address the governing body on said proposed zoning decision.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the governing body from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on a proposed zoning decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
