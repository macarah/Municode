The health, safety and welfare of the citizens and property of Habersham County may be jeopardized during an emergency, disaster or imminent threat thereof, by the presence of looters, vandals, thieves and others who would take advantage of the confusion and devastation that accompanies such an event; and
The health, safety and welfare of the citizens and property of Habersham County may be jeopardized during an emergency, disaster or the subsequent recovery period by the inability for the local governing authority to act expediently without regard to certain formalities; and
The health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Habersham County depend upon the availability and affordability of certain essential goods, materials, services and housing; and

The local governing authority of Habersham County is authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 38-3-27(b)(2) and 38-3-28 to take actions necessary to provide for the health and safety of persons and property during periods of emergency or disaster, provided that such actions are not inconsistent with any orders, rules, or regulations promulgated by the governor or his delegatee; and
The powers and functions exercised by the local governing authority necessary to conduct the business and affairs of Habersham County during an emergency or disaster proclaimed as such by the appropriate state official may continue without the regard to compliance with time consuming procedures and formalities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-54; and
In accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 36-10-4(c)(5) and 36-4-63(6), certain formalities concerning public works contracts may be waived when necessitated by emergency; and
The Habersham County Board of Commissioners believes that it is desirable to have legislation in place authorizing the board to waive certain formalities and procedures as necessary in case of emergency, natural disaster or the subsequent recovery period; and
