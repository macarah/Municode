Has required all such facilities other than light poles and attachments to be placed underground and all such undergrounding has been completed prior to the submission of the application or, for rights-of-way where such facilities other than light poles and attachments have not been deployed, has in effect a reasonable and nondiscriminatory zoning or development ordinance or regulation that requires such facilities other than light poles and attachments to be placed underground;
(2)
Does not prohibit the replacement of light poles or the collocation of small wireless facilities in the designated area and
(3)
Permits wireless providers to seek a waiver of the underground requirements for the placement of a new pole to support small wireless facilities, which waivers shall be addressed in a nondiscriminatory manner and consistent with applicable law.
(b)
If the county adopts undergrounding requirements, those requirements shall:
(1)
Allow a wireless provider to maintain in place any previously collocated small wireless facilities subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement; or
(2)
Either allow the wireless provider to replace the pole associated with previously collocated small wireless facilities at the same location or propose an alternate location within 50 feet of the prior location, which the wireless provider shall use unless such alternate location imposes technical limits or significant additional costs.

Sec. 68-1629. - Processing of applications that are subject to administrative review.
(a)
An applicant may submit a single consolidated application provided that such a consolidated application shall be for a geographic area no more than two miles in diameter and must comply with this article. The denial of one or more small wireless facilities or poles in a consolidated application shall not delay the processing of any other small wireless facilities or poles in the same application. The county may issue a single or multiple permits for the small wireless facilities and poles in a consolidated application.
(b)
For Class II Authorities as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-66(C) "Streamlining Wireless Facilities and Antennas Act":
(1)
A consolidated application for the placement of new poles and the collocation of one or more small wireless facilities on such new poles may include no more than five poles and any associated small wireless facilities. While an applicant has applications, including consolidated applications, pending before the county for review of 15 or more new poles and the collocation of associated small wireless facilities, the county may, but shall not be required to, toll the processing requirements under this article for any application subsequently submitted by the same applicant for the placement of new poles and the collocation of associated small wireless facilities; and
(2)
A consolidated application for the collocation of small wireless facilities on existing poles or support structures may include no more than 15 sites. While an applicant has applications, including consolidated applications, pending before the county for review of 45 or more sites for the collocation of small wireless facilities on existing poles or support structures, the county may toll the processing requirements under this article for any application subsequently submitted by the same applicant for the collocation of small wireless facilities on existing poles or support structures.
(c)
For purposes of subsection 68-1629(b) of this article:
(1)
Small wireless facilities and poles that a wireless services provider applicant has requested a third-party to deploy and that are included in a pending application by the third-party shall be counted as pending requests by the wireless services provider applicant; and
(2)
When the processing of an application is tolled under subsection 68-1629(b) of this article, it is no longer counted as pending. As processing of applications is completed, the county will begin processing previously tolled applications in the order they were submitted, unless the applicant specifies a different order.

Sec. 68-1631. - Services unrelated to collocation.
Absent an agreement to the contrary that is made public and that is available for adoption upon the same terms and conditions to any requesting wireless provider, the county shall not require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the collocation for which approval is sought, such as in-kind contributions to the county, including reserving fiber, conduit or space on a utility pole or a wireless support structure for the county and the county may not require an applicant to transfer small wireless facilities, poles, decorative poles or support structures to the county, provided that the county may require transfer of a county pole replaced by the applicant to accommodate its collocation.

(a)
The county shall not require a wireless provider to indemnify and hold the county and its officers and employees harmless against any claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses or fees arising from the wireless provider's activities in the public right-of-way under this Article, except when a court of competent jurisdiction has found that the negligence of the wireless provider while conducting such activities caused the harm that resulted in such claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses or fees or to require a wireless provider to obtain insurance naming the county or its officers and employees an additional insured against any of the foregoing.
(b)
In no event shall the county or any officer, employee or agent affiliated therewith, while in the performance of its or his or her official duties, be liable for any claim related to the siting, installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, relocation, permitting or location of wireless equipment, facilities, poles or infrastructure including, but not limited to, any claim for destruction, damage, business interruption or signal interference with other communications service providers wherein such siting, installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, relocation, permitting or location was undertaken in substantial compliance with this article.
