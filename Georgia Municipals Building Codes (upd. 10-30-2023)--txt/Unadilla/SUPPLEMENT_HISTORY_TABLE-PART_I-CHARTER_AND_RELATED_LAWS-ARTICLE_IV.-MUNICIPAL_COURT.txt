The Municipal Court may fix punishment for offenses, within its jurisdiction not exceeding a fine of five hundred dollars or imprisonment for sixty days, or both. As an alternative to fine or imprisonment, the Municipal Court may sentence any offender upon conviction to labor in a City work gang or on the streets, sidewalks, squares or other public works for a period not exceeding sixty days.

The Municipal Court shall have authority to establish a schedule of fees to defray the costs of operation and shall be entitled to reimbursement of the costs of meals, transportation and caretaking of prisoners bound over to Superior Courts for violations of State law.

The Municipal Court shall have authority to establish bail and recognizances to insure the presence of those charged with violations before said court and shall have discretionary authority to accept cash or personal or real property as surety for appearance of persons charged with violations. Whenever any person shall give bail for his appearance and shall fail to appear at the time fixed for trial, his bond shall be forfeited by the Judge presiding at such time and an execution issued thereon by serving the defendant and his sureties with a rule nisi at least two days before a hearing on the rule nisi. In the event that cash or property is accepted in lieu of bond for security for the appearance of a defendant at trial and if such defendant fails to appear at the time and place fixed for trial, the cash so deposited shall on order of the Judge be forfeited to the City or the property so deposited shall have a lien against it for the value forfeited, which lien shall be enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a lien for City property taxes.

The Municipal Court shall have authority to bind prisoners over to the appropriate court when it appears by probable cause that a State law has been violated.

Section 4.14. - Appeal.
(a)
A right of appeal to the Mayor and Council from the decision or judgment of the Municipal Court shall exist when the fine imposed upon the defendant is greater than one hundred dollars or the punishment is for a longer time than thirty days' imprisonment or thirty days of labor to the City. The right of said appeal must be exercised, in writing, to the Mayor and Council, within five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the judgment of the Municipal Court. The failure to exercise the right of appeal, as provided herein, shall not be construed as denying the right of appeal provided for in subsection (b) hereof.
(b)
The right of appeal shall exist in all cases from the judgment of the Municipal Court to the Superior Court of Dooly County in the same manner and under the same procedure as generally prescribed for appeals and appeal bonds from the Probate Court; provided, however, that any person who fails to file his appeal to the Superior Court in either of the above cases within thirty days of the date of his conviction in the Municipal Court shall be deemed to have waived any such right. An appeal to the Superior Court shall be a de novo proceeding.
Section 4.15. - Rules for court.
With the approval of the Council, the Judge shall have full power and authority to make reasonable rules and regulations necessary and proper to secure the efficient and successful administration of the Municipal Court; provided, however, that the Council may adopt in part or in toto the rules and regulations relative to the procedure of the operation of the Superior Court under the general laws of the State of Georgia. The rules and regulations made or adopted for said Court may be filed with the City Clerk and shall be available for public inspection upon request.
