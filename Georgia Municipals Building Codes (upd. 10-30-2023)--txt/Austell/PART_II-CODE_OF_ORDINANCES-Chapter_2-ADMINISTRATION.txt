(1)
Postpone the purchase until the next fiscal year;

Identify a source from within the department budget to cover a shortfall; or
(3)
Suggest an appropriate budget amendment.
Resubmitting the documentation with a different accounting code is not permitted.

Purchases between $3,000.00 and $25,000.00. The department head, together with the mayor, shall authorize purchases between $3,000.00 and $25,000.00.

Purchases over $25,000.00. Any purchase in excess of $25,000.00 shall be subject to the following:

Must be based on standard specifications that allow maximum competition among qualified vendors whose products or services meet established performance requirements.
(3)
Such purchases shall require formal competitive sealed bids, which shall be advertised in the state procurement registry pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-80-26; provided, however, any public works construction contract governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22 shall be advertised both in the state procurement registry and in the county newspaper of general circulation at least once no less than one week prior to the date at the time of public bid opening, in accordance with state law. In addition, the city shall make other reasonable efforts to make qualified vendors aware of the purchasing opportunity, including direct notification of potential vendors in the geographical area of the city.

Sec. 2-277. - Emergency purchases.
(a)
A bona fide emergency is a situation that seriously jeopardizes public safety, health or welfare or that otherwise adversely affects the ability of a city department to utilize normal purchasing channels.

After determination that an emergency situation or condition exists, the department head shall make the purchase and obtain a receipt therefor. No later than the first working day after the purchase is consummated, the department head shall prepare and submit to the finance director a confirmation letter explaining the nature of the emergency. The letter shall be accompanied by the purchase receipt and any related documentation. The finance director shall report the emergency purchase to the mayor and city council no later than the next regularly scheduled council meeting following receipt of the confirmation letter and supporting documentation.
Sec. 2-278. - Local vendor preference.

For purposes of this section, a local vendor is a vendor maintaining a physical presence within the city limits including at a minimum the maintenance of at least one office and continuous employment of at least two persons within the city limits for not less than six months prior to the submission of a bid.
(2)
For purchases or contracts under $100,000.00, where a local vendor's bid meets all specifications and is within five percent of the lowest responsive and responsible non-local bidder, the city is authorized to negotiate with local vendors to match the lowest bid submitted by a non-local vendor. The lowest bidding local vendor shall be given one business day from the opening of bids to notify the department head or other designated city official that it will match the low bid submitted by the non-local vendor.
(3)
If the local vendor refuses to match the low bid, then the next lowest local vendor within five percent, if any, shall be given one business day to agree to match the low bid submitted by the non-local vendor, and so on until all local vendors have had an opportunity to match the low bid.
(b)
To be eligible for consideration under this section, bids submitted by local vendors must meet all other terms and conditions of the bid and must be otherwise qualified to be awarded city contracts. The exercise of local vendor preference shall not be at the sacrifice of the quality of the purchased product or service.
(c)
Local vendor preference shall not apply to road construction or public works projects otherwise governed by state law or to the purchase of goods or services for which preference is prohibited by state law.
(d)
The local vendor preference shall be stated in written solicitations for bids unless the preference is not applicable pursuant to this section.
