(a)
It is unlawful for any person or entity to conduct a flea market business or for any flea market promoter, operator or owner to operate, or allow to be operated, such a business or for any flea market vendor to display or sell wares of any kind at a flea market without a business license issued by the city.
(b)
Business licenses issued for a flea market or to any flea market promoter, operator or owner shall be valid only for the licensed location. Business licenses issued for a flea market vendor shall be valid when the vendor is operating from any duly licensed flea market in the city.
(c)
It is unlawful for any flea market promoter, owner, operator or agent providing or renting space for flea market vendors, to rent any sales area to any vendor or to provide space free of rent or to allow any vendor to use any sales area within a flea market unless the vendor has a valid business license from the city. It shall be the duty of the flea market promoter, operator, owner or agent renting or providing space, to issue to each vendor a license on forms to be provided by the city and to verify that such license is in effect for each vendor. Failure to verify that each vendor has a valid business license, or the renting or provision of space for any unlicensed vendor to display or sell wares shall subject the business license of the flea market operator, owner or promoter to revocation.
(d)
All persons desiring to obtain a business license as a vendor or for a flea market as a flea market promoter, operator, or owner shall make written application to the city on forms to be prepared and approved by the city. Applicants shall supply such reasonable information as may be required by the city.

An applicant, by filing an application, agrees to produce for oral interrogatories any person under the applicant's supervision or control who might have information pertinent to the application, upon the request of the city to do so. Failure to furnish such information or produce persons within 30 days of the request shall automatically serve to dismiss the application.

(1)
The applicant has had any license issued under the police powers of any county or other governmental entity previously suspended or revoked.

The term "conviction" includes an adjudication of guilt or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the forfeiture of a bond when charged with a crime. Where the violation is for a misdemeanor, forfeiture of bond, violation of a municipal or county ordinance or where there is a plea of nolo contendere, the city council may, after investigation, if appealed by the applicant, waive the same as a disqualification.
