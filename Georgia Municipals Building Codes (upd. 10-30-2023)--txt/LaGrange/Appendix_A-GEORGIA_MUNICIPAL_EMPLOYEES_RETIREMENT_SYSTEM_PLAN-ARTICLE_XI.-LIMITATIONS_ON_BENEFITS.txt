ARTICLE XI. - LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS

Section 11.01. - Effective Date.
The Plan shall be administered so as to comply with this Article for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, except as otherwise provided herein.
Section 11.02. - Limitation on Annual Benefit.
(a)
In no event shall the aggregate annual benefit for a calendar year (the "limitation year") provided under this Plan and all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether the plan has terminated) of the Employer for any Participant exceed an amount equal to One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) as adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d)(1)(A).
(b)
Adjustment for Benefits Commencing Before Age 62.
(1)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the retirement income benefit commencement date (expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the retirement income benefit commencement date).
(2)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the lesser of the limitation determined under paragraph (1) and the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this Article.
(3)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year that begins on or after January 1, 2002, but prior to July 1, 2007, the determination as to whether the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limitation has been satisfied shall be made by reducing the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limitation so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). The age reduced dollar limit shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the actuarial table in Section 12.01 of the Plan for actuarial equivalence for early retirement benefits, and the amount computed using five percent (5%) interest and the applicable mortality table (to the extent that the mortality decrement is used prior to age sixty-two (62)).
(c)
Adjustment for Benefits Commencing After Age 65.
(1)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that retirement income benefit commencement date as defined in Section 2.02 of the Plan (expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the retirement income benefit commencement date).
(2)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the lesser of the limitation determined under paragraph (1) and the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this Article. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the Participant, computed disregarding the Participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical Participant who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the Participant.
(3)
If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year that begins on or after January 1, 2002, but prior to July 1, 2007, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (i) the actuarial increase factors specified in Section 12.06 of the Plan; or (ii) a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in Section 2.02 of the Plan.
(d)
Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, in adjusting the dollar limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date under subsection (b) or (c), as applicable, no adjustment shall be made to the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation to reflect the probability of a Participant's death between the retirement income benefit commencement date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the retirement income benefit commencement date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant prior to the retirement income benefit commencement. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the retirement income benefit commencement date, such an adjustment shall be made. Furthermore, notwithstanding the requirements of this section, the adjustments provided for in subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply (i) in the event the Participant's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of service as a full-time employee of any police or fire department or on fifteen (15) years of military service, or (ii) in the case of pre-retirement disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits.
(e)
Adjustment for Form Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). For distributions made in any form other than a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply [a monthly benefit], such benefit shall be adjusted to a straight life annuity, beginning at the same age, which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit.
(1)
For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity for purposes of applying the limitations under Code Section 415(b) to benefits is equal to the greater of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "lesser of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions):
(A)
The equivalent annual benefit computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in Article XII of the Plan for actuarial equivalence for the particular form of benefit payable, and
(B)
The equivalent annual benefit computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003 or Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003).
(2)
For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "lesser of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions):
(A)
The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Participant under the Plan commencing at the same retirement income benefit commencement date as the Participant's form of benefit; and
(B)
The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant's form of benefit, computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008).
(f)
Adjustment for Form Not Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). As required by final Treasury Regulations, for distributions made in any form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) applies [a lump sum benefit], such benefit shall be adjusted to a straight life annuity, beginning at the same age, which is the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit which is the greatest of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "least of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions):
(1)
The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in Article XII of the Plan for actuarial experience;
(2)
The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and five-tenths percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003, Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008); or
(3)
The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the 30-year Treasury rate prior to January 1, 2008, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2008, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003, Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008), divided by one and five-one-hundredths (1.05).
(g)
Limitations on benefits under this Article shall not apply where the total annual benefits payable to a Participant under this Plan and all other qualified defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) of the Employer do not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) in the aggregate. This minimum limitation is not applicable for a Participant whose Employer maintains or has maintained a defined contribution plan in which such Participant participated.
(h)
The Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) minimum limitation, if provided, must be reduced where a Participant has less than ten (10) years of service with the Employer at the time the Participant begins to receive retirement benefits under the Plan, and the maximum dollar limitation must be reduced where a Participant has less than ten (10) years of participation when retirement benefits under the Plan commence. These adjustments are made by multiplying the applicable limitations by the appropriate fraction:
(A)
For the Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) minimum limitation — Years of service with the employer as of and including, the current limitation year divided by ten (10); or
(B)
For the maximum dollar limitation — Years of participation with the employer as of and including, the current limitation year divided by ten (10).
(i)
For purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (Limit), the following will apply:
(1)
Prior to any limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, adjustments under Section 6.05, will be taken into consideration when determining a Participant's applicable Limit;
(2)
For any limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007:
(A)
A Participant's applicable Limit will be applied to the Participant's annual benefit in the Participant's first limitation year without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments under Section 6.05;
(B)
To the extent the Participant's benefit equals or exceeds the Limit, the Participant will no longer be eligible for cost of living adjustments under Section 6.05 until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated adjustments under Section 6.05 are less than the Limit;
(C)
Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a Participant's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases under Section 6.05, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit Limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but
(D)
In no event shall a Participant's benefit payable under the Plan in any limitation year be greater than the Limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. If the form of benefit without regard to the automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the preceding provisions are applied by reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit.
Section 11.03. - Limitation on Annual Additions.
(a)
Effective beginning on and after January 1, 2002, to the extent required under Code Section 415(c), in no event shall the "annual addition" for a Participant for any calendar year (the "limitation year"), exceed the lesser of:
(1)
Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000)), as adjusted for increases in the cost of living under Code Section 415(d); or
(2)
One hundred percent (100%)) of the "compensation" of such Participant received from an Adopting Employer during the limitation year.
(b)
For purposes of this Section, "compensation" means all of a Participant's wages as defined in Code Section 3401(a) for the purposes of income tax withholding at the source but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)); provided, however, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation shall also include the amount of any elective deferrals, as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3), and any amount contributed or deferred by the Adopting Employer at the election of the Employee and which is not includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code Section 125 or 457, but shall exclude Employee contributions picked up under Code Section 414(h)(2). For limitations years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation shall also include any amount deferred by the Adopting Employer at the election of the Employee which is not includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the following types of payments, if paid by the later of (i) two and one-half (2 1/2) months following a Participant's Termination of Employment, or (ii) the last day of the limitation year that includes the Participant's Termination of Employment, will be included as compensation for purposes of this Section: payments that, absent a Termination of Employment, would have been paid to the Participant while he or she continued in employment and that are regular compensation for services rendered, and payments of accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued. Any payments not described in the preceding sentence are not considered compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are paid within two and one-half (2 1/2) months following severance from employment, except for payments to the individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service. An Employee who is in qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) shall be treated as receiving compensation from the Employer during such period of qualified military service equal to (i) the compensation the Employee would have received during such period if the Employee were not in qualified military service, determined based on the rate of pay the Employee would have received from the Employer but for the absence during the period of qualified military service, or (ii) if the compensation the Employee would have received during such period was not reasonably certain, the Employee's average compensation from the Employer during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the qualified military service (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding the qualified military service). For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a Participant's compensation for purposes of this Section shall not exceed the annual limit under Code Section 401(a)(17).
(c)
For purposes of this Section, "annual addition" means the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant's accounts for the limitation year under this Plan and any other plan maintained by an Employer: (i) employer contributions; (ii) employee contributions; (iii) forfeitures; and (iv) allocations under a simplified employee pension plan. Amounts allocated after March 31, 1984, to an individual medical account, as defined in Code Section 415(1)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by an Employer are treated as annual additions to a defined contribution plan. Also, amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending after such date, which are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to the separate account of a key employee, as defined in Code Section 419A(d)(3), under a welfare benefit fund, as defined in Code Section 419(e), maintained by an Employer are treated as an annual additions to a defined contribution plan.
(d)
If the annual addition for a Participant under the Plan would be greater than the annual addition for such Participant as limited by subsection (a), then the excess shall be corrected as permitted under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (currently set forth in Revenue Procedure 2008-50).
Section 11.04. - Code Section 415(e) Limits.
For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2000, any benefit limitations applied pursuant to Code Section 415(e) shall no longer apply for employees or former employees who are Participants with an accrued benefit under the Plan on or after January 1, 2000.
Section 11.05. - Limitations on Service Credit Purchases.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if an Adopting Employer adopts an Addendum to the Adoption Agreement that provides for service credit purchases, the Administrator may modify a request by a Participant to make an Employee Contribution if the amount of the Contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods:
(1)
If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the Administrator may establish a periodic payment plan for the Participant to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n).
(2)
If payment pursuant to paragraph (1) will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the Administrator may either reduce the Employee Contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the Participant's Contribution.
(b)
Effective for any permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a Participant makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under an Adopting Employer's Plan, then the requirements of this Section will be treated as met only if:
(1)
The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such Contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or
(2)
The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such Contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c),
(3)
For purposes of applying paragraph (1), the Plan will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this paragraph (3), and for purposes of applying paragraph (2), the Plan will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) solely by reason of this subsection (b),
(4)
For purposes of this subsection (b) the term "permissive service credit" means service credit:
(A)
Recognized by the Plan for purposes of calculating a Participant's benefit under the Plan,
(B)
Which such Participant has not received under the Plan, and
(C)
Which such Participant may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the Plan, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit.
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subparagraph (B), may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a Participant is receiving under the Plan.
(5)
The Plan will fail to meet the requirements of this subsection (b) if;
(A)
More than five (5) years of nonqualified service credit are taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (5), or
(B)
Any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this subsection (b) before the Participant has at least five (5) years of participation under the Plan.
(6)
For purposes of paragraph (5), effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, the term "nonqualified service credit" means permissive service credit other than that allowed with respect to;
(A)
Service (including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave) as an employee of the Government of the United States, any State or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than military service or service for credit which was obtained as a result of a repayment described in Code Section 415(k)(3)),
(B)
Service (including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave) as an employee (other than as an employee described in subparagraph (A)) of an education organization described in Code Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) which is a public, private, or sectarian school which provides elementary or secondary education (through grade 12), or a comparable level of education, as determined under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the service was performed,
(C)
Service as an employee of an association of employees who are described in subparagraph (A), or
(D)
Military service (other than qualified military service under Code Section 414(u)) recognized by such governmental plan.
In the case of service described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), such service will be nonqualified service if recognition of such service would cause a Participant to receive a retirement benefit for the same service under more than one Plan.
(7)
In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31, 2001, to which Code Section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) applies (without regard to whether the transfer is made between plans maintained by the same employer)—
(A)
The limitations of paragraph (6) will not apply in determining whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit, and
(B)
The distribution rules applicable under federal law to the Plan will apply to such amounts and any benefits attributable to such amounts.
(8)
For an eligible Participant, the limitation of Code Section 415(c)(1) shall not be applied to reduce the amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under the terms of the Plan as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of this paragraph (8), an eligible Participant is an individual who first became a Participant in the Plan before January 1, 1998.
Section 11.06. - Interpretation of this Article.
(a)
The annual additions and annual benefit of a Participant shall be adjusted pursuant to this Article so as to produce the maximum annual benefit and maximum annual additions permissible for such Participant.
(b)
For purposes of this Section and subject to Code Section 415(h), all defined benefit plans of an Adopting Employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans of an Adopting Employer are to be treated as a single defined contribution plan. However, Adopting Employers shall be considered as separate Employers in accordance with State law.
