From April through November, the structure shall either be shaded or moved out of direct sunlight. If the shelter is made of wood, it shall be raised at least two (2) inches off the ground to prevent seepage or rotting. Examples of inadequate shelter include, but are not limited to, lean-tos, metal or plastic drums, boxes, abandoned vehicles, porches, decks, or material that does not provide sufficient protection from the elements.
