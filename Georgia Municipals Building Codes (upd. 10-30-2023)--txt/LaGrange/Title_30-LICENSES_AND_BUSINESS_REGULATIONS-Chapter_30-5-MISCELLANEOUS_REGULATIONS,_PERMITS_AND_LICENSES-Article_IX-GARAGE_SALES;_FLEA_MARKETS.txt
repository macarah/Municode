The unregulated allowance of garage sales in the city presents an opportunity for abuse in that some persons may be conducting business activities under the guise of having a garage sale.

The existence of nonregulated and recurring garage sales causes annoyance to citizens in residential areas in the city and congestion of the streets thereof.

This article is adopted for the purpose of prohibiting the infringement of business activities in established residential areas by regulating the term and frequency of garage sales so as to prevent the disturbance or disruption of the residential environment throughout the city.

This article is not intended to prohibit or control isolated or casual sales by individuals of household or other personal items.

The provisions and prohibitions contained in this article are adopted not for the purpose of preventing but for the purpose of regulating the garage sales in the city for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
