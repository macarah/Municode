(1)
Ignitability, which identifies wastes that pose a fire hazard during routine management;
(2)
Corrosivity, which identifies wastes requiring special containers because of their ability to corrode standard materials or requiring segregation from other wastes because of their ability to dissolve toxic contaminants;
(3)
Reactivity or explosiveness, which identifies wastes that, during routine management, tend to react spontaneously, to react vigorously with air to water, to be unstable to shock or heat, to generate toxic gases, or to explode; and
(4)
Toxicity, which identifies wastes that, when improperly managed, may release toxicants in sufficient quantities to pose a substantial hazard to human health or to the environment.

Sec. 15-10-24. - Residential garbage collection service levels; container location.
Three (3) levels of service for the collection of residential solid waste are provided by the city:
(1)
Curbside garbage collection: By 6:30 a.m. on the scheduled day for collection, customers place their container on the street shoulder in front of their residence. Containers should be placed approximately four feet from the edge of the roadway, but not so as to pose a physical or visual obstruction to motorists. Where there is insufficient right-of-way adjacent to the roadway, or other topographical difficulties exist which make it unreasonable to conform to the general requirements, customers should place their container at a location mutually agreeable to the customer and solid waste division, after consultation with the solid waste superintendent or his designee. All containers shall be removed from the curbside and returned to the customer's residence no later than 8:00 a.m. on the day following the day of service.
(2)
Assisted service for households with mobility-impaired residents: Households in which all regular residents are mobility-impaired may apply for assisted collection service at the same fee as levied for curbside collection. City personnel will enter upon the customer's property to collect their solid waste from city-issued container(s) on the scheduled day of collection.
(3)
Premium service: City personnel will enter upon a customer's property to collect their solid waste from city-issued container(s) on the scheduled day of collection if the customer subscribes to this service level.
For households subscribing to "premium" service or for those households with mobility-impaired residents, the city-issued container(s) shall be placed so that the collector shall not be required to go more than twenty (20) feet beyond the edge of the driveway, preferably visible from the street. Containers located on private property shall not be serviced until clear access is provided to both the collection vehicle and the path the collector must travel to access container. No containers should be located within garages, carports, basements, breezeways, fenced enclosures or otherwise in the vicinity of articles not considered to be waste by the resident. Collectors shall not be required to collect solid waste from any premises where an animal considered to be vicious is maintained without restraint. If it is not practical to place the container(s) for collection at the location above specified, the solid waste superintendent shall designate the location of the container(s). The owner, his agent or occupant of any residential property, shall release the city from any claim of damage of any kind or nature that may result to the premises or persons located thereon, or for any other claim of damages that may result in the servicing of the residential property because of the entry upon private property.

Every owner, occupant, tenant, or lessee of a house or building used for residential, business, commercial or other purposes, is required to maintain responsibility and surveillance over the solid waste receptacles on his/her premises. For households subscribing to curbside garbage collection, it is the owner or occupants responsibility to insure that the container(s) is (are) located on the curb by 6:30 a.m. on the regularly scheduled collection day. For households subscribing to "premium" service, it is the owner or occupants responsibility to insure that the container(s) is (are) located within twenty (20) feet of the driveway by 6:30 a.m. on the regularly scheduled day of collection. City solid waste collectors shall not be responsible for picking up loose and scattered solid waste resulting from improper containerization or lack of maintenance of the generator's solid waste storage area.

(1)
Debris shall not extend over the sidewalk so as to block pedestrian traffic or fall into or extend over the street so as to hinder vehicular traffic or make it difficult to use motor-driven sweepers.
(2)
Debris shall not be placed in the gutter, in any ditch or other path of storm water runoff.
(3)
