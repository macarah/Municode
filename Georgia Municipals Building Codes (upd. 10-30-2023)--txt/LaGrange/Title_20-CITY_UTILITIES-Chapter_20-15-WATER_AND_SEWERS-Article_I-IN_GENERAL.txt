Sec. 20-15-2. - Water service permit; application.
All applications for the use of water shall be made in writing on forms furnished by the city. Forms shall be specifically and properly filled in and signed personally by the owner of the premises to be served.

Sec. 20-15-3. - Meters.
(a)
Generally. Water meters approved by the city shall be attached to all premises where city water is used, unless the city shall otherwise direct. All such meters shall be the property of the city and shall be installed according to the requirements of this chapter, or as provided by the rules of the city. After the installation of the first meter, the city shall keep it in repair and replace it with a new one when necessary, except where it has been damaged by hot water from within the premises or by some malicious act. In such case, the cost of repairs on account of such hot water or malicious act shall be charged to the owner or tenant. Upon failure of any owner or tenant served by a meter so damaged to pay, within thirty (30) days from the date of the bill for the cost of such repairs, the water shall be shut off and service discontinued until such bill has been paid.
(b)
Separate, when required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a separate water meter shall be required for each living unit, living quarters or place of business to which water is supplied by the city; except that a duplex, apartment complex, trailer park or other combination of living units may use one (1) master water meter for the purpose of measuring the water used by all of the individual living units combined, provided the property owner shall assume the responsibility of payment for all water and wastewater charges. For any customer who so uses a master water meter, the monthly bill for said water or wastewater service shall be calculated by the city as follows:
(1)
The metered consumption shall be divided by the total number of living units to determine average consumption;
(2)
Average charges shall be calculated using the average consumption and appropriate rate schedule; and
(3)
Total charges shall be calculated by multiplying the average charges by the total number of living units. The total number of living units is defined as all of the living units and service connections downstream of the master meter regardless of actual occupancy.
(c)
Receiving water through another's meter. Whenever water service has been shut off for any reason, and it is found that the occupants are using water through another meter or service, the city may transfer charges against them to the meter through which it is found the property is being served; and if such bill or charge is not paid, the city shall shut off and discontinue water from all meters serving such property until such bill is paid in full.
(d)
Obstructing or concealing. No person shall obstruct, cover up or conceal any water meter so that the city employees cannot find or reach such meter.

No person shall turn water off or on from any city water service, unless such person has the permission of the city.
(c)
Changes in pipes or fixtures. It shall be unlawful for any person to make any changes in water pipes or fixtures, either by extending such pipes to other premises, or within the premises to which water is supplied, which will in any way effect a change in the water rates, without first securing a permit from the city, specifying the nature of the change to be made, such as the number of fixtures, connections and the like. As soon as the work has been executed, such person shall make an immediate report to the city of all such work done by him.

It shall be unlawful for any person to take or use water from any fireplug, hydrant, valve, pipe, other device or fixture, opening or connection of the system, or to open any plug, hydrant, valve, pipe or other fixture for the purpose of taking or using water, unless such person shall have permission from the city, or is an employee of the city and is acting on the discharge of his duty as such. No person to whom a permit is issued for the use of water for any purpose whatever, including construction purposes, irrigating, testing, flushing and the like, shall use or consent to the use of water not authorized by permit from the city.

(f)
Wasting water. If it is found that there is a waste of water in or about any premises to which water is supplied from the system, either by willful waste or by means of a leak in any water pipe or fixture located in or upon such premises, the city may cause the water to be cut off from such premises upon twenty-four-hours' notice to the occupant, unless such waste shall be immediately stopped. Where the water supply is cut off as provided in this subsection, the water shall not be turned on until the cause of the waste is remedied and all water bills and the bill for the cost of cutting off and again turning on the water shall have been paid.
