The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the customer and/or owner of the land, the period for which the fees were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the fees due, including costs accrued thereon. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date and manner of notice delivery or mailing, and the place and party to which the notice was delivered or mailed. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk.
(d)
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner provided as that for executions and judicial sales; however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten (10) days written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the customer and/or property owner at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to the property's sale and such claim or lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service, or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e)
For four (4) weeks, in the official legal organ of the city, the marshal shall publish a weekly advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted. This advertisement shall also include a full and complete description of the property to be sold, and the known names of the customers and/or owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state that the property is being sold for collection of fees due to the City of Union City and the period of time for which said fees accrued which gave rise to the execution for satisfaction.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal, before the county courthouse, on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. However, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. As to the title and soundness of all property sold under fee executions, the purchaser bears all risks. Neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, express or implied.
(g)
The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sale price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who purchases any property sold at said sale shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money regardless of purchaser failure or refusal to comply with the terms of sale upon request by the marshal. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. Upon a sale for fees conducted pursuant to this ordinance, the deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered by the marshal shall convey title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of property shall be final. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property sold pursuant to this ordinance.
(h)
If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no bids are forthcoming on property sold for fees, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and held out for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 5, 2-18-03)
Sec. 15-209. - Bidding by city at sale, disposition of property acquired.
(a)
If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale of property for fees makes a bid for the property being sold that is high enough to equal or exceed the total of fees due plus the marshal's cost of the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for fees may be divested or alienated by the city only pursuant to a public sale of the property to the highest bidder.

He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for fees, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid and the final disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying fees, costs, and expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized by this ordinance to receive the excess.
(b)
If, within ninety (90) days from the date an execution is placed in his possession, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city utilities clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of the execution on the general execution docket of the county at the time of final payment or collection upon said execution.
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 7, 2-18-03)
Sec. 15-211. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment.
(a)
Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any fee execution in his possession, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his possession belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
(b)
When an execution for fees remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately proceeding thirty (30) day period and the city utilities clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state of Georgia, the city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may petition the Superior Court of the county in Georgia in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in Georgia, the action may be brought in the county where the fee obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
(Ord. No. 2003-01, § 8, 2-18-03)

The user shall service each separator frequently and repair as necessary, to ensure that the effluent discharge does not exceed allowable limits set forth herein. The user shall maintain records of said service and make available to the designated city representative.
(b)
It shall be a violation of this Code to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances, which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils, and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the city sewer line, pump station, or treatment plant. Use of any other substances, including enzymes and special bacteria is solely at the discretion of the user. Prior to the use of any biological products, the user shall inform the city in writing of their intent to add such products to their pretreatment system.
(c)
The city shall have the authority to prohibit the addition of any substance, including enzymes and bacteria used for maintenance of a grease trap if it is discovered that said substance causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of the publicly-owned treatment works, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential hazard to personnel.
(d)
If upon inspection, it is determined that a grease trap is in need of cleaning, the only acceptable means shall be to pump out the grease for disposal. Applying heavy doses of chemicals, enzymes, or bacteria to the grease trap will not be allowed as a substitute for pumping and removing the material from the trap.
(e)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions to enzymes, special bacteria, or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable grease trap.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § 4, 10-15-19)
Sec. 15-218. - Permits.
(a)
Construction permit. No portion of a pretreatment system shall be installed, repaired, altered, modified, or replaced until a pretreatment construction permit has been issued by the city. A fee will be required for review of plans. Permits issued for new construction shall become void eighteen (18) months after the date of issuance if the system has not been installed. However, if building construction has commenced, the system construction permit shall be valid for an additional ninety (90) calendar days beyond the eighteen-month expiration date. Permits for system repairs shall become void after ninety (90) calendar days from the date of issuance. A construction or repair permit for a pretreatment system shall be transferred to another person if the transferee files an amended application providing all corrected information and proof of ownership of the property or tenant occupancy within sixty (60) calendar days after the transfer of ownership, and all information pertaining to the siting, location, and installation conditions or repair of a pretreatment system remains the same. There is no fee associated with the processing of the transfer. The date of the construction or repair permit shall not be amended, but shall run from the date of original issuance prior to the transfer.
(b)
Construction revision permit. The applicant shall be the permit holder and shall be held responsible for all information supplied to the city. The signed application, site evaluation, and system design plans when required, serve as the basis by which the city determines the issuance of a construction permit. In the event of a change in any information given in the application which served as basis for issuing a construction permit, the permit holder will immediately file an amended application detailing such changed conditions. If the new conditions are determined to be in compliance with the city's engineering standards, the construction permit shall be amended. If the new conditions are determined to be in noncompliance with the city's engineering standards, the permit shall no longer be valid.
(c)
Commercial waste permit. A permit shall be required by any commercial waste generator discharging to the city's sanitary sewer and publicly-owned treatment works. The permit will be valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance and is not transferable. The permit must be placed in a conspicuous location. If the owner of a pretreatment system remains the same but the ownership of the building changes, a site tenant is still operating within the permit guidelines. No new building tenant shall open for business until the city has approved the change of tenancy and inspected the pretreatment system to see if it is still within the guidelines of the original operating permit.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § 5, 10-15-19)
Sec. 15-219. - Pretreatment inspections.
(a)
New construction. Before covering with earth and before placing a pretreatment system into service, a person/company installing or constructing any portion of a pretreatment system shall notify the city prior to completion of the construction activities and shall have the system inspected by the city for compliance with the requirements herein. A final inspection fee will be required. The city shall make every reasonable effort to make a complete inspection of system construction, modification, replacement, or alteration within two (2) working days after notification that the system is ready for inspection. A repair shall be inspected by the city to determine compliance with construction permit standards prior to final covering of the system. If the system constructed is approved by the city, an "inspection approval" notice will be given to the installer. If the system installation does not pass the construction inspection, then the installer shall make all required corrections and notify the city within seven (7) calendar days for a reinspection of the system. A reinspection fee shall be charged to the installer for additional inspection(s) if the contractor has failed to correct the items an inspector has required at the preliminary inspection. Final installation approval shall not be granted until the city has confirmed that the installation is in compliance with plans and specifications submitted with the permit application. If no final construction inspection can be documented of the commercial waste generators pretreatment system, then the certificate of occupancy on the project will not be released.
(b)
Existing pretreatment systems. The city will perform an annual inspection of all pretreatment systems permitted to operate in the city. The inspections will be conducted to make sure the commercial waste generator is following the maintenance criteria set forth herein and the waste generator is operating under the conditions of the permit. Those facilities found in non-compliance will be required to correct all violations within seven (7) calendar days of notification. However, if the violation requires a repair, replacement, or installation of a pretreatment system, then the commercial waste generator will have forty-five (45) calendar days to comply. All repairs, replacement, and installations will require approval by the city.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § 6, 10-15-19)
Sec. 15-220. - Location and installation.
(a)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed closest to the discharge source of the commercial waste. A subsurface pretreatment system must be located or installed no more than fifty (50) feet from the discharge source. A subsurface pretreatment system installed beyond fifty (50) feet must have approval by the city.
(b)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed so that proper maintenance of the system does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and does not impact the environment.
(c)
Pretreatment systems must be located and installed so that they are accessible for maintenance. No heavy kitchen equipment, canisters, dumpsters, or trash compactors can block access to the pretreatment system.
(d)
Interior grease traps will be installed at the point source such as a 3-4 compartment sink, dishwasher, or any kitchen equipment where grease must be collected prior to discharge to the building waste line. Interior grease traps will be located above the floor. Recessed grease traps must have prior approval for installation. All interior grease traps must have a flow control valve and a vent. The flow control valve shall be placed on the inlet side of the grease trap. The vent line will take all odors out of the building.
(e)
Pretreatment systems installed and located so as to experience a rusting of parts (e.g., pretreatment system located under a kitchen sink), will require the commercial waste generator to provide access to the system. If the commercial waste generator cannot provide access, then they will be in violation. The inspector can require that the unit be replaced if it has deteriorated from corrosion.
(f)
Pretreatment systems installed and located on the outside of a building will discharge to the sanitary sewer line. The test manhole is the last discharge point of the pretreatment system before the sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer connection from the pretreatment system will not be allowed to connect to the site sanitary sewer line by going under or through the building. The connection to the sanitary sewer line must be kept to the exterior of the building structure. The connection from the building to the pretreatment system will be a direct straight line. One (1) ninety- or forty-five-degree angle will be allowed with a clean out if a straight line is not obtainable. The test manhole will be located a maximum of four (4) feet from the last tank in the pretreatment system and must have an invert in the test manhole. Prefab concrete or brick construction is allowed.
(g)
All pretreatment systems installed subsurface in multi-level parking decks must be located on the ground level of the structure and must be located so they are accessible for maintenance and inspection.
(h)
Installation of an alternative interior pretreatment system will be allowed for commercial waste generators where an upgrade, repair, or installation of a pretreatment system is required and a subsurface system is not possible. However, the commercial waste generator must meet the following criteria for an alternative pretreatment system to be installed:
(1)
The facility must be located in an existing building structure that is fifteen (15) years old or older, where written documentation is submitted by a licensed engineer, contractor, or master plumber to verify a subsurface pretreatment system is impossible to install due to existing underground utilities; and
(2)
The facility is not located in new commercial development; and
(3)
Written documentation is provided by a licensed engineer, contractor, or master plumber that the sanitary sewer tie-in of a subsurface pretreatment system cannot be reached by the installer; and
(4)
The facility's pretreatment system is found to be inadequate and an alternative system will upgrade the current pretreatment system to bring the facility into compliance.
(i)
Any subsurface pretreatment system requiring installation of more than one (1) single tank will lace the tanks in tandem and in one (1) single line. The multiple tanks must be installed so the commercial waste from the building will flow from tank to tank. The distance from tank to tank will not be greater than twelve (12) inches.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § 7, 10-15-19)
Sec. 15-221. - Design of pretreatment system.
Oil water separators, grease traps, and sand traps will be required for commercial and industrial establishments as a pretreatment system where it is determined by the city that they are necessary to prevent oil and grease waste discharge to the sanitary sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the sewer system and the city's publicly-owned treatment works. The user shall submit plans to the city for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the city's inspection prior to placing in service.
(a)
Subsurface pretreatment systems shall comply with the structural requirements as indicated herein. All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well as the current plumbing code used by the city.
(b)
For the sizing of pretreatment systems by specific generators, refer to generator source charts herein. Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be:
(1)
Inadequate for the facility's current operation;
(2)
In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals that an upgrade or repair is required;
(3)
Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the city, or clean-up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair; or
(4)
Installed incorrectly and not per the plumbing code or engineering standards utilized by the city. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced.
(c)
Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system. The concrete lid of the tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two (2) feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled.
(d)
Any three-thousand-gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two (2) sections provided the center section has been sealed properly so that no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be three thousand (3,000) gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All three-thousand-gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two (2) manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or their equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two (2) sections if the tank is less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as baffle wall. A three-inch to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two (2) feet from the bottom of the tank.
(e)
A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system.
(f)
Each installed subsurface pretreatment system must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification and the gallon per minute (GPM) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify the type and size of the tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed.
(g)
All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four (4) feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two (2) feet. The brick work will be three (3) feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once eighty (80) percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, the user must corbel in the brickwork in small increments.
(h)
An alternate interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the city. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the city for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required.
(i)
A grease trap is used for the collection of kitchen waste discharge only. It cannot be used to collect discharge from can wash areas, dumpsters, mop sinks, food grinders, food coolers, or floor drains in mechanical rooms or bathrooms. Commercial waste generators that have micro-brewery facilities may be subject to additional discharge requirements.
(j)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria, or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable pretreatment system.
(k)
It shall be unlawful to introduce chemicals and/or acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils, and grease to the extent that such material later solidifies in the city sewer lines or pump stations or in the publicly-owned treatment works. If a commercial waste generator uses enzymes and bacteria for pretreatment maintenance and it is discovered that said substances cause damage to or interfere with the operation or maintenance of the publicly-owned treatment works, create a public nuisance or odor, or present a potential health hazard, then these additives will be prohibited. Use of any other substances, including special enzymes and bacteria is solely at the discretion of the commercial waste generator.
(l)
Grit and sand traps and oil water separators shall be installed in accordance to the current official plumbing code used by the city's engineering standards.
(m)
Any strip retail shopping center or office building showing subsurface pretreatment systems at designated buildings or structures will only be allowed discharge by a single tenant or food service to that system. No multiple users will be allowed. The only exception to this condition is a shopping mall with a food court where pretreatment systems are installed and maintained by the mall corporation or management leasing.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § 8, 10-15-19)
Sec. 15-222. - Maintenance of pretreatment systems.
(a)
Pretreatment systems shall be maintained by the commercial waste generator at its expense, to assure continually efficient operation at all times.
