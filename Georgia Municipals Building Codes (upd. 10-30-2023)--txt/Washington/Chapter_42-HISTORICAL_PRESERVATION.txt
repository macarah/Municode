The city may approve or reject the determination made by the commission or remand with instructions, if the mayor and council find the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. An abuse of discretion exists where the record presented to the mayor and council shows that the decision made by the commission was arbitrary, capricious, or clearly unreasonable. Appeals from decisions of the mayor and council may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for city or county ordinance violations.
