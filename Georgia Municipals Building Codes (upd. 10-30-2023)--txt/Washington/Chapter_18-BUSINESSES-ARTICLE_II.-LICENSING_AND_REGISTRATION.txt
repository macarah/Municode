All other proceedings in relation thereof shall be as provided by this Code, the Charter and the laws of the state.

If, at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full, together with all interest penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges for services and goods due the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the tax.
