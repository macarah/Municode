DIVISION 2. - NONCONFORMING USES

Sec. 90-676. - Purpose.
It is the intent of this division to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights; however, this chapter recognizes that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety, and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses which would violate the purpose, intent, and provisions of this chapter. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land or structure may be continued and maintained except as otherwise provided in this division.
(Ord. of 6-2-1997, § 19-111; Ord. of 8-11-2008(4), § II)
Sec. 90-677. - Alteration or enlargement of buildings or structures.
A nonconforming building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the building or structure, including additions, conforms to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. However, if a building or structure is conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to setback, height, or off-street parking requirements, the building may be enlarged or added to, provided that the enlargement or addition complies with all the requirements of the district in which the building is located. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on the lot unless every portion of the building is made to conform to all the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. of 6-2-1997, § 19-112)
Sec. 90-678. - Discontinuance of nonconforming uses.

(Ord. of 6-2-1997, § 19-113)
Sec. 90-679. - Damage to nonconforming uses.
Any nonconforming building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or other causes, to the extent of 75 percent of its fair market value, shall not be repaired or reconstructed except where such building or structure and the use thereof shall conform to all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage equates to less than 75 percent of fair market value, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless authority is granted in conformity with this chapter and all other applicable sections of Washington City Code, and repairs are begun within one year after the date of such damage and are diligently pursued to completion.
(Ord. of 6-2-1997, § 19-114; Ord. of 8-11-2008(4), § III)
Sec. 90-680. - Nonconforming accessory uses.
No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
(Ord; of 8-11-2008(4), § IV)
Sec. 90-681. - Termination of nonconforming use for nuisance or illegality.
The right to continue a nonconforming use is conditional and may be continued for only so long as the nonconforming activity is conducted lawfully and does not produce a condition which constitutes a nuisance. The use of any building, structure or land in a manner set forth within this section shall constitute abandonment of the nonconforming use, shall equate to immediate termination of the nonconforming use, and nothing contained in section 90-678 shall be construed to require such a condition to continue for a period of one year. Actions constituting abandonment and immediate termination of a nonconforming use shall include:
(1)
Use in a manner which produces a condition constituting any type of nuisance established in chapters 38 or 46 of the Washington City Code.
(2)
Use for any activity which is in violation of law or ordinance.

Solar farms shall adhere to the requirements of the district in which they are located, including but not limited to setbacks, height, lot area coverage requirements and buffer requirements.
a.
Where a solar farm is located on a major street, solar plant structures must be located a minimum of 100 feet from the right-of-way.
b.
A solar farm with solar panels within 100 feet of any street must have sufficient barriers to prevent a passenger vehicle leaving that street at the maximum speed limit from entering the solar field. A "passenger vehicle" means every motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less.
(5)
The following requirements shall be met for permit applications:
a.
A descriptive plot plan including setbacks, panel sizes, locations of property lines, buildings, and road right-of-ways.
b.
The plan shall include a fire suppression system sufficient to prevent a fire from spreading off the site.
c.
No solar farm shall be installed until evidence has been given to the city that the electric utility company has been informed of the customer's intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator. Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
d.
An affidavit or evidence of agreement between lot owner and the facility's owner or operator confirming that the owner or operator has permission of the property owner to apply for necessary permits for construction and operation of the urban solar farm.
e.
Proof of notification to the managing authority of any airport located within five miles of the proposed location.
f.
Any other relevant studies, reports, certificates and approvals as may be reasonably requested by the city, including but not limited to design review.
(6)
The following requirements shall be met for decommissioning solar farms:
a.
Each applicant for a permit must submit decommissioning plans that describe the anticipated life of the solar project, the party responsible for decommissioning, the estimated decommissioning costs in current dollars, and the method for ensuring by bond that funds will be available for decommissioning and restoration.
b.
Preferred bond instruments shall include cash or surety from a bonding company with authority to operate in the State of Georgia and approved by the city. The bond shall consist of three components for purposes of determining its amount. The first component will address environmental liabilities including hazardous materials liabilities, such as risks associated with hazardous waste and hazardous substances. The second component will address the decommissioning, removal, and proper disposal, as appropriate, of improvements and facilities. The third component will address reclamation, re-vegetation, restoration, and soil stabilization. There shall be a single instrument to cover all potential liabilities. The entire bond amount may be used to address a single risk event such as hazardous materials release or groundwater contamination regardless of the fact that in calculating the total bond amount other risks were also considered. If the bond is used to address a particular risk, the holder would then be required to increase the bond amount to compensate for this use.
c.
Solar farms which have not been in active and continuous service for a period of one year shall be removed at the owner's or operator's expense.
d.
The site shall be restored to as natural condition as possible within six months of the removal.
e.
A site will be considered decommissioned when, after inspection and approval by the city, all structures and equipment are removed and the site is re-vegetated.
