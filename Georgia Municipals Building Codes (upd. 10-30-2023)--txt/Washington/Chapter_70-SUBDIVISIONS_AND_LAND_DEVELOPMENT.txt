The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Land development or development includes a project involving the construction of streets, utilities, buildings, or other improvements required for the habitation or use of property, such as a subdivision, a residential neighborhood, an apartment complex, a store, a shopping center, employment centers, and other similar examples; and, any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or permanent storage of materials; and, the act of carrying out a land development project, including the alteration of land or vegetation in preparation for construction activity.
Land subdivision or subdivision includes all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development and includes all divisions of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets and includes re-subdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards set forth in this chapter.
(2)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved.
Multi-use trail means an element of the active transportation network which accommodates principally non-motorized transportation options such as walking, cycling, skating, jogging, etc. Multi-use trails are an element of the off-street transportation network that can be utilized for travel and for recreational purposes and are typically not located within a public or private street right-of-way.
Public improvement means the construction, enlargement, extension, provision or other construction of a facility intended for dedication to the city.
Publicly dedicated means land or improvements that has or have been, or will be, transferred by plat and/or deeded to and accepted by the city for public use and maintenance.

Sec. 70-71. - Character district street general parameters.
Subdivisions located partially or entirely within a character zoning district as established in chapter 90 of this Code and requiring the construction of a new street shall adhere to the applicable street design standards contained within this section. The mayor and council may also require the application of the character district street design standards contained within this section to streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code.
(1)
Established. This section establishes the following two character district street types:
a.
AVENUE.
b.
STREET.
(2)
Purpose. Character district streets are designed in a manner that equally accommodates the needs of motorized and non-motorized traffic including pedestrian, bicycle and automobile travelers. Design elements within character district streets provide an aesthetically pleasing gateway to Washington's various districts and neighborhoods, while balancing the standard need to convey persons to a destination with the use of the street right-of-way as a public space intended for multiple activities.
(3)
Relationship to functional classification system. Character district streets are designed to facilitate safe and effective traffic flow and access to property consistent with the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) functional classification guidelines. Conversely, character area street design requirements also promote the compact and pedestrian-oriented context of Washington's existing neighborhoods and future planned development patterns. To balance these varied goals, the use of character district street types will relate to applicable FHWA functional classifications for small urban areas and Washington's conventional street types as provided in Figure 70-71-A:

The conventional street design requirements contained in section 70-70 may be utilized where a character district street type is otherwise required but does not exist to meet the performance requirements of the FHWA's functional classification guidelines as presented in Figure 70-71-A, and as determined by the mayor and council. Where a design specification for a character district street is not provided for a provision related to grade, curvature, tangents, etc., the applicable provisions contained in section 70-70 shall be utilized.
(4)
Specifications. Character district street type design specifications for STREET and AVENUE are located within sections 70-72 and 70-73, respectively. The specifications for each character district street address the following:
a.
Intent. Identifies the purpose and function for which each character district street type is utilized.
b.
Context. Establishes the general criteria under which varying character district street sub-types may be utilized and constructed.
c.
Design components. Establishes the basic dimensional standards for each character district street type and street sub-type.
d.
Streetscape elements. Provides additional information and options regarding the application of the design components to a street segment.
(Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-72. - Character district street type (STREET).
The application of STREETs as a component of a land development's character district street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section.
(1)
Intent. A STREET serves as a walkable low-speed local thoroughfare primarily serving abutting property. A STREET is designed to link residential neighborhoods, and to connect neighborhoods with commercial and other land use districts. STREET design balances vehicular access to abutting property with pedestrian movement and comfort. General STREETs are intended to serve primarily residential areas, but may support limited commercial activity at intersecting AVENUEs or other higher order thoroughfares where vehicular access to the commercial activity does not encourage increased traffic volumes through residential areas. Urban STREETs serve traditional commercial centers and contemporary high-density mixed-use districts, extend limited distances, and emphasize pedestrian comfort.
(2)
STREET by type and context. The type of STREET to be utilized as part of a land development's character district street system shall adhere to the appropriate context and function as provided in figure 70-72-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council.
STREETs as represented in figure 70-72-A shall function in one of the following two manners:
a.
Slow-flow. Narrow travel lanes, parked vehicles and other design specifications serve to limit the speed of motor vehicles to promote orderly traffic flow which is harmonious with surrounding districts and suitable to encourage the use of other modes of transportation.
b.
Yield-flow. Travel lanes are shared between users approaching from opposite directions—Requiring some traffic to stop and yield in the presence of parked vehicles.
(3)
Design. STREETs are subject to the applicable design components provided in figure 70-72-B, and applicable streetscape elements provided in figure 70-72-C.
(4)
Applicability. STREETs to be utilized as a component of a land development's character district street system must conform to the applicable zoning districts established by chapter 90 of City Code. STREETs are eligible street types within the following zoning districts:
a.
Base zoning districts: N/A.
b.
Character zoning districts: CD-1 (Rusher Street Revitalization District).
The mayor and council may also require the use of a STREET type for one or more streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code.
In selecting the type of character district STREET segment which should be constructed within a land development, the developer must consult with the building official to ensure that their selection is consistent with the parameters of this section and chapter.

Sec. 70-73. - Character district street type (AVENUE).
The application of AVENUEs as a component of a land development's character district street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section.
(1)
Intent. An AVENUE is a walkable low to moderate speed thoroughfare serving abutting property and accommodating local trips by connecting neighborhood streets with a community's primary internal destinations and principal arterial system. Alternatively serving the function of a collector or minor arterial thoroughfare, an AVENUE balances motor vehicle flow with access to adjacent parcels and the needs of non-motorized users. AVENUEs may be located within residential areas but also serve as the primary street type of central business districts, dense mixed use areas and other areas intended to be developed in a traditional manner. AVENUEs also serve as the principal component in the community's on-street bicycle system.
(2)
AVENUE by type and context. The type of AVENUE to be utilized as part of a land development's character district street system shall adhere to the appropriate context and function as provided in figure 70-73-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council.
AVENUEs as represented in figure 70-73-A shall function in one of the following two manners:
a.
Free-flow. Travel lanes for traffic moving in opposite directions are clearly distinguishable and marked allowing for comfortable motor vehicle travel limiting instances where drivers must share space with opposing traffic or parked vehicles.
b.
Slow-flow. Narrow travel lanes, parked vehicles and other design specifications serve to limit the speed of motor vehicles in an effort to promote orderly traffic flow which is harmonious with surrounding districts and suitable to encourage the use of other modes of transportation.
(3)
Design. AVENUEs are subject to the applicable design components provided in figure 70-73-B, and applicable streetscape elements provided in figure 70-73-C.
(4)
Applicability. AVENUEs to be utilized as a component of a land development's character district street system must conform to the applicable zoning districts established by chapter 90 of the City Code. AVENUEs are eligible street types within the following zoning districts:
a.
Base zoning districts: N/A.
b.
Character zoning districts: CD-1 (Rusher Street Revitalization District).
The mayor and council may also require the use of an AVENUE type for one or more streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code.
In selecting the type of character district AVENUE segment which should be constructed within a land development, the developer must consult with the building official to ensure that their selection is consistent with the parameters of this section and chapter. The mayor and city council reserve the final authority in determining if a proposed AVENUE adheres to the context and function for which it is to be applied.

Sec. 70-74. - Alleys.
The application of alleys as a component of a land development's street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section.
(1)
Intent. An alley serves as a low speed and low traffic volume access lane primarily serving abutting property. An alley is designed to provide rear access to properties as well as allow space for services to be located. Alleys are not thoroughfares and should not be utilized as through-ways between two points. They are always intended to function in conjunction with adjacent streets and serve as an origination or termination point of all motor vehicle trips except for a small number of service vehicles. Alleys are required to be used in conjunction with certain character district streets, but are encouraged when any character district street type is being constructed.
(2)
Applicability. Alleys will be utilized as a component of a land development under the following scenarios:
a.
Alleys shall be required by the mayor and city council where subdivision lot widths within a block average 60 feet or less and the parcels front on a major street; except, that alleys shall always be required where such blocks and lots are within or bordering a character zoning district established in chapter 90 of City Code.
b.
Alleys shall be required by the mayor and city council where necessary to meet the design criteria for the construction of a character district street.
c.
Alleys may be required by the mayor and city council in conjunction with a subdivision proposed for property within a character zoning district, or within or bordering the Washington Historic District established by chapter 42 of this Code.
d.
Alleys may be required by the mayor and city council at the rear of multi-purpose or commercial developments.
e.
Where not otherwise listed herein, the mayor and city council may approve the use of an alley in conjunction with any other type of land development so long as it is determined that the alley will serve the applicable intent and context established in this section.
(3)
Alley by type and context. The type of alley to be utilized as part of a land development shall adhere to the appropriate context as provided in figure 70-74-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council.
(4)
Alley design components. The basic design components for each of the three alley types identified in subsection 70-74(c) is provided in figure 70-74-B. Those design components listed within the figure represent the City of Washington's minimum design standards for alleys and should not be interpreted by the developer or subdivider as representing all improvements that may be required of the city within alleys and/or alley rights-of-way during the review of applicable plans and plats; nor, those construction or road section standards which may be adopted by the city independent of this chapter.

Sec. 70-75. - Street system requirements.
All conventional and character district streets within the City of Washington shall be designed and platted in a manner that compliments the existing street system. New streets shall enhance traffic flow by maximizing interconnectivity within developments, and to adjacent properties and streets; shall respect the context of existing and future planned land uses and development patterns; and, shall promote design characteristics that allow streets to be safely used in a shared manner by motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. To that end, all streets shall adhere to the street system configuration standards contained in this section.
(1)
Street intersections. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing intersecting streets.
a.
Offset of intersection. Intersections shall be arranged so that planned or existing streets on opposing sides of a road, street or thoroughfare are aligned, unless prohibited by topographic conditions. All other street intersections shall be separated by at least 150 feet, measured from centerline to centerline. The mayor and council may require a greater separation of intersections where the functional classification of intersecting streets necessitates a larger offset.
b.
Angle of intersection. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees) unless prohibited by topographic conditions; except, that no street intersection be less than 75 degrees.
The provisions of this subsection are illustrated in Figures 70-75-A and 70-75-B.

Dead-end streets. Streets shall be carried to the property line. Dead-end streets shall not be greater in length than 500 feet, except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet.
(3)
Continuation of streets.
a.
Existing streets. Existing streets and rights-of-way that project to the boundary of a tract being subdivided or otherwise developed shall be continued at the same or greater width; except, where the new subdivision is utilizing character district streets that serve the same function as the street to be extended. In such cases, a transition to the dimensions of the character district street to be utilized may be permitted.
b.
Proposed streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of internal streets to existing and adjoining streets unless prohibited by topographic conditions. Internal streets shall also be continued to the property line where adjacent tracts are susceptible to future subdivision. Segments of internal streets lying between the property line and the first internal intersection within the proposed subdivision, and that serve as a continuation of an existing and adjoining character district street, shall be designed to the applicable character district street standard.
The provisions of this subsection are illustrated in figure 70-75-C.
Figure 70-75-C: Continuation of Streets
(4)
Streets for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or land development plan proposes a subdivision or other type of land development on only a portion of a parent tract, a sketch plan of a future street system for that portion not slated for immediate development may be required by the mayor and city council.
(5)
Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the mayor and council. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets.
(Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-76. - Block requirements.
In a subdivision, block lengths and widths shall be as follows:
(1)
Length. Blocks shall be not greater than 1,200 feet or less than 600 feet in length; except where character district streets are being utilized, in which case blocks shall not exceed 800 feet or less than 200 feet in length with an average block length within a development of not more than 600 feet.
(2)
Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets, limited access highways or railroads, or where other situations make this requirement impracticable.
(3)
Conformance with character zoning districts. Where the dimensional requirements of this section conflict with the standards of a character zoning district as established in chapter 90 of this Code, the character district requirements shall apply.
(Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A))

Where a greenway, linear park corridor, or multi-use trail corridor identified in the Washington Multi-Use Trails Plan, or subsequent and overriding plans adopted by the mayor and council, is to be located within a land development or subdivision, or on an adjacent parcel, the mayor and council may require the developer or subdivider to provide pedestrian access to the planned or existing trail in the following instances and as illustrated in figure 70-83-B:
(1)
Where the multi-use trail does not yet exist within the corridor, and a funding source for the construction of such trail has not yet been identified, the developer or subdivider may be required to provide the necessary right-of-way or public pedestrian access easement to accommodate a future walkway between the street right-of-way and the multi-use trail easement in accordance with the standards established in subsection 70-83(d).
(2)
Where the multi-use trail exists or has an identified funding source for construction within the corridor, the developer or subdivider may also be required to provide a walkway between the street right-of-way and the multi-use trail in accordance with the standards established in subsection 70-83(d).
(3)
The mayor and council may require additional walkways and/or the necessary walkway right-of-way or public pedestrian access easements connecting street rights-of-way within a subdivision to each other, or to a proposed or existing multi-use trail, where the layout or size of such subdivision or development does not provide sufficient access between the trail and all subdivision lots.
