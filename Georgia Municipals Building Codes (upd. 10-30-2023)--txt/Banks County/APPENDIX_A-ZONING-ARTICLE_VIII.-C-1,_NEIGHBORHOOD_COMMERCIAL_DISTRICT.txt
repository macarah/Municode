Section 801. - Purpose and intent.
The C-1, Neighborhood Commercial District is intended to provide areas for limited small-scale commercial uses of a convenience nature serving nearby neighborhoods as opposed to a regional market. The district is not intended to accommodate automotive or other types of more intensive commercial activities that are of such magnitude or type that would result in the generation of excessive traffic, noise, odors, pollution, safety hazards, other nuisances, or other adverse impacts which would detract from the desirability of properties in the area of residential use. In general, the neighborhood commercial district includes offices and retail and service establishments but exclude those highway-oriented uses which involve the use of chemicals or outside sales, storage or display. All structures within the C-1 District shall meet the design standards as stated in Article XVIII of Appendix A pertaining to the Zoning Regulations of the Code of Banks County, Georgia. Hours of operation for businesses within the C-1 District shall be no greater than 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. No building or structure allowed as a permitted use in Section 802, Article VIII, Appendix A of the Code of Banks County, Georgia, shall exceed 2,500 square feet with outdoor storage yards not to exceed 5,000 square feet.
