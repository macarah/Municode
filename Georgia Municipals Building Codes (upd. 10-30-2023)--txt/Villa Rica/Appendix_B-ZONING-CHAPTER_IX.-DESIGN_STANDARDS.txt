Buildings constructed of metal shall be permitted only in the Single-Family Agricultural (AG) and Industrial, Medium-Density (I2) districts.
(1)
Buildings that do not exceed fifty (50%) percent metal shall be permitted in the Industrial, Low-Density (I1) and Commercial, Medium-Density (C2) zoning districts, and must contain other design elements such as concrete or masonry bases, pitched roofs, enhanced entries or color variation.
ii)
Structures shall be constructed using a minimum of fifty (50%) percent masonry as described below.
(1)
Masonry construction may consist of brick, granite, sandstone, slate, limestone, marble, or other hard and durable all-weather stone. Ashlar, cut stone, and dimension stone construction techniques are acceptable.
(2)
Brick material used for masonry construction shall be composed of hard-fired all-weather standard size brick or other all-weather facing brick.
(3)
Concrete finish or precast concrete panels shall be textured using the following techniques: exposed aggregate, bush-hammered, sand-blasted, or other concrete finish as approved by the Director or his/her duly appointed designee. Concrete masonry units (CMU or block) shall be textured or split-face, and otherwise not smooth.
(4)
Office uses may use: Architectural metal panels, glass (up to 75% of the facade area) and ornamental metal.
e)
Roof Design . The materials and finishes for roofs shall complement those materials used for the exterior walls. Roofs may be pitched, use stepped parapet walls, three dimensional cornices, dimensioned or integrally-textured materials, or be sloped with overhangs and brackets. Parapets shall not exceed more than one-third (1/3) the height of the supporting wall (above the floor of which they are located).
f)
Four-sided Architecture . The architectural style, materials, color and design on the front elevation shall be applied to all elevations of the structure adjacent to a public street, primary internal drive or residential zoning district.
i)
Blank, windowless walls are prohibited along facades enfronting a public way, except where a building enfronts multiple streets. In the latter case, it was not historically uncommon for buildings (especially commercial or mixed-use ones) to orient towards the more intensely developed street. As such, along the first story of enfronting mixed-use and commercial facades this requirement may be waived by the Director along streets that are predominantly residential in character when:
(1)
The first twenty (20) feet of said facade meets the above requirements, and
(2)
The area beyond the first twenty (20) feet is treated with architectural detailing, such as pilasters, false windows, or similar features.
g)
Color . Compatible materials and colors should be used throughout to unify development. The colors should reflect natural tones of the environment and be subtle, harmonious and non-reflective. Accents shall be compatible.
h)
Entry Features . Entryway features are only required at the primary entrance to the structure and shall include elements such as: covered entries, integral planters, awnings, raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms having an average slope greater than or equal to a minimum 5:12 pitch, arches, or architectural details such as tile work and moldings that are integrated into the building structure and design.
[8)]
MAINTENANCE. The exposed walls and roofs of buildings shall be maintained in a clean, orderly, and attractive condition, and be free of cracks, dents, punctures, breakage, and other forms of visible marring. Materials that become excessively faded, chalked, or otherwise deteriorated shall be refinished, repainted, or replaced.
a)
Refuse and waste removal areas, loading berths, service yards, storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be screened from view with fencing, walls or landscaping.
b)
All accessory buildings and structures shall be constructed with materials that are similar and compatible with materials used in the principal structure.
[9)]
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT SCREENING AND PLACEMENT.
a)
Roof-mounted equipment on exposed roofs shall be completely screened from view. The appearance of roof screens shall be coordinated with the building to maintain a unified appearance.
b)
All ground- and building-mounted mechanical and electrical equipment shall be screened from view. The screens and enclosures shall be treated as an integral element of the building's appearance. Landscaping may be used for this purpose.
c)
Ground-mounted, commercial-grade mechanical equipment such as walk-in freezers.
i)
Design. The unit shall be screened by a masonry wall that complements the architecture of the primary structure. Walls attached to the primary structure shall be designed as an architecturally integrated part of the primary structure. The wall shall be sufficient to dampen any noise generated while the unit is in operation.
ii)
Height. The wall shall be equal to the height of the unit plus two (2) feet.
iii)
Access. The enclosure shall be accessed via an opaque gate.
iv)
Orientation. The gate shall not face a residential property, or a right-of-way within fifty (50) feet.
v)
Setback. All mechanical equipment shall be located a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the property line, and shall not be located within a front or side setback.
d)
Utility substations shall be screened with a fence that is at least fifty (50%) percent opaque and at least eight (8) feet in height, and the exterior wall of the fence shall be landscaped with a Type 1 Buffer yard comprised solely of evergreen species.
i)
The fence may not be chain-link.
[10)]
SIGN STANDARDS. Signage shall be designed to be an integral part of the architectural and landscaping plans. The colors, materials, and style of signage shall be architecturally compatible and accentuate the buildings and landscaping on the site. The colors, materials, and lighting of every sign shall be restrained and harmonious with the building and site to which it principally relates. Signs shall be in conformance with theVilla Rica Sign Ordinance.
[11)]
LANDSCAPE PLAN. Landscaping shall be in conformance with Section 7.05 - Landscaping Standards. Plans shall be prepared and submitted with the Development Plan.
a)
Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate, existing trees should be conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan; credit toward required in-kind landscaping may be given.
[12)]
SITE AMENITIES. Site amenities provide attractive spaces and the possibility of interaction. Site amenities such as patios, plazas, mini-parks, squares, water features and public art should be incorporated in the required open space for the development.
[13)]
LIGHTING. Lighting shall be in conformance with Section 7.12- Outdoor Lighting.
[14)]
OPERATIONAL COMPATIBILITY WITH SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT. The Planning & Zoning Commission may impose conditions on the approval of a project including but not limited to:
a)
the placement of trash receptacles;
b)
location of delivery and loading zones;
c)
hours of refuse removal; and
d)
hours of sign illumination.
[15)]
MODIFICATION. The Planning & Zoning Commission shall have the authority to modify any of the requirements of this Section in accordance with Subsection 2.02(9)(a) ix.
(Amd. of 7-12-2022 ; Amd. of 10-4-2022 )
Sec. 9.05. - Community design considerations.
1)
INTERIOR RUMBLE STRIPS. Rumble strips should be installed adjacent to raised medians or other interior curbs to draw attention to the presence of the median during adverse weather conditions or other circumstances where visibility is low. Rumble strips should be designed so that adverse riding conditions are not created for on-street cyclists.
2)
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET LIGHTING. Lights should be installed along neighborhood streets. They should be no taller than twenty (20) feet and should be fully shielded or full cutoff fixtures.
3)
STREET ADDRESSES. Business and residence address lettering should be a minimum height of six (6) inches, should take into consideration the contrast of lettering and background colors, and should be externally illuminated.
4)
STREET ELEMENTS. The community should work with GDOT to encourage increased pavement markings standards, brighter stop lights, and larger and/or easily readable letters for street names/street signs.
5)
STREET WIDTH. Street width and right-of-way easement requirements should take into consideration the necessary width of roadways through low-traffic, residential neighborhoods. Large road widths can interrupt the benefits of high-density neighborhoods and the safety of pedestrians who cross the street.
6)
TRANSPORTATION. Safe and nearby pedestrian walkways/trailways, bikeways, and public transit should be created to increase a residence's visitability and aid in transportation accessibility for individuals without motor vehicle access.
