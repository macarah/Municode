Sec. 8-224. - Standards for nonconventional on-site sewage management systems.
(a)
Equivalency standards. The department shall review absorption field products that differ in design from the conventional on-site sewage management system. The following standards will be used to determine equivalency to the conventional on-site sewage management system:
(1)
The design infiltrative surface is the wetted trench bottom area.
(2)
Due to the combined effects of compaction, contact area and fines associated with gravel aggregate, the effective infiltrative surface area is reduced by an estimated 50 percent.
(3)
The minimum amount of effective trench bottom infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
(4)
Sidewall area shall not be considered for design reduction. The minimum amount of effective sidewall infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
(5)
The minimum storage volume required for a system shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
(6)
The design absorption area required is based on the most hydraulically limiting soil horizon that comes into contact with the infiltrative surface of the sidewall, trench bottom and for a distance one foot below the absorption trench bottom.
Infiltration area for conventional 36-inch wide gravel trench absorption
EXPAND
Sidewall Infiltration Area: 2 sq. ft./ft x 0.50 = 1 sq. ft./linear foot
Trench Bottom Infiltration Area: 3 sq. ft./ft. x 0.50 = 1.5 sq. ft./linear foot
Storage Volume: 3 cubic feet/linear foot x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot x .35 = 7.85 gallons/linear foot
  (b)
Prior approval. Lots approved for development based on a reduction in absorption trench length up to 50 percent shall continue to be approved and permitted for up to a 50 percent reduction in absorption trench length provided the lot is part of a recorded plat or part of a preliminary development plan submitted to the county board of health within one year of rule adoption. Preliminary plans must include, as a minimum, proposed lots and streets with lot identifications, lot dimensions and square footage; a topographic map with watercourses and floodplain identified; a level three soil report; the location of the water supply system, rights-of-way, easements and utilities; and the name, registration number and seal of the professional surveyor or engineer.
