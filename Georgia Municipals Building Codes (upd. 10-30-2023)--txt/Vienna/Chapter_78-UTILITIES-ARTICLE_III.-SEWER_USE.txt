DIVISION 11. - NOTICE TO COMPLY LETTERS, NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS, FINES AND SCHEDULES

Sec. 78-142. - Notice to comply (NTC), notice of violation (NOV), fines/assessments and surcharges.
new
(a)
Notice to comply (NTC), notice of violation (NOV) and ASSESSMENTS. If the city administrator or his/her designee determines that the user is not meeting the requirements set forth in the sewer use ordinance, he/she shall immediately issue to the owner/operator of the establishment a certified notice to comply (NTC) or notice of violation (NOV). NTCs will be issued for minor violations that whereas NOVs will be issued for significant permit violations. The notice shall include a description of the any deficiencies, including but not limited to:
(1)
Failure to follow the permit monitoring schedule;
(2)
Failure to report changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(3)
Failure to properly maintain the interconnections and interceptor as applicable;
(4)
Failure to maintain logs, files, records, or access for inspection or monitoring activities;
(5)
Failure to obtain or renew the discharge permit in a timely manner;
(6)
Failure to properly maintain storage areas and equipment resulting in release of potential illicit discharges to the municipal separate stormwater system (MS4) or nearby streams; or
(7)
Any other violations of these regulations or state law that requires correction by the user establishment.
The enforcement action shall also include an immediate course of action the user shall be required to take to come into compliance including payment of surcharges for pollutants discharged above permit limits. If the user establishment has not complied with the terms of the initial enforcement action, a second enforcement action will be issued along with an assessment (not less than $1,000.00 per occurrence) with each day being a separate assessment and payment of surcharges for pollutants discharged above permit limits. If the establishment does not comply with the terms of the second enforcement action, a third enforcement action and an assessment (not less than $1,000.00 per occurrence) with each day being a separate assessment and payment of surcharges for pollutants discharged above permit limits will be issued along with additional actions including a show cause hearing, issuance of a compliance schedule and/or withholding of utility services. A discharge to the wastewater system above permit limits or failure to follow the wastewater slug discharge control plan constitutes an immediate NOV. Issuances of three or more NOVs within a six-month period will result in the issuance of an assessment with each subsequent NOV within the same period.
(b)
Surcharge fees are calculated based on the pounds of pollutant discharged to each LAS. The amounts are listed below:
EXPAND
SURCHARGE FEES
LAS#1 LAS#2
Average cost per pound per day to treat wastewater $0.76 $0.75
Average cost per thousand gallon per day to treat wastewater $2.52 $2.09
  (c)
Under emergency conditions with written approval from the city administrator or his/her designee, a limited portion of the discharge from Tysons may be diverted to LAS#1, Old Americus Road, Vienna, GA 31092. This may occur only after a meter is installed at Tyson's expense to measure flow to this treatment facility. Monitoring of the discharge of all required constituents by Tysons is required every day in which flow is diverted to LAS#1. Failure to monitor can result in a cessation of future use of LAS#1. An additional assessment of not less than $1,000.00 shall be incurred for each day any flow is discharged to LAS#1. Surcharges for pollutants discharged will also be assessed along with the daily use fee. The amount of the surcharge will be based on monitoring data provided by Tyson and/or the city (at the city's discretion). No discharge above permit limits shall be allowed. If this occurs, the daily use fee and surcharges will be doubled for each day permit limits are exceeded. Payment of all fees is due within 45 days of invoice. Failure to provide payment will incur additional penalties. Should the city choose to test the diversion system to ensure its integrity, it will do so only on days when Tysons actively monitors its discharge. Surcharges for flow/pollutants discharged during the test will not be assessed provided the monitoring results indicate LAS#1 permit limits for Tysons are being met. Should the monitoring results indicate permit limits were exceeded, a surcharge for the test discharge will be assessed.
(d)
The city shall not issue a wastewater discharge permit until such time as all amounts owed by the user to the City of Vienna, due are paid in full. If compliance is not achieved in accordance with the terms and conditions of a compliance schedule, the water and wastewater director may issue an order suspending or revoking the wastewater discharge permit.
(e)
Compliance schedule and retrofit of interconnections/storage areas. Upon determination that a user establishment is noncompliant with the terms and conditions specified in its permit or any provision of these regulations or needs to construct and/or acquire and install pretreatment facilities, the city administrator or his/her designee may also issue and require the establishment to abide by a compliance schedule. The issuance of a compliance schedule may contain terms and conditions including but not limited to requirements for installation of a pretreatment facility, submittal of drawings or reports, audit of waste hauling records, best management and waste minimization practices, installation of covers, berms and wastewater connections to the public sewer system, payment of fees, and/or other provisions to ensure compliance with these regulations.

For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(1)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (2), below, are met.
(2)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred, and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the city administrator or his/her designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days;
d.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
e.

A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 78-99(a) of this article or the specific propitiations in section 78-99(b)(3) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City of Vienna was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

new
(a)
For the purpose of this section:
(1)
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2)
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are subject to the following provisions:
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior written notice to the city administrator or his/her designee, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the city administrator or his/her designee of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. City administrator or his/her designee may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(c)
If the bypass is prohibited, and the city administrator or his/her designee may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1)
Bypass was unavailable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3)
The user submitted notices are required under subsection (b) of this section.
(d)
The city administrator or his/her designee may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions described in subsection (c) above.
