ARTICLE X. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 34-461. - Title.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Wetlands Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. of 2-8-16(2))
Sec. 34-462. - Purpose and intent.
Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well-being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map.
(Ord. of 2-8-16(2))
Sec. 34-463. - Definitions.
Generalized wetlands map: A map of wetlands provided in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map showing wetlands within the City of Vienna.
Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U. S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

Sec. 34-466. - Permit required.
No land use permit or building permit shall be issued for a land use, building, structure, or manufactured home, nor shall any regulated activity as defined by this article commence, unless the land use, building, structure, manufactured home or regulated activity conforms to the requirements of this article. Prior to a land use permit of building permit being issued, the building inspector shall require a site plan or subdivision plat insufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 2-8-16(2))
Sec. 34-467. - Jurisdictional wetland determination required.
If an area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland as shown on the generalized wetlands map, as determined by the zoning officer, no local land use permit or building permit on said wetland shall be issued until a jurisdictional wetland determination has been completed and either of the following occur:
(1)
The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that there are jurisdictional wetlands present on the proposed development site, a Section 404 permit is required, and either a Section 404 Permit or a letter of permission is issued by the Corps for the proposed development; or,
(2)
The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that jurisdictional wetlands are not present on the proposed development site, and no Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required.
(Ord. of 2-8-16(2))
Sec. 34-468. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within an area shown as a wetland on the generalized wetlands map, to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specific in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
