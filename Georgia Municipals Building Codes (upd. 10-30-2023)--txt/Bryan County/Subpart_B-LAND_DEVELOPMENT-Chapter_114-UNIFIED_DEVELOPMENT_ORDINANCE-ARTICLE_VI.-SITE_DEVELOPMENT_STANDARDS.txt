ARTICLE VI. - SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
This article sets the rules for lot/site development.
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 114-600. - Principal structures.
(a)
Agricultural district. With the exception of bona fide agricultural structures, only one principal structure and its customary accessory structures pursuant to article VII, division 2 may hereafter be erected on any lot. Any dwelling, including site-built dwellings, manufactured homes, mobile homes, or modular homes, shall be deemed to be a principal structure. The total number of principal structures on a lot may be increased in accordance with section 114-508, Agricultural/Residential District Use Conditions.
(b)
Rural residential and certain residential districts. In the RR-2.5, RR-1.5, RR-1, and R-15 districts, only one principal structure and its customary accessory structures pursuant to article VII, division 2 may hereafter be erected on any lot. Any dwelling, including site-built dwellings, manufactured homes, mobile homes, or modular homes, shall be deemed to be a principal structure. The total number of principal structures on a lot may be increased in accordance with section 114-508, Agricultural/Residential District Use Conditions.
(c)
Multi-family and manufactured housing park districts. In the R-M and R-MH districts, there may be more than one principal residential structure and more than one accessory structure (e.g., clubhouse, office administration building) situated on a lot, provided that:
(1)
An unobstructed accessway at least 20 feet wide is maintained from a road to each structure for use by service and emergency vehicles; and
(2)
Each structure on the lot is separated from any other structure on the lot by at least the minimum building separation requirement pursuant to article VIII and the building code.
(d)
Non-residential districts. In the B-1, B-2, C-I, I-1, I-2, P/I, WP, and WB districts, more than one principal structure devoted to non-residential uses may be situated on a lot, provided that:
(1)
An unobstructed accessway at least 20 feet wide is maintained from a road to each structure for use by service and emergency vehicles; and
(2)
Each structure on the lot is separated from any other structure on the lot by at least four feet unless a greater separation is required by the applicable building codes.
(e)
Tracts with multiple dwellings or principal structures. Where more than one dwelling or principal structure legally existed on a tract at the effective date of this UDO, such tract may be divided into an individual lot for each such dwelling or principal structure if the community development director determines that each lot meets the applicable requirements of this article or a variance is granted by the board of adjustments.
(f)
Planned development districts. Unless specifically modified by the approval of a PD, the provisions of this article shall apply to all development within the PD.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

Corner lots. Corner lots shall have sufficient width and depth to permit the establishment of required setbacks from both roads.
(d)
Lot dimensions. The area and dimensions of lots shall comply with the minimum standards of this article unless modified through the planned development process or varied by the board of adjustment. Minimum lot size requirements, however, may not be varied.
(e)
Flag lots. Flag lots are intended to only be used for the preservation of agricultural and sensitive lands or to address unique topographical situations in an A or RR district and are not intended to act in lieu of an interior subdivision road built to County standards. After determination by the community development director that standard lots are not feasible, the community development director or board of commissioners may, in order to encourage more efficient use of land and to help preserve agricultural and sensitive lands, allow flag lots to be developed subject to the following conditions.
(1)
The property cannot be subdivided with typical street frontage either at the present or in the foreseeable future.
(2)
The flagpole or access strip portion of said lot shall front on a dedicated public or approved private street. The minimum width of the access strip portion of the lot shall be 30 feet.

( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-604. - Easements.
All easements within subdivisions and along individual lots must be designed in accordance with the Engineering Design Manual and must be shown on a final plat. A non-permanent structure (e.g., flagpole, mailbox, fence, etc.) may be located within an easement required pursuant to this Section, but fences may not impede drainage flows. The county may require the non-permanent structure to be removed if needed to address maintenance or drainage issues. The following types of easements shall be required within subdivisions:
(a)
Individual lot. Easements having a minimum width of five feet and located along the side lot lines and a minimum of ten feet along the rear lot lines shall be provided, as required, for utility lines, underground mains and cables, and drainage. If required, the property owner will provide a greater width for the easements at the direction of the engineering director.
(b)
Drainage. Where a proposed subdivision or site development is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, the developer of such proposed subdivision shall offer the county an exclusive stormwater easement that shall conform substantially with the lines of such watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream and shall be of such additional width as deemed necessary for access and maintenance purposes by the public works director. At a minimum, the access and maintenance easement shall be 20 feet in width along one side of the drainage channel. Such easements may be used as a location for pedestrian ways, bikeways and other amenities which do not conflict with the basic maintenance function of such easements.
(c)
County maintenance easement. Maintenance easements shall be provided when deemed necessary by the public works director and/or engineering director.
(d)
Utilities. Easements for utilities serving a proposed subdivision or non-residential development must be shown on the final plat or site plan. If a final plat is not required, the engineering director may require an owner to execute an easement document.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-605. - Mailbox kiosks.

Secs. 114-606—114-609. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - BULK AND DENSITY STANDARDS

Sec. 114-610. - Structure height.
(a)
District standards. Subject to the provisions of this section, buildings and structures shall not exceed the maximum heights established in the applicable zoning district's development standards.
(b)
Measurement.
(1)
The height of a building is the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of finished grade at the front building line or the base flood elevation to the highest point of a flat roof or parapet, the deck line of a mansard roof, or the midpoint between the ridge and the eave for a pitched roof (see building height definition for more detail). When a roof plane with the tallest ridge has dormers, height shall be based on the primary roof plane, with the dormers having no impact on height measurement unless they are higher than the highest ridge.
(2)
For buildings subject to the height transition provisions, height is measured to the highest point of the building at the applicable distance from the property line.
(c)
Institutional structures. The following buildings, where authorized in a zoning district, may be constructed to any height subject to Fire and Building Codes and the requirement that any portion of a structure exceeding the maximum height of the district is set back from each property line at least one foot for every one foot that that portion of the building exceeds the maximum height of the applicable zoning district:
(1)
Government offices;
(2)
Schools;
(3)
Libraries; and
(4)
Hospitals larger than 10,000 square feet of floor area.

(3)
Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors and similar equipment, fixtures and devices are exempt, provided that they are set back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every foot the feature extends above the roof surface. Screen or parapet walls shall be constructed to the height of any fixture taller than three feet in height that would be visible from a street or residential property abutting the property.
(e)
Additional rules for specific structures.
(1)
Towers and antennas, where allowed, are subject to the provisions of chapter 113 of the Bryan County Code.
(2)
Fences in the RR, R, and PD zoning districts may not exceed eight feet in height and may not exceed ten feet in height for all other districts. Additionally, in the RR, R, and PD zoning districts, the maximum height of a fence in the front yard shall be four feet.
(f)
Height transitions. The following provisions for height transitions are measured from property lines of parcels where multi-family, mixed-use or non-residential structures abut an arterial connector or collector road, or A-5, RR or R-15 zoning district. For purposes of this section, any story taller than 15 feet shall be considered to be two stories.
(1)
In all districts, balconies that are located above the second story shall be setback at least 100 feet from affected property lines.

(2)
Residential districts. Except as provided herein, no accessory structure shall be located within any required front, side, or rear setback.
(3)
Commercial, industrial and public/institutional districts. Except as provided herein, no accessory structure shall be located within any required setback area except in the WB district.
(c)
Allowed setback encroachments.
(1)
Piers, docks, and other water-dependent accessory structures may be located in any required setback or yard on lots that abut a body of water or marsh.
(2)
A patio at grade associated with a residential use, path, or walkway may be located in any required setback or yard provided that they are not located within a required buffer. For a patio at grade, no portion of the patio, however, may be closer than five feet to a property line.
(3)
A fence, wall, mailbox, power pole, light pole, or berm may be located in any required setback or yard.
(4)
Signs may be located in a required setback that abuts a road.

A detached single-family or duplex residence may encroach a maximum of five feet into the required front setback, provided that a front-facing garage is set back to the required front setback.
b.
An unenclosed covered front porch may extend up to ten feet from the allowed building front setback provided that the porch is at least five feet in depth (see Exhibit 611a).
Exhibit 611a: Allowable Front Porch Encroachment
c.
Accessory swimming pools, open and unenclosed, may encroach a maximum of ten feet into a required rear setback. Every swimming pool shall be protected by a safety fence or barrier approved by the building official. Patios at grade shall be governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
d.
For enclosed, including screened, swimming pools, all portions of the swimming pools must meet required setbacks.
1.
Eaves and overhangs may encroach up to two feet into required building setbacks, subject to building and fire code limitations.
2.
A step, stoop, and unenclosed porch (except for porches addressed in paragraph (5) of this section), awnings or other appurtenances may extend up to five feet from the minimum required side or rear setback for the applicable portion of the structure, provided such features do not impede pedestrian circulation.
3.
Canopies and portes cochere may encroach up to 50 percent of the required front or street side setback areas on lots occupied by churches, schools, hospitals, clinics, funeral homes, hotels, assisted living centers, continuing care retirement communities, or governmental buildings, and institutions of a philanthropic, educational, or religious nature.
(d)
Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment shall not be located within any front yard; it may encroach up to three feet into a required side or rear setback if screened from view from adjacent streets or abutting property.
(e)
Setbacks for principal structures. The minimum setbacks for principal structures shall comply with the development standards established for the applicable zoning district. Standards for the PD district shall be determined in conjunction with PD approval. Additional setbacks may be required to meet height, parking, planting, buffering, stormwater, or other standards specified in this article or the use standards of article V, article VII, and article VIII.
(f)
Setback measurement. The setback is the shortest horizontal distance from the applicable property line to nearest extension of any part of a building or regulated structure that is substantially a part of the building or structure itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a flagpole, etc.). The following rules are used to identify the applicable yard on which the setbacks are based when the yard cannot be readily determined based on the definition. (see Exhibits 611b and 611c)
(1)
When a lot has street frontage on two contiguous sides, the frontage shall be determined by the community development director based on the most prevalent orientation of lots on each street. Where lots along a block face front equally on each street, the shorter of the two property lines abutting the street shall be considered the front property line and the longer property line shall be considered the exterior side or street side property line.
(2)
A duplex, multi-family dwelling, mixed-use, or non-residential structure located on a corner lot that has front entries to separate units on each street shall be considered to have frontage on each street and shall meet front setback requirements on each street.
(3)
When a lot has frontage on two non-contiguous property lines (e.g., for through lots), the lot is considered to have two front yards, and each shall be subject to the front yard setback requirements.
(4)
For lots served by an access easement, the front yard shall be determined by the orientation of the house and location of the driveway.
(5)
Setbacks from roads identified in the Capital Improvement Plan and with an identified funding source for widening shall be measured from the future right-of-way.
Exhibit 611b: Front Yard Determination for Normal and Double-Frontage or Through Lots
Exhibit 611c: Front Yard Determination for Flag Lots
(6)
When a lot has more than one property line that is opposite the front yard, the rear property line shall be the lot line that is closest to paralleling the front property line and the rear setback shall be measured from that property line. The other property line shall be considered a side property line. (see Exhibit 611d)
Exhibit 611d: Determining Rear and Side Yards for Irregular Lots
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-612. - Lot area, lot width, density and gross area coverage.
The minimum lot area, lot width, and gross area coverage shall comply with the development standards for the applicable zoning district. Standards for the PD district shall be determined in conjunction with PD approval. These requirements also may be affected by parking, planting, buffering, stormwater, wastewater or other standards specified in this article or the specific use standards of article V, article VII, and article VIII.
(a)
Measuring density. Density shall be calculated on a net basis for major residential subdivisions and multi-family development. The overall density for a major residential subdivision or multi-family development, not located in a PD, shall be calculated by excluding areas dedicated to jurisdictional wetlands, ponds, and drainage canals. Minor subdivision density may be calculated on a gross density basis provided that each parcel has sufficient buildable area and complies with health department requirements.
(b)
Measuring lot width. Minimum lot width is the shortest distance between side property lines at all points between the front and rear setbacks (see Exhibit 612a).
Exhibit 612a: Lot Width Measurement
(c)
Maximum percentage of gross land area to be covered. The maximum percentage of gross land area to be covered is the percentage of the lot that has impervious coverage, including buildings, impervious pavement, and other impervious surfaces, including the water surface area of a swimming pool. Gravel and other surfaces on a compacted base shall be considered impervious surfaces.
(d)
Lots on cul-de-sac roads. Frontage for lots abutting a cul-de-sac turn-around shall be at least 35 percent of the minimum lot width (see Exhibit 612b).
Exhibit 612b: Minimum Frontage for Cul-de-sac Lots
(e)
Lots on exterior of road curves. Frontage for lots located on the outside of a curve in the road shall be at least 70 percent of the minimum lot width (see Exhibit 612c)
Exhibit 612c: Lot Frontage on Road Curves
(f)
Lots with non-continuous road frontages (existing). Where the road frontage of a tract that is an existing lot of record is not continuous ("non-continuous tract") and where the road frontage of any part of a non-continuous tract ("non-continuous part") does not meet the minimum road frontage, such non-continuous tract may still be subdivided, provided (see Exhibit 612d):
(1)
The number of lots does not exceed the number of non-continuous parts;
(2)
The lot meets the minimum width and area requirements of the applicable zoning district; and
(3)
All of the road frontage of a non-continuous part is used as a lot.
Exhibit 612d: Existing Lots with Non-continuous Frontage
(g)
Lots with non-continuous road frontages (new). When a new lot is proposed with non-continuous road frontage, each non-continuous part must meet minimum road frontage requirements.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
DIVISION 3. - NON-RESIDENTIAL ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Sec. 114-613. - Access and circulation.
(a)
Commercial development projects should be designed to provide connections between neighborhoods, adjacent compatible uses and area-wide trail systems. When adjacent residential and/or non-residential uses can mutually benefit from connection rather than separation, connective elements shall be incorporated into the project design. Benefits, location, and specific improvements will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Examples of connective elements include:
(1)
Pedestrian walkways;
(2)
Pedestrian gates;
(3)
Common landscape areas; and
(4)
Other design features that allow/encourage two-way access between uses.
(b)
On-site circulation systems for non-residential development shall be designed to avoid conflicts between vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic.
(c)
Drive aisles shall meet the minimum requirements identified in the parking specifications section.
(d)
Pursuant to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all non-residential developments shall be designed with a minimum of one designated pedestrian path from each abutting street to the primary entrance(s) of the development.
(e)
For large-scale development, internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of raised sidewalks, special pavers, bricks, and/or scored/stamped concrete/asphalt and shall comply with ADA requirements. Large-scale development, for purposes of this standard, is generally development in the B-2, P/I and C-I zoning districts and total building square footage exceeding 10,000 square feet.
(f)
To minimize conflicting vehicle turning movement along major roadways, shared access drives within and between integrated non-residential developments are encouraged to reduce the number of curb cuts. The county also encourages reciprocal access between non-residential developments to provide for convenience, safety, and efficient circulation. If incorporated, a reciprocal access agreement shall be recorded with the land by the owners of abutting properties to ensure that there will be continued availability of the shared access.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
DIVISION 4. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 114-614. - Purpose.
Recognizing that different land uses have varying requirements for off-street parking, the county finds it necessary to establish minimum requirements for facilities and space for the off-street parking of vehicles and loading and unloading of goods, in order to promote the economic vitality, safety of pedestrians and motorists, the orderly movement of people, vehicles and goods, and safe access to properties.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-615. - Applicability.
(a)
Generally. No development permit shall be issued that causes any of the following situations unless the use for which the permit is being sought complies with these off-street parking and loading regulations:
(1)
New building or use. Whenever a new building or use is established.
(2)
Expansion of a building or structure. Whenever an existing building or structure is enlarged, and the enlargement causes an increase in the number of required parking spaces.
(3)
Expansion or change of use. Whenever the use of an existing building, structure or site is expanded or changed so that it will increase the number of required parking spaces.
(4)
Resurfacing or enlarging existing parking areas. Whenever an existing parking lot is resurfaced or is expanded by the greater of ten percent or six spaces, parking lot surfaces shall comply with the provisions of this UDO. For purposes of this section, resurfacing does not apply to patching, resealing, seal-coating or overlaying existing surfaces.
(b)
Existing structures and uses. Structures and land uses in existence on the date of enactment of this UDO, or structures and uses for which building permits have been applied for or approved on the said date, shall not be subject to the parking and loading requirements set forth in this section. However, any parking and loading facilities now existing to serve such structures or uses may only be reduced if they continue to comply with the minimum parking and loading standards established herein.
(c)
Exemptions. The community development director may adjust or waive the requirement for additional parking in the following circumstances:
(1)
If the expansion or change of use of an existing development increases the demand for spaces but the applicant demonstrates the adequacy of existing parking to meet existing and projected demands.
(2)
If the expansion or change of demand is less than the greater of ten percent of the total parking requirement or five or fewer spaces. This provision may be used only once for any given site.
(3)
If the existing parking is non-conforming, yet accommodates existing demands, the community development director may base the increased parking requirement on the demand created by the expansion of the building or use.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

(7)
Vehicles parked on a lot and visible from the street, must be operable and have current registration, i.e., license plate. Vehicles not complying with this requirement will be considered an inoperable motor vehicle as defined in the International Property Maintenance Code, and they must either be parked or stored in an enclosed structure or parked or stored behind the structure and screened from view.
(b)
Multifamily dwellings.
(1)
At least 50 percent of parking spaces required for multifamily dwellings shall be provided within 50 feet of the building served by the parking.
(2)

(c)
The following documentation shall be provided in conjunction with a request for shared parking:
(1)
A shared parking analysis submitted to the community development director that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development or combination of uses, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
(2)
A shared parking plan and agreement signed by owner of the shared parking area stating that:
a.
The land comprising the parking area shall never be disposed of, except in conjunction with the sale of the building so long as the facilities are required; and

The county may agree to void the written agreement if other off-street facilities are provided in accord with these parking regulations.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-621. - Temporary parking.
For temporary uses and special events that result in a temporary reduction in the availability of required parking spaces or create a need for temporary off-site parking, such as outdoor sales events (seasonal sales), festivals or fairs, concerts, or sporting events, the community development director may authorize the use of a portion of the required parking area for other purposes on a temporary basis or permit temporary off-site parking, upon a demonstration by the applicant that temporary off-site parking is located and designed to ensure safe and efficient circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles (a site plan may be required to demonstrate this), the proposed special event satisfies all other applicable county regulations and:
(a)
The loss of the required parking spaces may be offset by requiring employees or customers to park elsewhere or that due to the time of year or nature of the on-site business, the required spaces are not needed;
(b)
All or part of the displaced parking may be accommodated on unpaved areas of the site;
(c)
Permission has been granted by affected owners or operators to use their parking facilities; or
(d)
The duration of the special event is so short or of such a nature as to not create any appreciable parking shortage for the normal operation of the existing on-site use;

Sec. 114-630. - Buffer design requirements.
(a)
Generally. Buffers required under this section shall consist of undisturbed vegetation, planted trees and shrubs, or a combination of vegetation (planted or existing) and walls and berms that effectively screen development from the abutting road or property. The intent of these requirements is to encourage the preservation of mature and healthy, and indigenous vegetation. It is not the intent of this UDO to require existing vegetation to be removed in order to plant immature non-native species or maintain unhealthy tree stands.
(b)
When required. Prior to approval of construction plans for a subdivision or site plan requiring buffers, the applicant shall submit the landscape plans with buffer details for review and approval.
(c)
Buffer planting requirements.
(1)
Planted buffers. Exhibit 630 lists the number of each type of plant required to be planted within buffers that are planted in conjunction with subdivision or site development. At least 30 percent of buffer trees and 50 percent of shrubs shall be evergreens. Not more than 25 percent of required trees or shrubs may be of the same species.

1 See section 114-635 for list of large, medium and small canopy trees and shrubs.
2 For buffers exceeding 100' in width, the community development director shall approve the required plantings.
  (2)
Existing vegetation. Where mature existing vegetation is protected and retained during the development process, the community development director may reduce the required buffer plantings upon finding that the existing vegetation will accomplish equivalent or better screening than a planted buffer. When the existing vegetation is insufficient to provide adequate screening, the required additional plantings shall be located to enhance the effectiveness of the natural buffer's screening and to ensure that not more than 25 percent of trees or shrubs (existing and planted) are of the same species.
(3)
Buffer maintenance.
a.
Required buffers will not be disturbed for any reason except for permitted signs, driveways, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences, or required landscaping, landscaping maintenance and replacement, or maintenance and construction of utility lines and drainage features that cross the buffer.
b.
Where utility or drainage easements exist along property lines, the buffer shall be located adjacent to the easement and may be reduced by the width of the easement on the property where the buffer is required or 25 percent of the required buffer width, whichever is smaller.
(4)
Buffers with supplemental walls or berms. When walls or berms meeting the following requirements are provided the minimum width of a required buffer may be reduced by five feet. Fences have no impact on the minimum required width of a buffer.
a.
Walls. Any wall used as part of a buffer shall be constructed in durable fashion of brick, stone, or other masonry material or a combination thereof. Walls shall be a minimum height of six feet. Where walls are included in the buffer, they shall be located along the interior side of the buffer.
b.
Berms. Berms shall be a minimum height of four feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six feet in height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line. Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and shall be landscaped.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-631. - Parking area landscaping.
(a)
Applicability. Parking area planting requirements shall apply to all development or redevelopment that requires the establishment of ten or more parking spaces.
(b)
Existing parking lots. For existing parking lots that currently do not comply with the required parking lot plantings, such plantings shall be provided when any one of the following occurs:
(1)
A new principal building is constructed;
(2)
A building addition is constructed that expands the building footprint by at least the lesser of 30 percent or 5,000 square feet;
(3)
Rehabilitation of a building with a non-conforming parking lot that exceeds 50 percent of the appraised value of the building.
(4)
An existing parking lot is reconstructed or repaved or substantially modified;
(5)
When an existing parking lot under ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area is expanded by 50 percent or more in total surface area; or
(6)
When an existing parking lot over ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area is expanded by 25 percent or more in total surface area.
(c)
Interior parking lot planting.
(1)
An interior planting island shall be provided for every ten spaces. Each island shall contain a minimum of 200 square feet with a minimum dimension of eight feet. Islands are not required in parking areas dedicated to tractor trailer parking. The community development director shall have final authority on determining if an area shall be considered "tractor trailer truck parking."
(2)
Ten percent of the parking area (spaces and drive aisles) will be landscaped in a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving with islands and barriers. These areas must be located throughout the parking area so that no parking space is more than 100 feet from the nearest tree. For every ten off-street parking spaces, a minimum of one tree and three shrubs must be planted within required islands and barriers of the parking area.
(3)
Planting islands should be dispersed in a safe and efficient manner to promote safe pedestrian and traffic movements, and to increase on-site stormwater detention. (See Exhibit 631)
(4)
Parking lot planting shall be provided in addition to required buffers or perimeter plantings provided by the applicant.
Exhibit 631: Sample Interior Parking Island and Parking Lot Layout
(d)
Parking areas abutting residential lots. On side and rear lot lines where parking areas abut any single-family or duplex residential lot, the required buffer shall include a berm or an opaque wall or fence, not taller than six feet in height and not less than 42 inches in height.
(e)
Streetyard planting for commercial areas abutting right-of-way. For properties abutting arterial or collector roads that are used for commercial retail, service or office uses, the applicant may request to provide a street yard in lieu of a buffer. Such request must be approved by the community development director. If approved, the street yard shall be adjacent to the public right-of-way and include a planting strip along the entire length of the perimeter of the street facing area excluding authorized driveway widths.
(1)
For all development abutting arterial roads the following standards shall apply:
a.
A minimum 25 foot deep landscaped street yard shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along the road right-of-way in lieu of the required buffer. If an easement parallels the right-of-way frontage and precludes the ability to meet the streetyard requirement, the streetyard shall be in addition to the easement or increased to the extent that the planting requirements can be met. (Example: If a 15-foot power easement was directly adjacent to the right-of-way and did not permit trees within it, the 25 foot street yard would commence from the interior edge of the easement for a total of 40 feet).
b.
The street yard shall include:
1.
Two large canopy trees per 100 feet of linear frontage, spaced no more than 50 feet on center (o.c.) for the entire lot frontage. For areas where overhead utilities exist that preclude planting large trees, groups of three small canopy trees shall be provided for every one large tree required.

5.
Driveways should be defined using a mixture of trees, shrubs and groundcovers that will create a sense of arrival. Clusters of flowering and other ornamental plant species such as knockout roses, ornamental grasses and annuals is strongly encouraged. A minimum of 200 square feet shall be planted on each side of the entrance drive. Sight triangle requirements of section 114-1008 shall be maintained.
(2)
For all development abutting collector roads, the following standards shall apply:
a.
A minimum 25 foot deep landscaped street yard shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along the road right-of-way. If an easement parallels the right-of-way frontage and precludes the ability to meet the streetyard requirement, the streetyard shall be in addition to the easement or increased to the extent that the planting requirements can be met. (Example: If a 15-foot power easement was directly adjacent to the right-of-way and did not permit trees within it, the 25-foot streetyard would commence from the interior edge of the easement for a total of 40 feet).
b.
The street yard shall include:
1.
One large canopy tree per 100 feet of linear frontage, spaced no more than 50 feet on center (o.c.) for the entire lot frontage. For areas where overhead utilities exist that preclude planting large trees, groups of three small canopy trees shall be provided for every one large tree required.
2.
Two medium canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage.
3.
Two small canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage.

Clusters of flowering and other ornamental plant species such as knockout roses, ornamental grasses and annuals is strongly encouraged. A minimum of 200 square feet shall be planted on each side of the entrance drive. Sight triangle requirements of section 114-1008 shall be maintained.
(3)
All required street yards shall contain only living landscaping materials, mulch, and fences or walls; provided, the following may be located within the streetyard when approved by the community development director:
a.
Walls and fences less than five feet in height shall be encouraged;
b.
Vehicular access drives placed approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way;
c.
Electrical, telephone, gas, water supply, sewage disposal, and other utilities may be constructed to pass through or across the required streetyard area. If the installation of such services impacts the requirements of this UDO, additional landscaping and/or streetyard area may be required to meet the intent and standards of this section;
d.
Foot and bicycle paths (including sidewalks);
e.
Landscape sculpture, lighting fixtures, trellises, pedestrian amenities and arbors;
f.
Signs;
g.

(6)
Any area not otherwise planted shall be mulched.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-632. - Additional screening, planting and fencing requirements.
(a)
Screening of outdoor storage, service areas, mechanical equipment and dumpsters. For multi-family, commercial, mixed-use, and industrial uses, authorized outdoor storage, service areas, mechanical equipment and dumpsters shall be screened with walls so they are not visible from adjacent properties or public right-of-way, in accordance with the following:
(1)
The design of a screening wall, excluding the gate, shall be the same architectural style and materials as the principal building or buildings on the lot.
(2)
The height of a wall shall be adequate to block view to the area being screened, but shall not exceed eight feet, except as otherwise allowed by this section.
(3)
The height of a wall shall be measured from the finished grade at the base of the wall to the top of the wall, but shall not include columns or posts.
(4)
Walls shall be interrupted at intervals not exceeding 25 feet by architectural features such as pilasters or columns or by various species of plants that are at least as tall as or taller than the wall.
(5)
Such walls shall be setback a minimum of five feet from any adjacent property lines.
(6)
In industrial districts, the community development director may approve the use of a combination of fencing and plantings in lieu of a wall to screen such features from abutting industrial property.
(b)
Landscaping at the base of signs. There shall be established a landscaping area around each principal freestanding sign that is equal to or greater than the total area of all sides of the sign structure. The sign landscaping area shall extend from the base or structural supports of the sign equally in every direction, but no less than five feet. Within this sign landscaping area, the following standards shall apply:
(1)
All portions of the sign landscaping area shall be surrounded by protective covering and covered by landscape materials except for those ground areas that are covered by permitted structures.

For single family and duplex lots within a major subdivision, including a PD, at least two large canopy trees shall be planted within the six-foot planting strip, as required in article X, between the edge of pavement for the road and the sidewalk along the frontage of each lot. The developer shall include a street tree planting plan and installation schedule with the required landscape plans. Unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners, street tree maintenance and replacement shall be the responsibility of the subdivision's Homeowner's Association. In order to provide a unified streetscape, street trees do not need to comply with the maximum genus and species requirements. The CCRs for the homeowners' association shall clearly identify maintenance responsibility for the trees, and the ongoing duty to maintain the street trees. The street trees shall also count toward required tree canopy for the overall subdivision. If the homeowners' association fails to maintain the street trees, the county may remove and replace such trees and bill the homeowners' association.
(d)
Fences and walls.
(1)
Except as otherwise required by this UDO, fences or walls shall be constructed in durable fashion of brick, stone, or other masonry material or wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials or a combination thereof.
(2)
Unless otherwise specified, required walls and fences shall be a minimum height of six feet above grade.
(3)
No more than 25 percent of required fence surfaces shall be left open and the finish side of the fence shall face the abutting road or property. A chain link fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy fencing requirements.
(4)
No fence or wall located in a required setback in a RR-2.5, RR-1.5, RR-1, R-15, R-M, RMH and PD zoning district shall be built to a height more than eight feet above grade.

Sec. 114-634. - Canopy retention and tree preservation.
modified
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to maintain tree canopy coverage in Bryan County and to protect and preserve heritage and historic trees. These provisions apply to residential and non-residential properties and development as identified herein.
(b)
Canopy retention.
(1)
Canopy requirements. All applicable development shall be required to maintain a minimum tree canopy of 40 percent. Trees may be tiered and grouped with small canopy trees planted under the canopy of a new or existing large or medium canopy tree; however, a maximum of three small canopy trees per one large or medium canopy tree shall be allowed in calculating total
canopy coverage. Total canopy coverage shall be computed from sum of the small, medium or large canopy trees retained or planted. All trees retained or planted subject to other provisions of this division may be used to satisfy this requirement.
(2)
Applicability. Canopy requirements of this section are applicable to:
a.
Major subdivisions (including planned developments) being developed;
b.
Non-residential, multi-family, and mixed-use projects (including commercial development in planned developments) being developed;
c.
Any activity requiring issuance of a land disturbance permit, except for individual residential lots and minor subdivisions.
(3)
Canopy analysis. The tree protection and preservation plan, including tree survey, shall be submitted with landscape plans as required in section 114-420. The plan shall be based on the gross area to be developed and shall show the canopy line for each proposed tree. Once the developer sells individual lots, the builder/owner is responsible for implementing the plan for individual lots.
(4)
Standards for compliance. The canopy requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development or disturbance of the applicable site. The canopy may be achieved by preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this UDO or by a combination of the two. Minimum tree canopy shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix D-3 to this UDO. Any existing tree of not less than six inches DBH left in good growing condition on the property is eligible to be counted toward the minimum required canopy and has to be protected. Existing trees that will remain and be used toward meeting minimum canopy requirements, shall be identified on the tree protection and preservation plan of the required landscape plan.
(5)
Trees in wetlands. Fifty percent of the canopy coverage in wetlands can be utilized to satisfy the canopy coverage requirements. In the General Industrial (I-2) zoning district, the allowable percent shall be 75. If canopy coverage in wetlands meets the 40 percent gross canopy coverage required by this UDO, the developer/builder shall still be required to meet the planting requirements identified in other sections of this UDO, (e.g., street tree requirement buffers, screening, and parking lot planting).
(6)
Qualifying trees. Trees replanted to achieve canopy requirements are to be selected from species listed in section 114-635. Indigenous species may be selected for replanting even though it may not be included in section 114-635 upon approval by the community development director. In addition, replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one large or medium canopy tree for every three small canopy trees. Canopy credit may be met by planting all large or medium canopy trees, but not by planting only small canopy trees. No more than 25 percent of any one species may be included in any replanting plan. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability.
(c)
Tree preservation.
(1)
Protected tree classifications. These regulations shall apply to two categories of trees: Heritage Trees and Historic Trees. Heritage trees and historic trees shall be collectively known as protected trees.
a.
Heritage tree. All trees meeting a minimum of 16 inches diameter at breast height (dbh) up to 28 inches dbh.
b.
Historic tree. A historic tree, due to its age and stature, is considered to have irreplaceable value and is defined as any tree 28 inches in dbh or greater.
(2)
Removal of single/individual trees. Except as otherwise exempt, it shall be unlawful to fell, improperly prune, or otherwise destroy a Protected Tree without first obtaining a tree removal permit from the community development director. A tree removal permit shall not be necessary to remove a tree creating imminent danger to other trees, permanent structures, public utilities, rights-of-way or persons or for the ordinary pruning, trimming, and maintenance of a protected tree. A tree posing imminent danger shall be defined as one damaged by a storm, fire, or vehicular accident such that its structural integrity is seriously compromised and that the tree can be reasonably expected to fall and injure persons or structures. Applications for permit shall be submitted as outlined in article IV.
(3)
Major subdivision/site plan development. All applications for sketch plat, construction plans or site plan approval, must include a Tree Survey with protected trees identified. The tree survey may be submitted with required landscape plans or separately. The tree survey shall comply with the submittal requirements identified section 114-420. Protected Trees, unless otherwise permitted by these regulations, shall not be removed or be caused to be removed until such Construction Plans and Landscape Plans are approved.
(4)
Standards for property development. The following criteria shall be followed with respect to the applicable property development:
a.
Subdivision of parcel: The subdivider shall make conscious efforts to avoid protected trees in proposing placement of rights-of-way and easements. Additionally, lots shall be platted in a way that avoids removal of historic trees or groupings of heritage trees such as locating them in the middle of proposed lots. Lot lines should be platted adjacent to protected trees to retain them as design features and vegetative buffers and to mitigate storm water run-off and erosion problems.
b.
Building envelopes: Historic trees within proposed building envelopes shall be mitigated, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. Heritage trees within proposed building envelopes, as well as those within 20 feet of the envelope, may be removed when necessary without mitigation.
c.
Yards and buffers: Protected trees shall not be removed from required yards, streetyards, or buffers. A protected tree may be limbed up if located outside a required buffer, or if located within a required visual buffer or clearance zone. Heritage trees may be limbed up to eight feet, while historic trees may be limbed up to 16 feet to provide view sheds.
d.
Means of access and parking: Historic trees shall not be removed to make way for parking lots, parking space, drive aisles, or driveways, unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the community development director that no reasonable alternative exists. If removal is permitted, the applicant shall mitigate as required in paragraph (f) of this section. Heritage trees may be removed in these locations, but mitigation shall be required in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
e.
Outdoor uses and active recreation areas. Protected trees may be removed on land where the proposed principal use is conducted primarily outside; provided, mitigation shall be required in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The community development director shall determine whether the proposed outdoor use qualifies under this provision and that the protected tree removal is the minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed use. Qualifying uses shall include, but are not limited to: outdoor sales areas with minimal ancillary indoor space, transportation and construction businesses that store fleet vehicles on site, outdoor storage of oversized bulk items that cannot practically be stored under roof, industrial activities and processes that do not occur under roof, as well as recreation areas, such as golf courses, athletic fields, courts, and pools managed by schools, public recreation departments, country clubs, home owners associations and other legally established organizations.
(5)
Waters of the state: Protected trees within 25 feet of any water of the State shall be preserved and no disturbance shall occur within the critical root zone, even if more than 25 feet distant from such water.
(6)
Streets: Protected trees may be removed without mitigation from rights-of-way to allow for arterial and collector street construction, including widening, intersection improvements, parallel bicycle/pedestrian improvements, and drainage improvements. Historic trees removed for construction of local street projects shall be mitigated in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, while heritage trees may be removed from local street rights-of-way without mitigation. This provision only applies to projects undertaken by local or State government.
(7)
Water, sewer, and drainage improvements: Protected trees may be removed, but must be mitigated in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, for installation of water, sewer, and drainage infrastructure and implementation of associated easements. This provision only applies to projects undertaken by local or State government.

Timbering/logging. If a property owner timbers/logs a property pursuant to silviculture operations, the property owner, including successors in interest, may not submit an application for sketch plat, site plan, or construction plan approval for a period of two years after the end of silviculture operations unless the property owner conducted a tree survey in accordance with this UDO and submitted the tree survey to the community development department. All protected trees identified on the tree survey that are removed shall be mitigated if the property owner seeks to develop the property before the expiration of the two-year period.
(e)
Violation and penalty.
(1)
The removal, damage or destruction of a protected tree without a required tree removal permit or approval of the tree preservation and protection plan of the landscape plan, shall constitute a violation of this UDO. Each protected tree that is removed, damaged or destroyed shall constitute a separate offense. Each day during which the loss of the tree goes unmitigated, as provided below, shall be judged a separate offense.
(2)
In lieu of any fines and penalties incurred by a violator of this section, the community development director may require tree replacement as a condition of granting certificates of occupancy. Replacement trees shall be required such that the total caliper-inches of new trees shall be equivalent to a 50 percent increase in the mitigation requirements as set forth in in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. In no case, however, shall any replacement tree measure less than four inch dbh for heritage trees and historic trees.
(3)
In the event that violations of this section result in the issuance of a stop work order, the violator shall be responsible for tree replacement, payment of fines or posting a financial guarantee, as determined by the community development director, before construction is allowed to resume.
(4)
In the event that the violator of tree protection standards cannot be identified and located, the developer shall be held responsible for fines and mitigation.
(f)
Mitigation for tree removal; fee in lieu. Trees planted for mitigation shall meet performance standards per this section. In addition, the following requirements shall apply:
(1)
Mitigation for heritage trees shall occur at a rate of 50 percent, where every two inches of heritage trees removed, measured in dbh, shall be replaced by one inch of mitigation trees, measured in caliper-inches.
(2)
Mitigation for historic trees shall occur at a rate of 100 percent, where every inch of historic trees removed, measured in dbh, shall be replaced by one inch of mitigation trees, measured in caliper-inches.
(3)
Any tree planted for mitigation shall measure at least four inches dbh for Heritage trees and historic trees, at the time of planting.
(4)
Any tree at least six inches dbh but less than 16 inches dbh retained within the area of disturbance may be retained to contribute, inch for inch, to a tree mitigation requirement; provided, the tree does not stand in a wetland, any required buffer, or other area in which the tree would otherwise be required to be conserved. Such trees shall be protected as heritage trees.
(5)
In lieu of planting trees required for mitigation, the developer may, if approved by community development director, pay a fee per caliper-inch in an amount set by the board of commissioners. The fee shall be based on the current cost, at wholesale value, of installing a required tree to standards of the American Nursery and Landscape Association and its maintenance for one year.
(6)
Fees in lieu shall be put into an account reserved solely for the beautification of public lands and rights-of-way in Bryan County.
(7)
Trees planted for mitigation in new developments shall be in addition to those required for streetscapes, buffering and parking lots and shall be used to create a streetyard in existing developments where such streetyard does not currently exist.

(3)
Promote the health of Bryan County residents.
(b)
The recreational facility requirements of this division apply to planned developments, major residential subdivisions, and multi-family or mixed-use developments, having a residential component, requiring subdivision or site plan approval.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-644. - Ownership and maintenance of recreational areas.
(a)
Recreational facilities required to be provided by the applicant in accordance this division shall not be dedicated to the public but shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or the developer's successor) or a homeowners' association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria established in section 114-640.
(b)

( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-645. - Recreational facility requirements.
(a)
When required. In conjunction with an application for preliminary development plan approval in a PD district, site plan approval for multi-family development, or sketch plat approval for a major subdivision, the applicant shall identify proposed recreational facilities that will be provided in conjunction with the development of the proposed subdivision. The application shall identify the land areas, types and sizes of facilities, and proposed equipment. The recreational facilities associated with the preliminary development plan, site plan, or sketch plat approval shall be the minimum facilities that must be constructed before 30 percent of the lots or multi-family dwelling units in any phase of a subdivision or development have been issued a building permit.
(b)
Required recreational facilities. All subject development shall include the following recreational facilities:
(1)
Active recreational land. In addition to required open space, single-family and multi-family developments with 50 or more dwelling units in one or more phases shall provide active recreation facilities on one or more parcels totaling at least one and one-half acres of usable area plus one-half acre for each additional 50 dwelling units. Active recreational land and open space areas, as provided for in section 114-637(b), may be developed in any combination of active recreational facilities listed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Active recreational land (multi-family). For multi-family developments, with fewer than 50 dwelling units, the developer shall provide active recreational land at a rate of 150 square feet per dwelling unit. This recreational land shall be used to meet the minimum active playground requirement in paragraph (c). This requirement may be waived if the proposed multi-family project is within a quarter mile of a public park.
(c)
Eligible active recreational facilities. Where active recreational facilities are required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the development shall include any combination of the following facilities that totals one credit per 50 dwelling units. In calculating required credits, if a development exceeds the 50 dwelling units by 24 or fewer units, the required credit shall be rounded down and if it exceeds the 50 dwelling units by 25 or more dwelling units, the required credit shall be rounded up. For example, if the development has 124 units, two credits are required, but if the development has 125 units, three credits are required. Subject developments shall provide a combination of recreational facilities and may not satisfy requirements by providing multiples of only one type of facility (e.g., three picnic areas to achieve 1.5 credits).
(1)
Active recreation fields - These may consist of open fields or sport-specific fields encompassing at least 2.5 acres for each credit.
(2)
Swimming pool - Swimming pools shall include at least 1,250 square feet of pool surface and 2,000 square feet of deck area for each 50 dwelling units served in the development. Restrooms, showers, and changing areas are required.
(3)
Sports courts - These may consist of tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball courts, multi-purpose courts or similar facilities encompassing 40,000 square feet for each one-half credit.
(4)
Picnic areas - These may consist of independent covered picnic tables or shelters accommodating multiple picnic tables. These may abut open spaces but shall not be used to satisfy required open space acreage. At least one acre of land, ten tables, and two restrooms shall be provided for each one-half credit.
(5)
Community activity building - Indoor community activity space may be provided in the amount of 30 square feet per dwelling unit. Restrooms must be included. One credit shall be given for the minimum square footage met.
(6)
Active playground - These may consist of a minimum of 2,400 square feet of play area and play equipment in locations so that each dwelling unit is within one-quarter of a mile of a playground. Each active playground shall, at a minimum, include swings, a slide, climbing apparatus, and a bench, or equivalent recreational amenities as determined by the community development director. One-half credit shall be provided for each active playground.
(d)
Modification of recreational facilities. The community development director may approve minor modifications of recreational facilities approved by the board of commissioners upon finding that the proposed facilities will provide equal or greater recreational value for residents of the development. Any modification deemed by the Director to be major shall require approval of the board of commissioners.
(e)
Major subdivisions—Passive recreational facilities. For major subdivisions with less than 50 dwelling units, the board of commissioners may require passive recreational facilities through the sketch plat or preliminary development plan approval process if the board of commissioners determines that based on location of the subdivision (i.e., distance to recreational facilities, and/or the integration of the required open space into the overall development) fails to provide sufficient recreational opportunities for the residents.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Secs. 114-646—114-659. - Reserved.
DIVISION 8. - SIGNS
This division of the UDO shall be referred to as the sign code of Bryan County or sign code.

Sec. 114-660. - Purposes.
(a)
It is not the intent of this sign code to regulate the message that signs convey, to foreclose important and distinct mediums or expression for political, religious, or personal messages, or to suggest the county should regulate the content of signs in any manner. It is, however, the intent of this chapter to regulate the time, place, and manner of sign placement in a manner sufficient to meet the public purposes articulated in this section.
(b)
These sign regulations are intended to:
(1)
To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the county;
(2)
To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment;
(3)
To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions;
(4)
To maintain the county's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public;
(5)
To protect the rural character of the county;
(6)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the county by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with its compatibility with the aesthetic, public health, safety and welfare concerns that the county is charged by law and the Georgia Constitution with preserving and protecting; and
(7)
To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations while supporting the policies contained in the comprehensive plan.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-661. - Findings.
The board of commissioners finds that:
(a)
Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by provisions of the International Building Code, as adopted by the county. Without sign regulations, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has been long recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs can distract motorists by impairing visibility. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and locations of signs. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs.
(b)
Unregulated signs may negatively affect the character of communities and the value of buildings. For example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public because they compete with public purpose signs and reduce their visibility and effectiveness. Unregulated signage in special character areas would almost assuredly neutralize any public plan and investments to improve streetscapes.
(c)
Sign regulation serves the interests of the business community. Unregulated competition among businesses where individual business signs are not adequately visible results in too many signs and a point of diminishing returns. Sign regulations help to maintain the scenic heritage and unique character of the community by implementing uniformity of standards and quality in signs. Signs substantially influence the appearance of the community, and sign regulation is essential to the community's long-term economic viability. Sign controls improve visual character.
(d)
Signs are a proper use of private property, a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. However, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public.
(e)
Effective sign regulation lessens hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic.
(f)
Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment.
(g)
Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the county will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business.
(h)
Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues, as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech, are reasonably promoted in the county by the provisions of these sign regulations. Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this UDO, the provisions of this sign code are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-662. - Applicability.
(a)
The regulations and requirements of this sign code apply to all signs that are or are intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way or adjacent property, or to be viewed from outdoor areas of private property, except as otherwise exempt under this sign code.
(b)
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the planning jurisdiction of the county only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this UDO. Section 114-422 establishes the procedures to permit a variety of types of signs in commercial, residential and industrial areas that are subject to the standards of this sign code, which:
(1)
Exempts certain signs as specifically provided;
(2)
Prohibits certain types of signs;
(3)
Identifies signs that may be permitted in various locations and circumstances;
(4)
Establishes standards for the design of signs generally and within specified zoning districts;
(5)
Establishes rules for sign measurement and maintenance and;
(6)
Describes how non-conforming signs should be addressed and the rules for sign removal.

( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-668. - Sign measurement.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
(a)
Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the wiring, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall.
(b)
Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(c)
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade of the sign is lower than the grade of the adjacent public street, normal grade shall be construed to be the grade of the adjacent public street. The term "adjacent public street" shall mean the street providing approved vehicle access to the property and which does or would bear the street address for the property.
(d)
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area. To determine the maximum sign area, the total square footage for every sign on the parcel, including freestanding, wall signs, projecting, and window signs, shall calculated. Maximum total sign area shall comply with the zoning district standard.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-669. - Sign maintenance.
(a)
Every sign, including those signs for which permits are required and those for which no permits or permit fees are required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable and good structural condition at all times, including repair or replacement of defective parts, painting, repainting, cleaning and other acts required for the maintenance of the sign.
(b)
To prevent rust, peeling, flaking, fading, or rotting, all signs and supports shall be painted, unless anodized or similarly treated.
(c)
Broken panels, missing letters, defective illumination, torn fabric, flaking or peeling paint and other damage to a sign, shall be replaced or repaired.
(d)
If determination is made by the county that any sign is unsafe, not secure, in violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.
