DIVISION 20. - VIDEO STORES

Sec. 12-670. - Purpose.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Lawrenceville, Georgia, the Mayor and Council take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities, including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films or videos depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the Mayor and Council further note that persons frequent such video booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths.
(b)
The Mayor and Council find that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The Mayor and Council therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in video stores be removed and that no doors or holes be allowed to exist between or on adjoining booths. The Mayor and Council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in video stores. The Mayor and Council further find that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To those ends, this division is hereby adopted.
