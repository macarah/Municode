(3)
Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.0 or in excess of 10.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment.
(4)
Any wastewater which results in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems or containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, whether singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to, section 307(a) of the Act.
(5)
Pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW.
(6)
Wastewater having a temperature greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) at the introduction into the POTW or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference.
(7)
Trucked or hauled pollutants including septic tank waste, except at discharge points and at such times designated by the director of utilities. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director of utilities or his designated representative and the city may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Such waste shall not violate provisions of this article or other requirements established by the city. The director of utilities shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits and may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director of utilities may also prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall also identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous waste.
(8)
Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving stream water quality standards.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2074)
Sec. 98-275. - Limited discharges.
(a)
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the director of utilities that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving system, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the director of utilities will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
(1)
Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(2)
Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharge to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.

The director of utilities may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of the concentration-based limitations of this subsection.
(b)
Prior to the adoption of the 1996 revisions of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the city has issued permits to several existing users whose historical discharge of BOD, total suspended solids and/or ammonia exceed the concentration limits of this section. The director of utilities may renew these existing permits provided that the existing mass load of pollutants from any of these individual industries shall not increase above the historic average and that the discharge shall not cause a cumulative overload on a particular basin.
Sec. 98-277. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405โ471 are hereby incorporated.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass of the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of utilities may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of utilities shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2076)

Sec. 98-280. - Excessive discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with discharge limitations unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director of utilities may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2080)
Sec. 98-281. - Accidental discharges.
Each user shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own costs and expense. At least once every two years, the director of utilities shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the city of any accidental or slug discharge; and
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and control of plant runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
Review and approval of such plans and procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2081)
Sec. 98-282. - Written notice.
Within five days following an accidental discharge the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2082)
Sec. 98-283. - Notice to employees.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2083)
Sec. 98-284. - Flow equalization.
(a)
The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes in volumes, or with constituents, such that existing dilution conditions in the sewers or at the treatment plant would be affected to the detriment of the city, shall be subject to review and approval of the director of utilities. When necessary in the opinion of the director of utilities, pretreatment or equalizing units may be required to bring constituents or volume of flow within the limits previously prescribed or to an otherwise acceptable level, and to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow conditions may hamper the operation of any unit of the sewer system. The equalization or holding unit shall have a capacity suitable to serve the intended purpose and be equipped with acceptable outlet control facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing conditions in the waste flow.
(b)
Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained at the user's expense. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(Code 1976, ยง 5-2084)
Sec. 98-285. - Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
(a)
Generally. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of fats, grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.
