ARTICLE VIII. - WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
DIVISION 1. - LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 26-274. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to reduce discretionary outdoor water use and avoid wasting water by adopting more efficient irrigation system design requirements.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-275. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Flow sensor means an inline device that produces a repeatable signal proportional to flow rate.
Landscape means ground cover, trees, shrubs, and other plants.
Landscape irrigation system means an assembly of component parts that is permanently installed for the controlled distribution of water to irrigate landscapes.
Large landscape means the landscape areas associated with a development (excluding single-family homes) served by one or more landscape irrigation systems where all irrigated areas added together total more than one acre (or 43,560 square feet).
Master shut-off valve means an automatic valve such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve capable of being automatically closed by the WaterSense controller. When this valve is closed water will not be supplied to the landscape irrigation system.
Rain sensor shut-off means an electric device that detects and measures rainfall amounts and overrides the cycle of a landscape irrigation system so as to turn off such system when a predetermined amount of rain has fallen.
WaterSense controller means weather-based irrigation controllers labeled under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense program, which includes standalone controllers, add-on devices, and plug-in devices that use current weather data as a basis for scheduling irrigation.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-276. - Applicability and exceptions.
The article applies to all landscape irrigation systems except those (a) used for commercial agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, (b) used for golf courses, and (c) dependent upon a nonpublic water source.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-277. - Avoiding water waste through design.
All landscape irrigation systems shall be designed, installed, maintained, and operated to prevent runoff from leaving the target landscape due to low-head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways, parking lots, or structures. This requirement helps ensure compliance with, and is in addition to, the Gwinnett County Water System more general prohibitions against water waste.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-278. - General landscape irrigation system requirements.
Regardless of whether an irrigation meter is used, all new landscape irrigation systems for single family residences shall include the following:
(1)
A backflow prevention assembly if required by the applicable backflow prevention requirements;
(2)
A WaterSense controller; and
(3)
A rain sensor shut-off installed in an area that is unobstructed by trees, roof over hangs, or anything else that might block rain from triggering the rain sensor shutoff.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-279. - Large landscape irrigation system requirements.
Regardless of whether an irrigation meter is used, new landscape irrigation systems for large landscapes shall include the following:
(1)
Applicable backflow prevention, a WaterSense controller, and the rain sensor shut-off as required of all new landscape irrigation systems;
(2)
A master shut-off valve for each controller installed as close as possible to the point of connection of the water but downstream of the backflow prevention assembly;
(3)
Pressure-regulating devices such as valve pressure regulators, sprinkler head pressure regulators, inline pressure regulators, or other devices shall be installed as needed to achieve the manufacturer's recommended pressure range at the emission devices for optimal performance; and
(4)
At least one flow sensor, which must be installed at or near the supply point of the landscape irrigation system, that when connected to the WaterSense controller will detect and report high flow conditions to such controller and automatically shut master valves.
(Ord. of 6-15-2020)
Sec. 26-280. - Compliance self-certifications for one inch and larger service connections.
All plans for development involving any new service connection of one inch or larger shall include a certification, through written statements in plan documents or on drawings, that the following is true and correct:
(1)
The development will not include any landscape irrigation systems;
(2)
The development will include a landscape irrigation system that does not serve a large landscape, and as a result the system will only include applicable backflow prevention, a WaterSense controller, and the rain sensor shut-off; or
(3)
The development will include a landscape irrigation system that does serve a large landscape, and as a result all requirements in section 26-279 will be met.
If the certification is not included with all required information, the Gwinnett County Water System shall notify the purchaser specifying what information is missing and ask that documentation with the complete certification be submitted.
Attachment B
Compliance Self-Certifications for New Service Connections of One Inch or Greater
The appropriate plan document or drawing for developments with new connections of one inch or larger must include one of the following:
No landscape irrigation system. This development does not include a landscape irrigation system.
Landscape irrigation system—No large landscape. This development will include a landscape irrigation system that does not serve a large landscape, and as a result the system will include the following: (1) total irrigated landscapes combining all areas is one acre or less, (2) backflow prevention assembly, (3) WaterSense controller, and (4) rain sensor shut-off.
Landscape irrigation system—Large landscape. This development will include a landscape irrigation system that does serve a large landscape, and as a result the system will include: (1) total irrigated landscapes combining all areas is greater than one acre (2) backflow prevention assembly, (3) WaterSense controller, and (4) rain sensor shut-off, (5) master shut-off valve, (6) pressure regulating devices, and (7) flow sensor(s).

DIVISION 2. - NEW CAR WASH REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 26-281. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent.
(1)
The purpose of this article is to reduce water consumption from commercial car wash facilities by requiring all new conveyor car washes to install operational recycled water systems.
(b)
Applicability.
(1)
This article applies to all new conveyor car washes permitted and constructed after January 1, 2011, regardless of the water source.
