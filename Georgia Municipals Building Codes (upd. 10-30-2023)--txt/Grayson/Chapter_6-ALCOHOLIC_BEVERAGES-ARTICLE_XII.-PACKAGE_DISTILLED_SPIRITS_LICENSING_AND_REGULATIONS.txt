Sec. 6-353. - Package store limit.
(a)
At no time shall the number of licenses issued by the city permitting the retail sale of package distilled spirits within the city limits of the city exceed the number found as a result of dividing the total population of the city, as found in the most recent population estimates published by the United States Bureau of the Census, by the whole number 10,000.
(b)
If the number resulting from the division required by subsection (a) above is a number other than a whole number (for example 1.75) then said number will be adjusted downward to the next whole number where it will remain until the population increases to such an extent which would cause said number to equal or exceed the next higher whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of licenses permitted by this section shall never be less than one.
(c)
The language contained in subsections (a) and (b) of this section can be expressed in the mathematical formula, as follows:
Y ÷ 10,000 = X.
Y is the total population (as defined in subsection (a) above) of the City of Grayson. X is the total number of licenses that can be issued (this number, if not whole, is adjusted downward in accordance with subsection (b) above).

Sec. 6-354. - Both retail sale of package malt beverages and wine and package distilled spirits.
For licensees who wish to operate a business which conducts both the retail sale of package distilled spirits and the retail sale of package malt beverages and wine, in the case of conflict, the provisions of this article regulating the retail sale of package distilled spirits shall prevail, and compliance with those provisions, rather than the provisions applicable to the license permitting the retail sale of package malt beverages and wine, is required.

Sec. 6-355. - License, administrative, and investigative fee.
Each application for a license under this article shall be accompanied by a certified check for the full amount of the license fee established in section 6-10, together with a separate check or cash in the amount of $500.00 to defray investigative and administrative costs. If the application is denied and the license refused, or if the applicant withdraws the application prior to its being issued, the license fee shall be refunded; but the $500.00 cost paid for investigation shall be retained. However, any person applying for more than one license shall pay only one fee to defray investigative and administrative expenses, which fees shall be the largest of the investigative and administrative fees authorized under this code. Any applicant for a license under this article who is in existence at the time of making the new application and has an existing valid license under this chapter shall pay no investigative and administrative costs.
