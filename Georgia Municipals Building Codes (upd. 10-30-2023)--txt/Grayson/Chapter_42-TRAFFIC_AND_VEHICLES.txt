ARTICLE II. - SPEED TABLES

Sec. 42-8. - Definitions.
(a)
Council. The city council of Grayson, Georgia.
(b)
Speed tables. The construction of an asphaltic geometric design installed on streets to address speeding problems on streets that are classified as local residential streets.
(c)
MUTCD (The Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices). A publication that provides standards for traffic signage and other devices.
(d)
Local residential street. A paved road having residences on both sides that lies entirely within the city limits of Grayson, Georgia. A local residential street must intersect one other street; therefore, portions of longer streets may be considered as eligible for speed tables.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-9. - Purpose.
In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems on residential streets, the City of Grayson has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other communities and how effectively those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed tables was found to be a popular and relatively cost-effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed tables were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods.
They are therefore found to be of public interest and benefit and are hereby authorized in the City of Grayson.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-10. - Criteria for installation.
The City of Grayson will consider the installation of speed tables only on streets classified as local residential streets, unless otherwise initiated by the city as provided in section 42-14.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-11. - Request for study; public hearing.
An authorized officer of an organized homeowner's association or the majority of homeowners on a local residential street may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a street be studied for speed table installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners are represented. The speed table study will be performed by a city-selected traffic consultant. Based on the results of the study, the city can determine the severity of the speeding problem and the appropriate solutions for this location. The results of the speed table study may be directed to the petition representative by certified mail, or upon request, will be presented by the council at an advertised public hearing with a general presentation on speed tables. All property owners affected shall be notified by an authorized representative of the petition group of the time and place of the public hearing. Property owners will be notified that the installation of speed tables may reduce emergency response time by ten seconds for each hump installed.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-12. - Preparation of the petition.
A formal petition in such form prescribed by the council shall be filed with the council requesting the speed tables be installed on a local residential street. All property owners on the street shall be notified by an authorized representative of the petition group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his or her preference for the installation of the speed hump(s) by marking a "YES" or "NO" on the petition. If more than one person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature shall be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the council. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-13. - Number of signatures required.
A minimum of 75 percent of the properties on a local residential street must indicate an affirmative preference for the speed hump(s). Determining the number of properties on a local residential street shall be established by the council using the database of the city's taxing authorities.
In the event a street is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total number of residences on a street must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed tables will be considered.
The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the petition group, and it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the council where it will be checked to ensure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented at the next regular city council meeting for approval or disapproval by the mayor and council.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-14. - City initiated petitions and speed tables.
The city council may initiate the gathering of petitions on local residential streets, or may undertake at expense to the general public, the installation, maintenance, and/or removal of speed tables on its rights-of-way or other city-owned properties, when such are found to be in the general public interest and for the purpose of the general health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-15. - Construction of speed tables, warning posted.
The geometric design of speed tables has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speed. Based on extensive research, speed tables shall be constructed with the following specifications:
(1)
Four inches maximum vertical rise and 22 feet in horizontal length with a six-foot incline, ten-foot flat-top, and a six-foot decline.
(2)
Each individual speed table location shall require posting of "residential speed control district" and MUTCD W17-1 standard "speed hump" warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the city-owned right-of-way. The "residential speed control district" signs shall be posted on ends of local streets and/or at the entrance of subdivisions, as the case may dictate.
(3)
At the discretion of the city, speed tables may be located in intersections as a means of controlling pedestrian crossings and slowing traffic turning. In these instances, the speed table may be modified in design to meet the requirements of the intersection.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-16. - Procedure for removal.
Other than as described in section 42-14 above, the city shall remove speed tables only under the following conditions:
(1)
A formal petition in the form prescribed in section 42-12 above shall be filed with the council indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed tables. In the event the local residential street is not completely built-out, a minimum of 60 percent of the number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the removal of speed tables will be considered;
(2)
The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds on their street may increase after the speed tables are removed; and
(3)
The speed tables shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
Sec. 42-17. - Charges for installation and removal of speed tables.
The property owner's portion of the charges associated with the installation and removal of speed tables shall be at a level that adequately covers 75 percent of the direct and indirect costs as determined by the council. All rates may be subject to change to reflect material and labor increases to the city.
All costs associated with the installation or removal of the speed hump as determined and itemized by the council shall have been paid in full prior to work being performed by the city.
(Ord. of 6-17-2019)
