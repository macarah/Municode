For other false alarms separated by more than 24 hours, no fines shall be assessed to a business or residence for the first three false alarms, at the same alarm panel location responded to by the fire department during period of 12 consecutive calendar months. For every subsequent preventable false alarm that occurs at the same premises within a period of 12 consecutive calendar months, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of up to $250.00. If the responsible person(s) for the property at which an alarm occurs fail to provide one or more current key holders, a fee of up to $100.00 will be assessed against the person(s) responsible for the property. If a key holder refuses to respond when requested by the fire department, a fine of up to $250.00 will be assessed against the person(s) responsible for the property, and the responsible person(s) for the property are liable for any damages and costs, of incidents or emergencies that may occur within or to their property, and/or to any other impacted property.

Absent other infractions, the first two such alarms will be documented but not counted in the incidents that activate citations in accordance with subsection (a).
