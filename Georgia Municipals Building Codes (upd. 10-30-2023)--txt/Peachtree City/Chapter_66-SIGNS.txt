ARTICLE I. - GENERAL

Sec. 66-1. - Purpose.
The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to maintain and attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. This sign chapter is adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance.
Specifically, the mayor and city council find that:
(1)
Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly, and safely designed business environment.
(2)
An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public.
(3)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion, and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic control signs, and devices.
(4)
Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage, and that impedes the flow of information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians.
(5)
Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth.
(6)
Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic wellbeing of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business.
(7)
Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intend by enacting this chapter to:
a.
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
b.
Further, the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan;
c.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city;
d.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
e.
Maintain the image of the city, particularly the planned community nature of the city;
f.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
g.
Promote economic development; and
h.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(8)
While specifically establishing regulations to control signs within the city, it is not the intent of this chapter to regulate:
a.
Art and art symbols;
b.
Holiday decorations and symbols.
(9)
The city recognizes the need for certain types of signs which facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic. This chapter provides for the regulation of incidental address identification, subdivision identification signs, building identifier signs, multi-tenant building directory signs and directional signs as necessary to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic looking for a specific destination and to provide for the prompt response of emergency personnel to calls for service.
(10)
Recognizing the historical contribution of certain structures and places to the cultural fabric of the city and the need and desire to identify same, certain provisions are made in this chapter to allow for the identification of those structures and places.
(11)
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other structures throughout the city.
(12)
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents, and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this chapter.

For signs shared by more than one person or entity, the owner or sign contractor shall secure a permit for the sign structure and the owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the structure as well as for removal of individual sign panels utilized by businesses which no longer exist within the building or buildings covered by the shared sign. In addition to the permit required for a shared sign structure, a separate permit shall be required for each panel, which shall be obtained by the owner, his tenant, an authorized agent, or the sign contractor.
(d)
Fees for permits shall be as fixed from time to time by the city council.
(e)
Upon the filing of an application for a permit and the payment of all necessary fees, the city planner shall examine all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected. Such review shall be completed within 30 days of submission of a sign application. If it appears from review of the permit application and the site that the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the city planner shall issue a permit no later than 30 days from receipt of the completed application. The decision to issue the permit may be communicated by email to the applicant. If the city planner determines an application is incomplete or not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the city planner shall issue a denial letter within the same 30-day period as provided by subsection (g). Within the 30-day review period, the city planner may seek additional clarifications or modifications of the application that fail to meet current standards. Such communications may be by email, provided that a final determination of denial shall be made within 30 days from date of submission and shall be in accordance with subsection (g).
(f)
For those signs containing electrical components, the applicant must secure appropriate electrical permits from the city's building department and call for an inspection prior to illuminating the sign.

Denial of permit. The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete, or contain any false material statements.

Should the city planner deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by first class mail to the address on the permit application on or before 30 days after the city received the application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission.
No permit shall be revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined, and after the applicant is given ten days written notice containing a statement of the reasons for the proposed revocation of a permit. "Due cause" is the violation of any provision of this chapter, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements.
(h)
Appeals. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the city council, provided such appellant files a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the city planner's notice. Such appeal shall be considered by the city council at the next city council meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that such notice of appeal is received a minimum of five business days before the next meeting. Appeal notices received within five days of a scheduled city council meeting shall be heard at the next available meeting more than five days following receipt of appeal. The city council's review and decision shall be based on all standards of this chapter. The city council shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 days following the close of the appeal hearing. Decisions of the city council to affirm the decision of the city planner or to overrule the decision of the city planner and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation. Such decision shall constitute a final determination by the city.
In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or a permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the city council, such applicant or permit holder may appeal such decision via a petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law.
(i)
Double permit fees. Any person commencing work on a sign before securing the necessary permit from the city planner shall be subject to double permit fees under the permit fee schedule.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
Sec. 66-8. - Expiration of sign permit.
A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and installed within three months after the date the permit was issued. No refunds will be made of permit fees for permits that expire due to failure to erect a permitted sign; provided that where an applicant can demonstrate that a commercial entity was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed, one 90-day extension may be granted by the city planner on the duration of the permit. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign, if an individual later desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed, and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of resubmission.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
Sec. 66-9. - Display of permit.
The owner of the sign shall be responsible for maintaining the permit for every sign approved, erected or maintained for which a permit is required by this chapter. The city planner shall inspect each sign following its installation to ensure the sign is installed in accordance with the approved sign permit. Once it is determined the sign complies with said permit, a decal shall be affixed to the actual sign or to the entrance door of the place of business indicating the sign has been approved. The purpose of this decal shall be to notify city officers and employees that the sign complies with the provisions of this chapter and the approved sign permit application.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
Sec. 66-10. - Compliance with technical codes and zoning.
All signs hereafter erected, replaced, reconstructed, altered, relocated or modified within the city shall conform with the physical requirements of the city's building code in effect on the date the application for a sign permit is submitted, the requirements of the National Electrical Code, and the requirements of all other applicable codes as adopted by the city. Where the provisions of the building or electrical code and this chapter conflict or overlap, the most stringent requirement shall prevail and be controlling, provided that the provisions governing issuance, denial, or revocation of permits, appeals and variances set forth in this chapter are exclusive and no such permit, appeal or variance requirements found in a technical code shall apply within the city as to signs.
All signs hereafter erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered or relocated within the city shall conform to the zoning ordinance of the city. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the zoning ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail and be controlling.

Sec. 66-16. - Computation of sign area.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area for monument and wall signs:
(1)
Monument signs. The area of a monument sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign face modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face and are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature.
The supports or structure upon which the sign face is located shall not be included in determining the overall size of the monument sign unless they are designed in a manner to form an integral part of the display and the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display is no greater than 100 percent of the area of the sign displayed, and provided that no part of the monument sign is higher than five feet.
Double-sided signs with parallel, opposing faces shall not exceed 18 inches in width as measured from sign face to sign face. Only one face of a double-faced sign and bearing identical copy shall be used to compute the overall sign area.
(2)
Wall signs. The area of a wall sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign face modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face and are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign face module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign face module, or sign structure.
(3)
Computation of sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
a.
Existing grade prior to construction; or
b.
The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower.
The maximum height of monument signs shall be no greater than five feet.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
Sec. 66-17. - Signs permitted within the public right-of-way.
(a)
No signs shall be allowed in the public rights-of-way, private rights-of-way and/or railroad rights-of-way except for the following:

This cost shall be the same as that established by city council for a sign permit application submittal fee.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
Sec. 66-18. - Temporary permits.
(a)
In addition to signs otherwise permitted in this chapter, properties in commercial, office and industrial districts wishing to erect temporary signs and devices including portable signs and spectacular signs and devices, may do so only by obtaining a permit under the following conditions and requirements:
(1)
Application. Prior to display of a temporary sign, an application for a permit shall be filed with the city planner. One permit shall be issued to cover all signs and devices during the period of permit coverage. Handling of permit requests shall conform to section 66-7. All signs and devices to be covered by the permit shall be specifically described as to their construction and/ or composition and location on the business premises.

(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)
ARTICLE V. - ENFORCEMENT AND SIGN REMOVAL PROCEDURES

Sec. 66-22. - Inspection.
The city planner or code enforcement officer or other designated city officials shall periodically inspect each permanent and temporary conforming and non-conforming sign for the purpose of ascertaining whether the same is secure or insecure, whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and whether it is in need of repair.
In addition to these inspections, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall cause to be removed any sign that falls under the following classifications:
(1)
Traffic hazards. Any sign constituting a traffic hazard or a menace to the motoring public or pedestrians, as determined by the city planner or code enforcement officer in consultation with the chief of police, shall be removed as provided herein.
(2)
General maintenance. Every sign, including those signs for which permits are required and those for which no permits or permit fees are required shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and good structural condition at all times. The sign owner shall be responsible for repair or replacement of defective parts, painting, repainting, cleaning, and other acts required for the maintenance of the sign. If the sign is not made to comply with adequate safety and maintenance standards, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall require its removal in accordance herein.
(3)
Abandoned signs. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any sign that is located on property that becomes vacant and unoccupied for a period of one month or longer, including any tenant in a multi-tenant commercial, office, or industrial structure, or any sign which pertains to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies, shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Permanent signs applicable to a business suspended because of a change of ownership or management of such business shall not be deemed abandoned unless the property remains vacant for a period of six months or more. Sign panels from abandoned signs shall be removed by the owner of the premises on which the sign is located within the time frame specified in this subsection. The supporting structure of an abandoned sign shall be subject to the non-conforming use provisions herein.
(4)
Dangerous or defective signs. No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises owned or controlled by that person any sign that is in a dangerous or defective condition. Any such sign shall be removed or repaired by the owner of the premises or owner of the sign. Upon failure of the owner to remove or repair a dangerous or defective sign, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall proceed as described herein.
(5)
Unlawful signs. No person shall erect or permit to be erected any sign that does not comply with the provisions of this chapter.
The city planner or code enforcement officer shall prepare a written notice that shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved. The notice shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within ten business days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
All notices by the city planner or code enforcement officer shall be personally served or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date received if hand delivered or otherwise on the date delivered as shown upon the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service.
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign, and the occupant of the property. If any such person is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
Any person having an interest in the sign, or the property may appeal the determination of the city planner or code enforcement officer ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city council within ten business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be handled as provided in section 66-7.
If the person to whom notice is directed fails to take corrective action within the time period prescribed, or if on appeal the city council affirms the decision of the city planner or code enforcement officer and the person fails to take corrective action or remove the offending sign within the time period prescribed, then the city planner or code enforcement officer shall proceed to have the sign removed or corrected to bring such sign into compliance with this chapter or to remove any unsafe condition.
When it is determined by the city planner or code enforcement officer that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety and contact cannot be made with the sign order or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served prior to removal. In such emergency situation, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall document the unsafe condition and may correct the danger, with all costs being charged to the sign owner or the property owner.
If it shall be necessary for the city planner or code enforcement officer to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the city planner or code enforcement officer may sell or salvage any material derived in the removal. He may sell the same at public or private sale at the best price obtainable and keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the cost of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known or if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for benefit of the owner for a period of three years. At the end of three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become the property the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the costs of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located. Such lien shall be collectable in the same manner as city property taxes.
Any sign removed by the city planner or code enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removable shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign removal.
(Ord. No. 1196 , § 1, 3-3-2022)

Where visibility of a conforming sign from the proposed street and within 50 feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot; and
(2)
Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction; and
(3)
Such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property; and
(4)
The variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to vehicular traffic or pedestrians as determined by the city engineer.
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variances shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist.
Relief from the application of the provisions of this chapter by use of variances granted by the city council shall be granted only upon a finding of hardship as previously defined.
