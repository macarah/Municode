Sec. 1301. - Administrative authority.
These land development regulations shall be administered by the city planner and other city staff members, along with the planning commission for the city council.
(Ord. No. 936, § 1, 2-21-2008)
Sec. 1302. - Variance.
A variance is a request for relief from the provisions of the land development ordinance. The purpose of this section is to authorize variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
An application for a variance may be submitted only by the owner of the property for which a variance is desired or his authorized agent. Application requirements shall be as described herein.
Variances shall only be granted upon showing that:
(a)
Relief, if granted, would be in harmony with, or, could be made to be in harmony with, the general purpose and intent of the land development ordinance; or
(b)
The application of the particular provision of the land development ordinance to a particular piece of property, due to extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to that property because of its size, shape, or topography, would create an unnecessary hardship for the owner while causing no detriment to the public.
(Ord. No. 936, § 1, 2-21-2008)
Sec. 1303. - Review criteria.
In reviewing a request for a variance, the city council shall not grant the request unless all of the following findings can be made:
(a)
There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, or topography so that the strict application of this ordinance denies the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning district classification;
(b)
The strict or literal interpretation and application of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the land development ordinance, or would deprive the applicant of privileges granted to others in similar circumstances;
(c)
There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or the intended development of the property which preclude the applicant from complying with this ordinance and that do not apply generally to other property in the same zoning district and which prevent the applicant from complying with existing regulations;
(d)
The granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other property in the same zoning district; and
(e)
The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which the property is located.
(f)
The granting of such variance will not create inconsistencies with any objective of the comprehensive plan.
If it is found that the request is not in conformance with these requirements or may possibly have an adverse effect on the surrounding area, the city council shall deny the request in writing, stating the reasons for the denial.
(Ord. No. 936, § 1, 2-21-2008)
Sec. 1304. - Filing procedure.
All variance applications shall be filed with the zoning administrator on forms provided by the zoning administrator.
Any communication relative to a variance request will be regarded as information only until a proper application is made in the form required.
An application fee, as established within the city's schedule of fees, shall accompany each variance application.
Upon receiving an application, the zoning administrator shall have no less than ten working days to review the application for compliance with these requirements. Once the application is deemed complete, the zoning administrator shall schedule a public hearing with the city council. Such hearings shall take place within 45 days after the application is deemed complete.
A sign displaying the hearing date and the nature of the hearing shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the property not less than 15 calendar days prior to a city council meeting, as appropriate.
A notice of the public hearing date and the nature of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation which serves as the legal organ for the city. The newspaper notice shall appear not less than 15 calendar days prior to a city council meeting.
At the public hearing, the applicant may appear in person or be represented by an agent or attorney.
(Ord. No. 936, § 1, 2-21-2008)
Sec. 1305. - Limitations on authority.
The authority and jurisdiction of individuals as provided herein shall be limited as outlined in the following. In exercising this jurisdiction, each individual shall have authority to determine whether it has jurisdiction.
There shall be no modification to revise a site plan that, as determined by the planning commission and/or city council, results in a significant change in the approved concept.
(Ord. No. 936, § 1, 2-21-2008)
Sec. 1306. - Appeal procedures.
Appeals to the city council based on decisions of the city planner and/or planning commission shall be filed with the city clerk in writing and shall clearly specify the grounds for the appeal. All documents constituting the record of the action which is being appealed shall be transmitted to the city council by the city clerk.
Sufficient information shall be provided by the applicant, affected city staff members, and the planning commission to ensure a timely decision by the city council.

For purposes of this section, an interested party shall be an applicant or a city resident who lives within 300 feet of the proposed subdivision or development at issue on appeal.
