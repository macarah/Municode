Sec. 701. - Purpose and intent.
The review and approval of site plans, building design, landscaping, site lighting and signage for all new developments and the re-development of existing properties should achieve and maintain high quality and appearance that will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area and will uphold and promote high quality development throughout the city.
Site planning and design of projects proposed adjacent to different land uses should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns.
Specifically, the intent of this article is as follows:
(a)
To encourage high quality appearance for all developments on major and minor thoroughfares throughout the city;
(b)
To provide proper standards that ensure a high quality appearance for the city, and promote good design while also allowing individuality, creativity, and artistic expression;
(c)
To encourage the proper use of the land by promoting an appropriate balance between the built environment and the preservation or conservation of open space;
(d)
To preserve and improve property values and protect private and public investment; and
(e)
To preserve and protect the identity and character of the city and to enhance the business economy.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
DIVISION 1. - STANDARDS FOR SITE DESIGN

Sec. 702. - Protecting the natural environment.
Prior to preparation and submittal of a site plan, the applicant should evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development. To the greatest extent practicable, the site plan shall be prepared in a manner that will conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Development of each site should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment.
Existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 703. - Access.
The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, shall be considered in formulating and approving access plans. Interparcel site access, for pedestrians, golf carts and vehicles, should be provided to adjacent properties when land uses are compatible. Common access easements for shared driveways along state highways and busy streets are strongly encouraged.
If at all feasible with the development plan, service functions (e.g., deliveries, maintenance activities) shall be integrated into the circulation pattern in a manner that minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians. Commercial and industrial developments should have service and loading areas separate from main circulation and parking areas.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 704. - Grading plan.
Developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork. Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged.
Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is strongly discouraged. Every effort should be made to avoid the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts. The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Where this is not possible, the walls shall be finished in a manner that is compatible with the exterior of the building and screened with landscaping. Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 705. - Fences and walls.
The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and should use similar building materials. All walls or fences 50 feet in length or longer, and four feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony by changing plane, height, material or material texture, or significant landscape massing.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 706. - Multi-use paths.
The planning commission shall require multi-use paths in order to facilitate pedestrian and golf cart access from residential and commercial developments to schools, parks, playgrounds and other city amenities via the multi-use path system. If, at the time of conceptual approval, there are no completed multi-use paths to which the multi-use paths of the proposed developer can be linked, the planning commission shall require that the developer, in lieu of installing the multi-use paths, dedicate the easements and deposit a cash payment with the city council equal to the cost of installing the multi-use paths. This cost shall be determined by the city engineer. Such deposit shall be placed in a multi-use path construction fund to be established by the city council. When the multi-use system is extended to the boundary of the development, the city council will use the deposit to construct the multi-use paths in the development.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 707. - Utility lines.
All utility lines within the city shall be placed underground with the following exceptions:
(1)
Those lines which were in place above ground prior to May 21, 1987;
(2)
Those lines, temporary in nature, which are intended to provide immediate service to an area for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to the approval of the city engineer;
(3)
Major transmission lines which do not provide service to adjoining properties, but are intended to distribute service between substations, subject to the approval of the city engineer; and
(4)
When an electric distribution line already exists overhead on, adjacent to, or across the street from a piece of property zoned for industrial use, that line may be extended overhead to the industrial property provided the overhead line extension is placed underground at the closest feasible point to the property line and does not attach directly to any structure on the property; and
(5)
Underground utility lines being installed, relocated or upgraded within the city shall be located in accordance with standard drawings 303 and 304 in the "DESIGN STANDARDS" section at the rear of the [this] land development ordinance. Those utilities being placed along publicly owned and maintained rights-of-way shall follow drawing number 303. Those utilities being placed along privately owned and maintained streets shall follow drawing number 304. Exceptions may be granted by the city engineer with the concurrence of the utility company or companies involved.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 707.1. - Marking standards for underground utilities.
I.
Definitions. The following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article:
(a)
Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action.
(b)
Extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article. Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God.
II.
White lining.
(a)
Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate.
(c)
Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining is not an acceptable or recognized method.
(d)
Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows:
(1)
Unless one or more utility facilities are damaged five times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GPSC Rule 515-9-4-.13 (a copy of GPSC Rule 515-9-4-.13 currently in effect is attached as Exhibit "A" and by this reference is incorporated herein). A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the Large Project Marking Facility Locating Agreement Schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon;
(2)
Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining;
(3)
"Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section;
(4)
Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and
(5)
Termite baiting systems.
(e)
White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points.
(f)
Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both.
III.
Facility marking by or for utilities.
(a)
Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 24 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(1)
To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner.
(2)
The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks.
(3)
Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet.
(4)
The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area.
(5)
In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks.
(6)
Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows:
(7)
Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy.
(8)
Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover).
(9)
Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner.
(10)
Unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral.
(11)
When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines:
(12)
If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches.
(13)
Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot.
(14)
In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow.
(15)
In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit".

This subsection 707.2-2 shall not apply to a utility currently providing services in the city that is exempted by this section, state or federal law, an existing valid right-of-way agreement, franchise agreement other than a state-wide franchise agreement authorized by O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-76-4, or other service agreement whereby a process for permitting the construction or extension of facilities in the rights-of-way has been established with the city or an existing state cable service or video service franchise or a state telecommunications franchise. A utility that is not exempted by this section, state or federal law, or an existing agreement who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this section, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, shall file a registration statement with the city within 90 days of the effective date of this section.
(b)
A utility which is registering with the city under this section for the first time shall pay a registration fee in accordance with the city's fee schedule. This registration fee shall not apply to a utility which is operating within the city as of January 1, 2016.
(c)
The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to:
(1)
The name, legal status (i.e., partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant").

When procedure contained in (a) above would yield less than four acres, the commission may require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of the subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as adjacent land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than two acres be reserved for recreation purposes.
(c)
Alternative procedure.
(1)
Money in lieu of land. Where, with respect to a particular single-family subdivision or multifamily development, the reservation of land required pursuant to this section does not equal the percentage of total land required to be reserved, the city shall require, prior to preliminary plat or final site plan approval, that the applicant deposit with the city clerk a cash payment in lieu of land reservation. Such deposit shall be used by the city for improvement of neighborhood park, playground, or recreation areas including the future acquisition of property. The planning commission shall determine the amount to be deposited, based on the following formula of $500.00 multiplied by the number of dwelling units proposed for the residential development less a credit for the amount of land actually reserved for recreation purposes, if any; as the land reserved bears in proportion to the land required for reservation.
(2)
Public facility in lieu of land and/or money.
a.
A facility (e.g., passive park, playground, swimming pool, tennis courts, ball field, etc.) may be constructed in lieu of the designated land requirements as determined by this section. Such facilities must be of equal or greater value than the designated requirements, and must be approved by the city council.
b.
Facilities constructed in greenbelt areas may qualify for partial credit of land in lieu of money. The following credits shall be permitted:
1.
Greenbelts required by this articleâ€”No credit.
2.
Greenbelts with cart pathsâ€”One-third credit.
3.
Greenbelts with cart paths, including improvements such as: picnic tables, picnic grills, picnic shelters, etc.â€”Two-thirds credit.
4.
Greenbelt areas that include larger recreational areas (e.g., the three recreation ponds in Braelinn Village)â€”Full credit.
In order to receive any credit for cart paths in any greenbelt area, the cart path must extend over or through a minimum of 75 percent of the greenbelt area measured along the longest boundary.
Acceptance of the proposed public greenbelts by the planning commission will be a condition of final plat or final site plan approval. The developer shall complete the greenbelt improvements within an appropriate and reasonable time period established between the developer and the planning commission but in no event later than one year after final plat or final site plan approval.
(d)
Recreation needs. A developer who is developing a portion of his holdings may propose an overall plan for recreation needs. The planning commission shall review the plan. If the plan conforms to the intent and purpose of this article, the planning commission may accept the plan as the recreational need plan for the designated area. As the developer develops portions of the designated area, he shall submit a letter describing how he is satisfying the requirements of the plan.
(e)
Notes. If the land to be reserved is located other than shown on the final plat, then appropriate notes as to size, location and other identifying data shall be shown on the final plat being approved.
(f)
Other recreation reservations.
(1)
The provisions of this section are minimum standards. None of the paragraphs above shall be construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation purposes in addition to that required by this section.
(2)
When subdivisions or developers provide private recreational areas and facilities, partial credit may be given to meet the requirements set forth in this section. The planning commission will apply the formula described in section 705(c)(1) ($500.00 per dwelling unit) on an equal basis with the private facility subject to a maximum of one-half credit of total amount required by the formula of $500.00 per dwelling unit. The developer shall complete the private recreational facilities within an appropriate and reasonable time period established between the developer and the planning commission but in no event shall the period exceed one year from final plat on final site plan approved.

Sec. 713. - Easements.
Easements, where required, shall have a minimum width of ten feet. The city engineer may require sewer easements in subdivisions not currently served by a sewer system if, in his opinion, the subdivision may some day be served by a sewer system. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement subject to approval by the city engineer.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 714. - Special screening.
Special screening shall be required of all commercial and multifamily subdivisions or developments on the sides that abut streets or single-family residential subdivisions, and the applicable setback areas of multiple frontage lots in single-family residential subdivisions. The intent of this special screening requirement is to hinder the view of the screened structure from the abutting single-family residential subdivision and/or to provide an area between street and commercial area. The area between street and commercial area shall be at least ten feet wide and shall run from property line to property line except for the ingress and egress areas and shall be included on the landscape plan.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 715. - Fire protection.
(a)
Single-family residential developments. Fire hydrants shall be installed in all single-family residential developments that are served by a public water supply at locations shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the fire chief. In no case shall the distance between fire hydrants exceed 600 feet.
(b)
All other developments. Fire hydrants shall be installed in all other developments which are served by a public water supply main, six inches or larger, located in the right-of-way adjacent to the development site. Accessibility for firefighting equipment shall be maintained through all stages of construction. Fire hydrants and water service shall be installed to within 300 feet of the units under construction. If the units are of wood framing, the fire hydrants shall be installed before framing begins. The location and number of fire hydrants shall be approved by the fire chief.

(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 723. - Buffer standards for major thoroughfares.
In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the city has determined that buffer standards need to be adopted and enforced for the property along its major thoroughfares. These standards are intended to promote an orderly development process by setting forth specific standards to be consistently applied to all building sites along major thoroughfares; they are intended to maintain and enhance the aesthetic standards that have already been established as a part of the city's streetscape; they are intended to ameliorate air quality and water runoff problems; they are intended to help reduce traffic congestion and unsafe driving conditions; and they are intended to encourage an orderly pattern of planned development along all the major traffic arteries in the city, as opposed to the sprawl and strip commercial development that typically characterizes unplanned development without proper buffer standards.
The buffer standards have been established for the four main categories of major thoroughfares: arterial highways, community collector roads, village collector roads, and scenic roads. The specific thoroughfares within each of these categories are identified, standards are presented for both residential and nonresidential land uses along the thoroughfares, and special conditions and exceptions are presented for each classification.
723.1 Arterial highways.
There are two arterial highways in Peachtree City: SR 54 and SR 74. The following buffer standards shall apply to all residential and nonresidential development along these highways:
(a)
Residential buffers. A continuous 100-foot-wide (minimum) city-owned greenbelt buffer shall be established for any residential development adjacent to an arterial highway.
(b)
Nonresidential buffers. A continuous 60-foot-wide tree-save/landscape buffer shall be established for any nonresidential development adjacent to an arterial highway.
(c)
Special conditions and exceptions.
(1)
The required tree-save/landscape buffer for any nonresidential property may be reduced as follows, subject to the approval of the city landscape architect and the planning commission:
a.
A buffer may be reduced from 60 feet to 50 feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that amounts to at least ten percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance.
b.
A buffer may be reduced from 60 feet to 40 feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that amounts to at least 20 percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance.
(2)
The buffer requirements for paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to any existing developed lot adjacent to an arterial highway unless the zoning of the property is changed or there is a major change in the intensity of the existing use.

For these lots, the minimum buffer shall be not less than 20 feet wide.
(4)
For any existing platted lot which is adjacent to an arterial highway and which has an average depth of between 200 feet and 220 feet (measured from the right-of-way line of the adjacent arterial highway), the required buffer width may be established at 20 feet plus the number of feet the average depth of the lot exceeds 200 feet. This means that the depth of a buffer for these lots could range from 20 feet minimum to 40 feet maximum.
(5)
The buffer requirements for paragraphs (a) and (b) above may be reduced by ten feet if a nonresidential lot is located between an arterial highway and a parallel service road and if a tree-save/landscape buffer at least 30 feet wide is established adjacent to the service road.
(6)
For lots that front on an arterial highway and have a second or third frontage on another arterial highway, community collector road, village collector road, or scenic road, the respective buffer standards for each of the adjacent major thoroughfares shall apply.

(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
DIVISION 4. - STANDARDS FOR RETAIL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUILDING DESIGN

Sec. 724. - Applicability.
The intent of these standards is to enhance the visual appearance of the community as a whole, as well as the commercial appeal of individual establishments. The mission or intent of this requirement is to adopt design standards which, over time, will establish a streetscape and image that will make the city unique to surrounding jurisdictions, establishes a unifying theme, presents the traveling public with a sense of arrival, is harmonious with its surrounds, is aesthetically pleasing and enhances the character of the community.
As such, the following goals, at a minimum, are established:
(a)
To encourage the rehabilitation/ redevelopment of commercial areas.
(b)
To reinforce and promote the established "village center" planning concept and associated retail and commercial development.
(c)
To facilitate and encourage safe, attractive, and convenient pedestrian circulation and alternate forms of transportation within a development, along a corridor and throughout the community.
(d)
To promote and encourage new development to be compatible in both scale and character with adjoining developments.
(e)
To use landscaping techniques to soften the effect and blend each development with the surrounding areas.
(f)
To further energy conservation and stormwater management through better design.
(g)
To ensure that quality development throughout the city is obtained.
Development or redevelopment of all retail, commercial, office and/or industrial tracts lying within 500 feet of the centerline of SR 74 or SR 54, or within 500 feet of the centerline of any scenic road, community or village collector as defined by this ordinance, shall comply with the requirements of this article.
Each new development and/or changes to existing development located within these areas shall be reviewed by the planning commission for conformance with these guidelines. There shall be no alteration of the existing condition of land, uses, structures, landscaping or lighting within these areas without approval of the planning commission. However, if a proposed development will not be visible from the road once the project is completed, the planning commission may waive review of the development.
The compatible relationship of each development within these areas is of critical public concern for any building or site enhancements. The intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative site planning, engineering, or architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience. The planning commission shall base their review on the guidelines established herein as the sole basis for their review.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 725. - Architectural design.
The design of all structures, walls, fences, signs, light fixtures and accessory buildings shall be unobtrusive and of a design, material and color that blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, and the scale of neighboring architecture, complying with the intent of this section. Innovative, high quality design and development is strongly encouraged to enhance property values and long-term economic assets along designated corridors.
Diversity of architectural design is highly encouraged. However, multiple buildings on the same site or within the same development should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings.
Franchise architecture for single or multiple buildings within a development should be avoided in order to create buildings that complement one another. Franchise architecture is defined as building design that is trademarked or identified with a particular franchise, chain or corporation and is generic or standard in nature. Franchises or national chains should follow the standards of this article to create a building that is compatible with the development in which it is located, utilizing similar architectural design, building materials or color selections to blend in with the surrounding development.
Architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form, size, color, materials, and detailing. The architect should consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process:
(a)
Size (the relationship of the project to its site);
(b)
Scale (the relationship of the building to those around it);
(c)
Massing (the relationship of the building's various parts to each other);
(d)
Fenestration (the placement of windows and doors);
(e)
Rhythm (the relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections);
(f)
Setback (in relation to setback of immediate surroundings);
(g)
Materials (their compatibility with the surrounding developments); and,
(h)
Context (the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings).
Buildings should incorporate alcoves, arcades, awnings, covered walkways, porticoes or roofs that protect pedestrians from the rain and sun. In addition, when appropriate, buildings should incorporate changes in mass, surface, lighting or finish to emphasize entranceways.
Blank walls that can be seen from any street (public or private) are prohibited. Walls shall have offsets, jogs, or other distinctive changes in the building facade. Long or continuous wall planes shall be avoided, particularly in pedestrian activity areas, where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view.
The height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures, especially where buildings will be located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages, such as window lines, should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 726. - Building height and massing.
The height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures, especially where buildings will be located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages, such as window lines, should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings.
The massing of a building can be defined as the overall geometry (length, width and height) of its perceived form. Massing is a significant factor that contributes to establishing the character of a specific building. Of particular importance in defining the massing of a building is the overall height of the form, both actual and perceived, as well as the geometry of the roof.
In order to reduce the apparent bulk of multi-story buildings and maintain pedestrian scale by providing a sense of "base," "middle," and "top", the following guidelines must be met:
(a)
Top: The "top" of the building shall emphasize a distinct profile or outline with elements such as projecting parapets, cornices, upper level setbacks, or pitched rooflines.
(b)
Middle: The middle of the building must be made distinct by change in building materials and/or color, windows, balconies, recessed panels, step backs, or other decorative features. The middle of a building typically consists of a pattern of upper-story windows.
(c)
Base: Buildings shall have a distinct "base" at the ground level by using articulation and materials such as stone, masonry, or decorative concrete. Distinction of the base may also be defined by windows, alcoves, water tables, a change in materials, texture or color, building overhangs, canopies, awnings, or other architectural elements. For multi-story buildings, a base may be one story tall, defined by a storefront, a cornice, or a change in materials.
The facades of all buildings shall be proportionally divided using architectural elements including windows and entries in conjunction with porches, arcades, and awnings. Any wall surface over 30 feet in length should include at least one change in plane. Larger buildings shall be divided into bays of 25 to 40 foot widths. Bays can be articulated by pilasters, piers, differentiation in material, texture, or color, or by variation in the wall plane.
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, adopted February 21, 2008, repealed the former Â§Â§ 726â€”730 and enacted new provisions in lieu thereof. Formerly, Â§Â§ 726â€”730 pertained to exterior building materials and architectural elements, exterior color selection, primary color(s), accent colors, and awnings, respectively, and derived from Ord. No. 884, adopted May 18, 2006.
Sec. 727. - Exterior building materials and architectural elements.
All sides of a building may have an impact on adjoining developments and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick, wood and stone), unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used. As a general rule, front facades should be at least 80 percent brick and/or stone. Side facades should be at least 50 percent brick and/or stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum requirement for primary materials and can consist entirely of secondary materials (e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only.
The following types of building materials should not be used on any part of the exterior of a building exposed to public view:
(a)
Metal building without a masonry base course or other architectural features;
(b)
Prefabricated steel panels;
(c)
Highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials;
(d)
Mill-finish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or doorframes;
(e)
Aluminum, vinyl or fiberglass siding or roofing materials;
(f)
Unfaced or painted concrete block;
(g)
Pre-cast concrete panels or exposed, unfinished foundation walls;
(h)
Exposed plywood or particle board;
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” See note at section 726.
Sec. 728. - Exterior color selection.
Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material and/or color selections will be avoided.
Facade colors should be low reflectance, and subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors should not be used.
Building colors should be carefully chosen so that each building color complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the "base" color (used on the majority of the building surface), "trim" color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and "accent" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” See note at section 726.
Sec. 729. - Primary color(s).
A maximum of three predominant colors should be designated as a primary unifying element. Accent colors should not be considered predominant colors. Flexibility may be used to allow additional colors and/or a range of predominant colors provided that these colors are in the same family of colors or are similar to each other. Any color specified as a primary unifying element shall be dominant in the building facade.
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” See note at section 726.
Sec. 730. - Accent colors.
Accent colors may be used as a secondary unifying element provided they are used throughout the development.
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” See note at section 726.
Sec. 730.1. - Awnings.
The use of awnings on buildings is encouraged to provide protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior. It is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame, covered by a canvas material. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs.
Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors complement the character of the structure or group of buildings.
Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face. Awnings on second floor windows can be used to soften the appearance of a particular elevation or to assist in reducing the scale of the overall building.
(Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, 2-21-2008)
Editor's noteâ€” Ord. No. 937, Â§ 1, adopted February 21, 2008, enacted provisions intended for use as Â§ 731. Inasmuch as there are already provisions so designated, and the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as Â§ 730.1. See note at section 726.
DIVISION 5. - STANDARDS FOR LIGHTING DESIGN

Sec. 731. - Building and site lighting.
All exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material, and color selections. Architectural and shoebox style cutoff fixtures shall be used in all parking areas as opposed to cobra type light fixtures and directional floodlights. Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site, and the light source is shielded from direct offsite viewing. All outdoor light fixtures should be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate uplighting, spill light, and glare.
Exterior architectural, display and decorative lighting visible from the designated corridors shall be generated from a concealed light source with low-level fixtures. Any lighting fixture used to illuminate parking areas, access drives or loading areas shall be of such design, so as to minimize the amount of ambient lighting perceptible from adjacent properties. In no case shall any lighting impair the vision of motorists on the corridor.
Entrances into developments from the designated corridors may be lighted for traffic safety reasons, provided such lighting does not exceed the applicable footcandle requirements specified below. Excessive illumination of signage, buildings, or site features should be avoided. Roof lighting and down-lighting washing the building walls are strongly discouraged.
731.1. Mounting height.
Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. The overall height of all lighting within parking lots should not exceed 30 feet in height from finish grade to the top of the light fixture. Lower mounting heights are encouraged where sites are located adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses. Use of low, bollard-type fixtures that are three to four feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting.
731.2. Light fixtures.
All light fixtures should be a cutoff luminaire whose source is completely concealed with opaque housing and should not be visible from any street. This provision includes lights on mounted poles, as well as architectural display and decorative lighting visible from the corridor. Fixtures should be mounted in such a manner that the cone of light is not directed at any property line of the site. Only incandescent, fluorescent, metal halide, mercury vapor or color corrected high-pressure sodium light may be used. The same type of lighting must be utilized for all fixtures and light sources on the site.
731.3. Illumination levels.
All site lighting should be designed so that the level of illumination measured in footcandles (fc) at any one point meets the standards below. The planning commission shall have the discretion to allow limited flexibility as to variations in the minimum and average levels, if the proposed levels are below the following standards. The planning commission shall not allow flexibility for proposed levels which exceed the maximum levels, unless such levels strictly conform to the recommended levels within the IESNA Lighting Handbook.
EXPAND
At property lines including right-of-way Minimum level Average level Maximum level
At property line abutting a residential use None - 0.5 fc
At property line abutting a retail use None - 1.0 fc
At property line abutting an office use None - 1.5 fc
Off-street parking lots Minimum level Average level Maximum level
Parking lots 0.5 fc 3.0 fc 6.0 fc
Walkways and streets 0.2 fc 1.0 fc 2.0 fc
Landscape and decorative 0.2 fc .50 fc 3.0 fc
Pedestrian 0.2 fc 2.0 fc 5.0 fc
  Lighting underneath canopies for service stations or similar uses shall be restricted to no more than two 320-watt recessed lighting fixtures (including lenses) mounted flush with the bottom of the canopy on each side of a gasoline pump or other design that meets the standards of this chapter. Lighting for canopies for service stations and other similar uses shall not exceed an average of 12 fc as measured at the ground level at the inside of the outside edge of the canopy. Lighting for ATM machines shall be recessed and mounted flush with the actual canopy above the ATM machine and shall comply with the latest requirements identified within the IESNA Lighting Handbook or established by federal regulations.
Decorative wall packs may be used only at service entrances to buildings and shall not be used to draw attention to the building or provide general building or site lighting. Wall packs on the exterior of a building shall be shielded (full cut-off type bulb or light source not visible from off-site) to direct light downward and be of low wattage (100 watts or lower).
Illumination of all monument signage shall be by an externally located steady light source, which is shielded and directed solely at the sign. The intensity of the light shall not exceed 20 fc at any one point on the sign face. Colored lamps are not permitted.

Sec. 732. - Electrical streetlighting.
(a)
Electrical streetlighting shall be installed in all subdivisions.
(b)
Adequate streetlighting shall be determined and approved by the city planner during the approval of a preliminary plat. One copy of the approved streetlighting plan shall be forwarded to the electrical utility company servicing the subdivision.
(c)
The developer shall provide adequate lighting at street intersections, and dead-end streets including culs-de-sac, and all at-grade cart paths crossing with collectors or arterial.
(d)
As a minimum, luminaires are to be mounted at least 16 feet above grade. As a maximum, luminaires are to be mounted not more than 28 feet above grade. Adjustment in spacing and luminaire height may be made due to street curves, topography and natural foliage and type of equipment. A design within the range of the minimum and maximum shall be considered for approval that produces the effective horizontal illumination of 0.2 footcandle.
(e)
Poles, fixtures and all related materials must be available standard stock items through the electric utility company servicing the subdivision or must be approved by the city planner.
(f)
The developer shall pay the cost of installing the streetlights to the city planner and forwarding it on to city clerk during or before final plat approval. The city clerk shall forward the payment to the utility.
(g)
The city will accept monthly charges for street light units on public property after negotiation and contract with the utility company following satisfactory implementation of subsections (a) through (f) above.

DIVISION 6. - SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 733. - Submittal requirements.
As a part of the conceptual site plan submittal, the applicant shall be required to provide the following information to the city planner for review and distribution to the planning commission for consideration:
(a)
Schematic architectural elevations for all buildings or a set of design guidelines that include the unifying elements that are to be incorporated within the overall project (including each outparcel);
(b)
Identification of primary physical characteristics of each building including predominant color(s), exterior materials and architectural features;
(c)
Primary landscape theme (general, not specific);
(d)
Proposed building heights;
(e)
Proposed lighting plan (general);
(f)
Other elements which may be relevant to a specific development and how they are compatible with the adjacent sites; and
(g)
Signage program (general).
Color samples shall be submitted to the planning commission as a part of the conceptual site plan review process and shall be kept on file once approved. Colored renderings may be required, but shall not be a substitute for this requirement. In addition to listing the color(s), the design guidelines shall also describe how and where the color will be used. It is recognized that the same color on a different material may not match exactly.
A lighting plan shall be required for all non-single family residential developments of one acre or more in size. When required, lighting plans shall illustrate all proposed lighting on a site and buildings. The plan should illustrate areas of night illumination and the amount of light at various places measured in footcandles (fc). When required, the lighting plans hall consist of either isofootcandles (connecting points of equal light illumination levels, similar to a topographic contour) or a photometric grid with individual spot readings). No lighting plan shall be approved which will result in direct light that exceeds the requirements or is other wise inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006)
Sec. 734. - Requirements following project completion.
The present owner and all subsequent owners of the property shall maintain all appearance features, lighting and landscaping approved by the planning commission.
Changes beyond the owner's control shall be restored by the owner, unless otherwise provided.
Any modifications to any element of the site plan, building design or lighting initially approved by the planning commission will require subsequent review and approval by the planning commission.
