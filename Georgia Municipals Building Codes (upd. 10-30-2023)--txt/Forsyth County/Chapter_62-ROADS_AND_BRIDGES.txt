Sec. 62-34. - Administration.
The administrator shall administer and enforce the provisions of this article for the application for and issuance of permits under this article.
(Ord. No. 34, § 4, 1-27-1987)
Sec. 62-35. - Duties of administrator.
The administrator, or an authorized representative, shall have, among others, the following duties:
(1)
To prepare and provide the necessary forms for the application for a permit and for the submission of any required information as may be necessary to properly administer and enforce the provisions of this article.
(2)
To review the application for completeness, collect whatever fee and escrow deposit may be required; to designate sites and set time schedules where more than one activity shall occur on the same day; to coordinate with City of Cumming authorities on all matters concerning such activities; and, where appropriate to receive the approval of the department of transportation, state highway patrol, and the sheriff, or any other necessary public officer, for the requested activity.
(3)
To issue to the private organization or group of private persons a permit within a reasonable time of such approval. The administrator may, however, where he deems it appropriate, defer the issuance of a permit until the application for the permit shall have been approved by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. 34, § 5, 1-27-1987)
Sec. 62-36. - Procedure for issuance.
(a)
If any provision of this article provides for the review of an application for a permit by a county officer designated therein, the administrator shall forward a copy of the application to that officer. The officer charged with the duty of reviewing the application shall make a recommendation thereon, favorable or otherwise, and shall return the recommendation to the administrator after receiving a copy of the application.
(b)
Upon the receipt of the recommendation of the reviewing officer as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or upon the receipt of the application if no reviewing officer is designated, the administrator shall take action upon the recommendation and application; although, in a proper case, he may refer the application to the board of commissioners for consideration and action at its next public meeting.
(c)
Unless some significant interference with the rights of nonparticipating citizens exists, the orderly flow of traffic would be obstructed unreasonably, the public safety would be endangered, or there would be other unreasonable interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order, and convenience of the general public, the permit shall be granted. Where more than one permit is sought for the same date, the administrator shall have authority to designate reasonable sites and set time schedules for the beginning and ending of the activity. The administrator shall have authority to cancel the permit where the activity fails to begin within a reasonable time after the time set for it to begin, based on other activities for which permits have been granted or based on the unreasonable interference caused by such delay with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order and convenience to the general public. As a condition to issuing a permit, the administrator may require the private organization or group of private persons to provide personnel for trash cleanup of affected areas littered during the activity for which a permit is sought, the provision of first aid and medical resources if considered necessary by the administrator, proof of sufficient storage areas for a large influx of motor vehicles occasioned by the permitted activity, provision of temporary toilet facilities and other similar special and extraordinary items considered to be necessary for the permitted activity in the opinion of the administrator, based on his past experience with such activities and his coordination with other county, city and state officials. In no event shall the administrator require private organizations or groups of private persons to provide personnel for normal governmental functions, such as traffic control and police protection. If additional requirements are placed on private organizations or groups of private persons in accordance with this subsection, and those requirements are not met despite assurances by such private organization or group of private persons, then such failure to comply with such requirements shall be grounds for denial of any subsequent permit requested by the private organization or group of private persons and for any other claims for funds expended by the county for those extraordinary expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant.
(d)
The administrator shall issue a permit to the applicant therefor, which permit shall state the nature of the activity authorized and bear the date of issuance and the signature of the administrator.
(e)
Any applicant whose application for a permit under this article is denied by the administrator may appeal such denial to the board of commissioners, which shall consider such appeal at the regularly scheduled meeting next following the receipt of the applicant's appeal, if the applicant has submitted such appeal by the day items are to be placed on the agenda in accordance with normal procedures of the board of commissioners. If an applicant fails to appeal before the agenda is prepared, he may nevertheless be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners if he has provided each of the commissioners a copy of the application which he submitted to the administrator and the reasons given by the administrator for the denial not less than 24 hours prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners shall consider the appeal by requiring the administrator to explain why the permit was denied. Unless the administrator can show significant interference with the rights of nonparticipating citizens; an unreasonable obstruction of the orderly flow of traffic; a clear and present endangerment to citizens of the county; other specific unreasonable interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order, and convenience of the general public, or failure to comply with the dictates of this article, the permit shall be granted.
(f)
In no event shall any private organization or group of private persons be permitted to bring signs, banners, posters, leaflets, handbills or any other printed material of any size or shape containing any message intended to influence any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty at the county courthouse and the grounds upon which it stands. No private organization or group of private persons may use the county courthouse grounds for private purposes in holding a parade, assembly, demonstration, or other activity on any nonholiday weekday, prior to 5:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. on any Saturday or public holiday, or prior to 1:00 p.m. or after 5:00 p.m. on any Sunday.
