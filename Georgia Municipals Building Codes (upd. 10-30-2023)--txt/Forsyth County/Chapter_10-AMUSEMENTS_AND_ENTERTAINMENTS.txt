Sec. 10-31. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
It is the intent and purpose of this article to regulate the place of operation of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein. This article is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. The Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County finds that restricting adult entertainment establishments to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate such establishments by delineating zones where adult entertainment establishments are most compatible with other uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The board also finds that requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult entertainment establishment uses and other uses will afford the most protection to residential uses. It is not the intent or purpose of the board of commissioners, in enacting this article, to deny any person's right to speech, conduct or expression protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions. In the enactment of this article, the board intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
(b)
The board of commissioners finds, based on a 1984 study entitled Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis, that areas with sexually oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar areas with no sexually oriented business. Specifically, the board finds that the study reveals that sex-related crimes, defined in the study as rape, indecent exposure, obscene conduct, child molestation, adult molestation, and commercial sex, are much more prevalent in areas where adult entertainment is offered than in areas where no adult entertainment is offered. The same finding is true as to the occurrences of major crimes.
(c)
The board of commissioners further finds, based on a May 19, 1986 study from Austin, Texas, entitled Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin, that a severe decline in residential property values may be precipitated by the presence of an adult entertainment establishment, particularly where that adult entertainment establishment is located within one block of residential property uses. Furthermore, the board finds that there is an indication that the introduction of adult entertainment establishments into areas of family-oriented, owner-occupied residential neighborhoods may precipitate a transition to a more transient, renter-occupied neighborhood, which leads to depressed property values and urban blight.
(d)
The board of commissioners further finds, based on an October 1980 study of the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, entitled An Analysis of the Relationship Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime and Housing Values, that adult businesses do have a significant and consistent positive correlation with the crime rate index and a negative correlation with the mean single-family housing value. The board of commissioners also finds, based on this study, that adult entertainment businesses should be permitted only in locations that are at least 1,500 feet, from residential areas and that adult entertainment businesses should not be placed adjacent to one another.
(e)
The board of commissioners further finds, based on a June 1978 study from St. Paul, Minnesota, entitled Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul, that the presence of adult entertainment establishments correlates statistically with poor neighborhood conditions. The board of commissioners finds based on this study that the location of adult entertainment establishments correlates significantly with neighborhood blight and deterioration.
(f)
Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values.

The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone or make legal any activity thereunder if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the state or the United States. No annual license for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued by the county if the premises to be used also holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises.

The annual regulatory fee must be paid to the county manager or his or her designated representative no later than November 30 of the year preceding the year for which the renewal is to be effective. In any event, no adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire on December 31 of each year. Licensees who desire to renew their license shall file an application with the county manager on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any renewal application received after November 30 shall pay, in addition to said annual regulatory fee, a late charge of 20 percent. If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as hereinafter set forth in this article will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year.
