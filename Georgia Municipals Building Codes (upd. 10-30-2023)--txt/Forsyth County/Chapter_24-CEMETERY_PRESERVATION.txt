Sec. 24-2. - Findings and intent.
Considering the fact that this county has been richly blessed with the heritage and history of its people who are now deceased; that many of those who have passed on have been memorialized with resting places in cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds that have been abandoned, desecrated, neglected, unmarked, and are threatened by unknowing development; and that such abandoned, desecrated, neglected, and unmarked cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds are not a befitting tribute to such honorable citizens of the past; therefore, it is the desire of the board of commissioners to provide for the preservation, protection, and maintenance of all such family and community cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds.
(Ord. No. 113, § 1, 6-1-2009)
Sec. 24-3. - Exemption for identification of burial grounds.
Archaeologists, the county coroner, and the planning and community development director are exempt from the requirements of this article for the purposes of identification of burial grounds by probing, magnatrometer, or such other processes recognized by the archaeological community.
(Ord. No. 113, § 1, 6-1-2009; Amd. of 12-1-2011)
Sec. 24-4. - Notification of disturbed burial ground.
(a)
Any person who knows or has reason to know that a human burial is being disturbed, destroyed, defaced, mutilated, removed, excavated, or exposed shall immediately notify the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction in the area where the burial ground is located.
(b)
Any law enforcement agency, county department, or other source which finds evidence or receives a report that a burial ground has been located or disturbed shall notify the county coroner, the planning and community development director, and the board of commissioners.
(c)
When human remains are discovered, all land disturbing activities that may affect the burial ground shall immediately cease, and the discovering party shall notify the local law enforcement agency and the county coroner of the discovery. Within 48 hours, the county coroner, the planning and community development director, and local law enforcement shall determine whether or not the grave is part of a cemetery. If it is determined that the grave is a cemetery, then the planning and community development director shall undertake efforts to identify and preserve the burial ground. If it is determined that it is not a cemetery site, then the local law enforcement agency, in conjunction with the county coroner, shall be responsible for proper disposition of the remains. Once the planning and community development director has established the approximate boundaries of the burial ground, there shall be established a protective buffer not greater than 50 feet, as determined by the planning and community development director. An appeal of this determination may be had to the board of zoning appeals. No land disturbing activity shall resume without the express written authorization from the planning and community development director or his designee.
