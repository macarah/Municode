Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
Undisturbed State Waters Buffers shall be applied in accordance with the Unified Development Code Chapter 18.11.2.
(c)
Land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. Maximum cut slopes shall be 2 horizontal to 1 vertical. Continuous fill slopes ten feet in height or less may be 2 horizontal to 1 vertical. All continuous fill slopes that exceed 10 feet in height must be 3 horizontal to 1 vertical unless:
a.
A mechanically engineered stabilized slope is approved by the director of engineering; or
b.
The designed and constructed slopes are certified by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia with experience with geotechnical engineering;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential and minimize land disturbance;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented;
(5)
Disturbed areas shall be covered with either temporary or permanent stabilization as soon as practicable upon achieving final grade or in any area on which land disturbing activities have occurred that is to remain undisturbed for more than seven days. In any event, the disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any such case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Sediment barriers must be removed from projects where land disturbing activities have occurred; but only when the project has undergone final stabilization in accordance with the state general permit;
(15)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for control or treatment of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in section 34-34(b)(2);
(16)
Except as provided in paragraphs (17) and (18) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(17)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(18)
There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
(19)
Clearing and grading required for construction of streets, drainage, and utilities is not considered mass grading; therefore mass grading shall not be allowed in RES1 and RES2 zoning districts; however, mass grading may be allowed for commercial and institutional uses permitted in the RES1 and RES2 zoning districts. Mass grading may be allowed in the RES3 zoning district if the department of engineering determines that the topography and configuration of the property reasonably require mass grading. Mass grading is allowed in R-4 and R-6 zoning districts provided that all mass grading activities shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(20)
For residential developments on property totaling 25 acres or more, no land disturbance permit shall be issued that would allow the disturbance of more than 20 acres in any single contiguous area and no more than two non-contiguous areas may be disturbed at any one time. Whenever two non-contiguous areas in a residential development are disturbed at the same time, no new disturbance may be undertaken in the development until at least one of the two non-contiguous disturbed areas is stabilized, as determined by the department of engineering, prior to any additional land disturbance being undertaken.
Variance allowance. The 20-acre disturbance limitation may be varied to a maximum of 25 acres upon demonstration of a hardship. For purposes of such a variance, a hardship shall not mean (1) that it would be less costly to complete land disturbance if the restrictions were varied or (2) that the applicant has a personal circumstance warranting relief that is unrelated to a unique condition of the property.
To justify a hardship warranting a variance to the land disturbance limitations in this section, the applicant bears the burden of showing:
• Unusual topography, soil types, streams, or other physical characteristics of the property.
• That were unknown or not subject to reasonable discovery when the property was acquired;
• That are not of a type that is condition commonly shared among developments of a similar nature;
• That are not self-imposed; and
• That if the literal requirements of the code are followed, it will result in either (a) a substantial burden on the applicant that is meaningfully different than that faced by others when complying with the same requirements; (b) environmental damage or degradation that is inconsistent with the objectives of the county, or (c) a significant adverse impact on adjacent properties.
Variance application. In the event an applicant believes a hardship exists, an application for variance may be tendered to the Forsyth County Board of Zoning Appeals as contemplated in the Forsyth County Unified Development Code, Section 8-6.3.
Variance submission. The application submissions shall be as set forth in UDC, Section 8-6.3, as are appropriate, but shall also include any additional documentation deemed necessary by the Forsyth County Department of Engineering. The variance application shall include a phased grading plan for the entire development and a narrative that enumerates all reasons for the asserting that a hardship justifies exceeding the 20-acre maximum disturbed acreage limit.
Variance consideration. UDC sections 8-6.4(B), (C), (D), and (E) shall be observed, except that the variance criteria to be considered by the Board shall be limited to the four previously identified criteria rather than the criteria set forth in UDC 8-6.4(C)(4)(a)(i)—(vi);
Appeals. The applicant shall have all other appellate rights afforded by the UDC.
(21)
In order to establish a sedimentation baseline with respect to any downstream lake or pond that will receive storm water discharge from a directly adjacent development, the developer shall utilize good faith efforts to seek permission from the property owner upon which the downstream lake or pond sits, to perform a sedimentation study of said lake or pond. The sedimentation study shall be provided in a form and utilizing the parameters as are established by the Forsyth County Engineering Department. If the adjacent property owner will not agree to allow such study to be performed, then the requirement to perform a pre-development sedimentation study shall be deemed waived. The developer shall memorialize the lack of consent by the adjacent property owner, and such documentation shall become part of the Forsyth County development file. If the adjacent property consents to a pre-development sedimentation study being performed, then the developer shall undertake same at its sole cost and the results of such study shall be provided to Forsyth County prior to the issuance of any land disturbance permits. The pre-development sedimentation study shall also be provided to the owner of the adjacent property upon which the lake or pond sits. In the event of future complaints regarding sedimentation accumulation in the downstream lake or pond caused by the development, the pre-development sedimentation study may be used by Forsyth County and the adjacent property owner, as the case may be, to determine if, and the extent of, any development-related sedimentation. This shall provide both the adjacent property owner and/or Forsyth County an opportunity to determine what responsive action, if any, is warranted. If remediation of the downstream lake or pond is warranted, in no event shall the developer have an obligation to remediate the lake to a condition such that it contains less sediment than identified in the baseline pre-development sedimentation study. Notwithstanding any term or provision in this paragraph, Forsyth County shall have no mandatory obligation to remediate or participate in the remediation of the lake or to pursue remedial action against the developer.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
In addition to the stream buffer requirements in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article, the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners has adopted a 50-foot undisturbed buffer with an additional 25-foot impervious setback as outlined in Chapter 18.11.2 of the Unified Development Code.
(f)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
( Ord. No. 73-E , § IV, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 34-35. - Application/permit process.

All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10), shalt be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(6)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, acceptable to the issuing authority prior to the issuance of the permit. The amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit, or combination thereof, shall be $3,000.00 per disturbed acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, except that in the event the director of engineering determines that special circumstances exist such as would warrant a need for additional protection, the director of engineering shall have the discretion to increase the bond amount up to a total of $5,000.00 per disturbed acre or fraction thereof. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(c)
Plan requirements:
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article.

(6)
No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the Forsyth County Tax Commissioner certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid. In the event a permit is required to maintain erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control measures, the director of engineering may allow for a permit to be issued.
(7)
The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
( Ord. No. 73-E , § V, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 34-36. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
The local issuing authority may periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he and the property shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinance to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The local issuing authority shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(e)
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

Sec. 34-182. - Findings.
(a)
Uncontrolled stormwater runoff may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of Forsyth County and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters. The potential impacts of these pollutant and nutrient loadings include:
(1)
Sediment can alter natural systems, scouring vital habitat and smothering stream life.
(2)
Increased bacteria can pose a significant health risk.
(3)
Excessive nutrients can accelerate algae growth and eutrophication of receiving waters, affecting adversely flora and fauna.
(4)
Pollutants and nutrients can negatively affect vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities.
(5)
Metals can be toxic to aquatic life.
(6)
Oil and grease can reduce oxygen levels.
(7)
The temperature of receiving waters can increase, affecting animal and plant habitat adversely.
(b)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(c)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff. These changes may result in the following:
(1)
Stream banks can erode and slump, resulting in widening of streams;
(2)
Tree root systems can be undercut;
(3)
Erosion rates can increase; or,
(4)
Streambeds can become more uniform and shallower, providing less varied aquatic habitats.
(d)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described in subsections (a) through (c) of this section could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increases in water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(e)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(f)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the County storm sewer system.
(g)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm sewer system.

ARTICLE VI. - REGULATED FLOODPLAIN[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Cross reference— Floods, ch. 46.

Sec. 34-221. - Findings.
It is necessary to exercise the police powers delegated to the board of commissioners by 1979 Ga. Laws, page 4001, to designate a floodplain, to regulate construction therein; to provide for floodplain and watershed integrity, to provide for violations and punishment thereof, to enact provisions for those purposes, and for other purposes.
(Ord. No. 7, 8-5-1980)
Sec. 34-222. - Floodplain established.
(a)
The regulated floodplain of Big Creek, South Forsyth County, is hereby established to extend from the intersection of Big Creek with McGinnis Ferry Road on the south, northward along both sides of Big Creek to the intersection of Big Creek with Shiloh Road on the north. The boundaries of the regulated floodplain on either side of Big Creek are hereby established with reference to distance above mean sea level. At the following specific locations, land lying at or below the indicated contour elevations shall be part of the regulated floodplain of Big Creek, South Forsyth County. Excluded therefrom is land lying within the right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400:
(1)
Intersection of Big Creek with the north right-of-way of McGinnis Ferry Road, 998 feet above mean sea level;
(2)
Intersection of Big Creek with the north right-of-way of McFarland Road, 1,007.5 feet above mean sea level;
(3)
Intersection of Big Creek with the southeast right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400, 1,008 feet above mean sea level;
(4)
Intersection of Big Creek with the northwest right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400, 1,009 feet above mean sea level; and
(5)
Intersection of Big Creek with the south right-of-way of Shiloh Road, 1,011 feet above mean sea level.
(b)
Between the established elevation points listed in subsection (a) of this section, the floodplain maximum elevations shall increase or decrease in the same proportion as the streambed elevation of Big Creek increases or decreases at a given time of measurement. Calculations shall be made according to the shortest straight line distance to Big Creek. For example, all points at or below 1,007.5 feet contour elevation perpendicular to the centerline of Big Creek at the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section are within the regulated floodplain; likewise all points at or below 1,008 feet contour elevation perpendicular to the centerline of Big Creek at the point established in subsection (a)(3) of this section are within the regulated floodplain; therefore, the actual streambed elevation increase of Big Creek between those points shall determine the floodplain elevation at intermediate points; should the Big Creek streambed elevation at the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section be four feet less than the point established in subsection (a)(3) of this section at the same time of measurement, then any point closest to where the streambed level of Big Creek is two feet above the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be within the regulated floodplain if such point is at or below 1,007.75 feet above mean sea level. The formula for determining whether a given point is within the regulated floodplain is given in Exhibit C in section 34-229.
