The department shall inform the owner by letter of any failure to comply by the time of the first reinspection. The department will allow an additional 15 days for the correction. If the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second reinspection, the department will inform the owner by letter that the water service to the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five days. If the owner informs the department of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the department but in no case will exceed an additional 30 days.
(5)
If the department determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
(6)
The department shall have on file a list of private contractors who are certified backflow device testers. All chargers for these tests will be paid by the owner of the building or property.
(7)
The department will begin initial premises inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the approval of this program by the commission, during the calendar year 1999. Initial focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
(b)
Owner's responsibility.
(1)
The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross connection on his premises.
(2)
The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the department, shall at his expense install, maintain, and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
(3)
The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing.
(4)
The owner shall inform the department of any proposed or modified cross connections and also any existing cross connections of which the owner is aware but which have not been found by the department.
(5)
The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
(6)
The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the department.
(7)
The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the department.
(8)
Any owner having a private well or other private water source must have a permit if the well or source cross connected to the department's system. Permission to cross connect may be denied by the department. The owner shall be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross connected to the department's system.
(9)
If the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the department's side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
(10)
The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for noncompliance with department requirements.
(Ord. No. 83, § VI, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 18-137. - Degree of hazard.
The department recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double check valves.
(Ord. No. 83, § VII, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 18-138. - Permits.
The department shall not permit a cross connection within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated.
(1)
Cross connection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from the department. A fee of $50.00 will be charged for the initial permit and $25.00 for the renewal of each permit.
(2)
Permits shall be renewed once every year and are nontransferable. Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of cross connection or degree of hazard associated with the service.
(3)
A permit is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with the utilization of a nontestable backflow preventer.
(Ord. No. 83, § VIII, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 18-139. - Existing in-use backflow prevention devices.
Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supercede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed if no backflow device is present.
(Ord. No. 83, § IX, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 18-140. - Periodic testing.
(a)
Reduced pressure principle backflow devices shall be tested and inspected at least semi-annually.
(b)
Periodic testing shall be performed by the department's certified tester or his delegated representative. This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
(c)
The testing shall be conducted during the department's regular business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the department.
(d)
Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to ensure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring the uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
(e)
Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in subsection (a) of this section in cases where there is a history of test failures and the department feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional test will be borne by the owner.

(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to vacate and close or demolish and remove such dwelling, building, structure, or property and all debris from the property.
For the purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property" without consideration of the value of the land on which a structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure or property to bring it into compliance may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with the Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure or property shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure or property into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in Forsyth County.
(i)
Noncompliance with the order. If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, vacate and close, or demolish and remove the dwelling, building, structure, or property, the public officer or his designee may cause such dwelling, building, structure, or property to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer, or his designee, shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, structure, or property a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(j)
Demolition procedure. If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and Forsyth County Board of Commissioners are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(k)
Recovery of costs of abatement. The amount of the cost of repair, closure or demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
Said lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien in the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
After filing a certified copy of the order with the Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court and final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer shall transmit to the county tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure.
It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of county taxes, to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the Board of Commissioners for Forsyth County.
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this section. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this section.
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority and county tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
If legally possible and the property is still in existence, the board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, structure, or property on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(l)
Appeal; injunction. Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, closure or demolition of a dwelling, building, structure, or property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under Code section 5-3-29.
Any person affected by an order issued by the public officer may petition to the Forsyth County Superior Court for an injunction restraining the Public Officer from carrying out the provisions of the order, and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such person shall present such petition to the court within 15 days of the posting and service of the order of the public officer. De novo hearings shall be held by the court on petitions within 20 days. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require; provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this section.
