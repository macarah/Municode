Section 2. - Membership; composition.
(a)
The board of commissioners of Forsyth County shall consist of five members. For the purpose [of] electing such members, Forsyth County shall be divided into five commissioner districts. The districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as "Plan Name: forsythccsb-2011 Plan Type: Local User: bak".
(b)
(1)
For the purposes of such plan:
(A)
The term "VTD" shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a district description which are underneath a "VTD" heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a VTD as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia; and
(B)
Except as otherwise provided in the description of any district, whenever the description of any district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia.
(2)
Any part of Forsyth County which is not included in any district described in subsection (b) of this section shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia.
(3)
Any part of Forsyth County which is described in subsection (b) of this section as being included in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia.
(c)
There shall be one member of the board from each commissioner district. A commissioner must reside in the commissioner district such person represents. A candidate shall designate the district from which such candidate offers for election. Beginning with the general election in 2010 and continuing in subsequent elections, members of the board shall be elected by the electors of their respective districts and not by the voters of the entire county. The election of members of the board shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code."
(d)
The members of the board who were elected at the general election in November 2008 shall continue in office for the terms to which they were elected and until successors are elected and qualified as provided in this Act. The members of the board who were elected at the general election in November 2010 shall continue in office for the terms to which they were elected and until successors are elected and qualified as provided in this Act.
(e)
The first members of the reconstituted board of commissioners of Forsyth County from Commissioner Districts 2, 4 and 5 shall be elected at the general election in November 2012. Such members shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified.
(f)
The first members of the reconstituted board of commissioners of Forsyth County from Commissioner Districts 2, 4, and 5 shall be elected at the general election in November 2004. Such members shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified.
(g)
Successors to members elected under subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall be elected at the November general election next preceding the expiration of such terms of office and shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified.
(h)
Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they existed on January 1, 2011, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and, on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this section.
