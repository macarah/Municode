(13)
Each applicant shall certify that applicant has read and understands this chapter and if the license is granted, each licensee shall maintain a copy of this chapter on the premises and shall require each of the licensee's employees to be familiar with this chapter.

In the event the failure to obtain fingerprinting information from state and federal authorities delays completion of the written report, the sheriff's office may later supplement any fingerprinting information. If the fingerprinting information later reveals that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, this may be grounds for denying the application or revoking a license, despite an otherwise satisfactory written report.

(a)
Every licensee or his agent is hereby authorized and directed to collect the tax imposed herein from purchasers of alcoholic beverages by the drink within the licensed premises. Such licensee or agent shall furnish such information as may be required by the department head to facilitate the collection of the tax.
(b)
If requested by the purchaser, every licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink shall at the time of collection for food and drinks served give to the purchaser a receipt on which the purchase price and tax imposed by this article on alcoholic beverages by the drink shall be itemized separately. In all cases where the collection of food and drinks is by deferred payment or credit, the licensee is liable at the time of, and to the extent that such credits are incurred in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof. The department head and the board of commissioners shall have the authority to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax.
(c)
The taxes imposed by this section shall become due and payable from the purchaser at the time of purchase of any alcoholic beverage by the drink in this county. The full amount of such taxes collected by the licensee shall be due and payable to the county monthly, on or before the 20 th day of the month following each monthly period a return for the preceding monthly period shall be filed with the finance department in such form as the department head may prescribe by every licensee liable for the payment of tax hereunder; all returns shall show the gross receipt from the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink and the amount of the tax collected on such drinks.
(d)
If the department head has cause to believe that the return, or the amount of tax required to be paid to the county by any licensee is not proper, he may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information that is available to him. Should the county determine that a deficiency exists in the amount of the tax due by the licensee for one or more monthly periods, the amount of the deficiency shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof from the due date of taxes. The department head or his designated representative shall give to the licensee written notice of this deficiency determination, and notice may be served by the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office or by mail; if by mail such service shall be addressed to the registered agent of the licensee.

(e)
If any licensee fails to make a return, the department head shall make an estimate of the amounts of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, the amount of the total sales within the county which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is available to the department head. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed in the preceding paragraph. The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 20 th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof would have been returned until the date of payment.
(f)
Any licensee who fails to pay the tax herein imposed, or fails to pay any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the county within the time required, shall pay a penalty or 20 percent of the tax or amount of the tax in addition to the tax or amount of the tax plus interest on the unpaid tax or any portion thereof as set forth in the preceding section.
(g)
At any time within three years after any tax, or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable, and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax, or any amount of tax required to be collected, the county may bring an action in the courts of this state, of any other state, or of the United States to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees, and other legal fees incident thereto. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under this chapter, it may be offset against any future liability for the tax. If the licensee determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the department head, he will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing, stating the specific ground upon which his claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the department head, the excess amount paid to the county may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the licensee or may be refunded to the licensee if the licensee is no longer operation a licensed premises in the county.

The department head or any person authorized in writing by the board of commissioners may examine the books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any licensee liable for the tax in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return is made by the licensee, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the administration of the provision of this section, the department head may require the filing of the reports by any person or class of persons having in such person's or possession or custody information relating to the purchases which are subject to the tax. The report shall be filed with the department head and shall set forth the purchase price for each purchase, the date or dates of purchase and such other information as the department head may require. The licensee shall keep a copy of this chapter at the outlet at all times. All employees of the licensee will be informed of the contents of this section.
(i)
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this section is committed, continued, or permitted by such person and shall be punished accordingly. Any licensee or any other person who fails to furnish any return required to be made, or fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the department head, or who renders a false or fraudulent return shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as aforesaid.

Sec. 6-143. - Nude dancing; findings; public purpose.
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Forsyth County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so- called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section 6-143 is hereby adopted.
(a)
Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcohol beverages for consumption on such premises within the unincorporated area of Forsyth County:

(2)
