ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF ETHICS FOR CITY OFFICIALS

Sec. 2-251. - Declaration of policy.
It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policies be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.

Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in manners that affect the city.

City official and official mean the mayor, commissioners, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city manager, assistant city managers, city clerk, deputy city clerks, whether such person is salaried, hired or elected, and all other persons holding positions designated by the city Charter, as amended. The term "city official," unless otherwise expressly defined, includes individuals appointed by the board of commissioners to all city commissions, committees, boards, task forces or other city bodies, unless specifically exempted from this article by the board of commissioners, and other salaried employees.
