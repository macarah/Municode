Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 19, 2018, repealed art. IX in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former art. IX, §§ 22-400—22-418, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance adopted March 4, 2014, § 1.

Sec. 22-400. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Jesup Pawnshop, Pawnbroker, Secondhand Dealer, Junk Dealer, Junk Collector, Coin Dealer, Gold Buyer, Silver Buyer and Used Precious Metals and Gems Dealer Ordinance."
(Ord. of 6-19-2018(2))
Sec. 22-401. - Findings and intent.
(a)
This article is adopted to address and promote the interests of public safety, health and welfare of the City of Jesup and its citizens, to aid and assist in the recovery of stolen property, to aid and assist local law enforcement in fulfilling its public safety functions, and to facilitate peaceful, lawful, orderly and efficient pawn brokering, the purchase, sale and consignment of secondhand goods, the purchase and sale of junk or swap items, and the purchase and sale from members of the public of coins, gold, silver, and other used precious metals and gems within the City of Jesup.
(b)
The city recognizes that pawnshops, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, junk collectors, coin dealers, gold buyers, silver buyers, and used precious metals and gems dealers are legitimate businesses authorized by or otherwise permitted under state law. However, the city finds that the services offered by such forms of business may provide an opportunity for individuals to potentially transfer stolen property to those businesses. The city also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving these businesses. The city further finds that the various purchase, sale, swap, consignment or pawn transactions of pawnshops, secondhand dealers and junk, coin, gold, silver and used precious metals and gems dealers have expanded beyond the city's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The purpose of the city's regulation of pawnshops, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, junk collectors, coin dealers, gold buyers, silver buyers, and used precious metals and gems dealers is to prevent such forms of business from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and also to ensure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens, pursuant to authority granted to the city by state law and the Constitution of the State of Georgia.

An affirmative duty is imposed upon every person operating or employed by a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer to monitor and report any activity of his, her, or its sellers which appears to unreasonable to the average, prudent person. Such signals of unreasonable conduct include, but are not limited to: offerings of items substantially below value or presentation of items well in excess of items encountered in the normal course of business of that particular pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer.
(g)
To incentivize persons operating or employed by a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals to report encounters with lost or stolen items, a 20 percent reduction in the annual permit or application fee of said person will be credited for aiding in the successful conviction of any individual offender.
(h)
If a lost or stolen item is seized or taken into custody from a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer by any law enforcement agency, particularly the municipal police, pursuant to an investigation, tip, complaint or police report, the original, lawful owner shall have the ability to reclaim such item through the normal procedures for reclaiming lost or stolen goods applicable to that law enforcement agency and/or through laws of general state-wide application.
(i)
The original, lawful owner of a lost or stolen item, which is found for sale by a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer, shall have the prerogative to reclaim such item at no more than the price at which the item was purchased by the said pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer. In order to establish that an individual was the original, lawful owner of a lost or stolen item, such individual may establish ownership through a showing of an original purchase receipt, invoice, certificate of title, verification, transfer form, warranty agreement, or other purchase document. The original, lawful owner must establish such ownership through a presentation to the municipal police who will determine whether such claim is valid by a preponderance of the evidence. Evidence which should be considered includes: witness testimonials, affidavits of witnesses, photographs, or any other compelling evidence.

(6)
In the event that a license has been suspended or revoked as a result of the offering for sale of a lost or stolen item or items and such legitimate owner of the item demands its return, a suspended or revoked license will only be reinstated upon the showing of either: (a) the return of such lost or stolen item or items to proper owner if such item is still available, or (b) a showing that restitution has been paid in full to the proper owner for the fair market value, as determined by a disinterested third party appraiser or evaluator, of the stolen item.
