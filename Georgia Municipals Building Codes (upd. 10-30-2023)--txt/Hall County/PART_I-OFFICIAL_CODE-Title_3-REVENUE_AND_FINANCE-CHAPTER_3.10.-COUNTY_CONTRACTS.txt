(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.070. - Ethics.
A.
It is the policy of Hall County to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the county finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the county. Hall County will establish and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best quality and value.
B.
Hall County declares that county employees and officials, along with those wishing to do business with the county, have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive, or unethical practices.
C.
Hall County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition.
D.
Prospective vendors must compete for county business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications, or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee, or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction.
E.
Bidders and proposers shall disclose on competitive bid responses any individual(s), firm(s), and/or county official(s) who do business with the county if there is an appearance of a conflict of interest.
F.
Ethical business practices are important, both, during a solicitation, and after the decision to grant an award. The county seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The purchasing manager, subject to the approval of the director of financial services, is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other instrument of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation.
G.
A vendor's contract compliance history with Hall County and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation.
H.
Hall County stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The purchasing manager, subject to the approval of the director of financial services, is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the county's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably and shall have a direct relationship to the county's goals.
I.
Hall County employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner.
J.
It is unethical for any county employee to purchase commodities or services from a county contract for personal use.
K.
With the exception of solicitations for the sale of real property, individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a Hall County contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other county representative other than the purchasing associate named in the solicitation, or the county's financial advisor, between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners. The purchasing manager will review violations. If determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award. Solicitations for the sale of real property may allow for verbal or written communications with the appropriate Hall County representative.
L.
All county commissioners, officials, and employees shall adhere to the standards outlined in the Hall County Code of Ethics.
M.
The purchasing division of the financial services department shall determine and implement methods of educating all prospective contractors, bidders, proposers, and vendors on the requirements and provisions of Code section 3.10.070, including, but not limited to, requiring each prospective contractor, bidder, proposer, and vendor that expresses an intent to do business with the county to sign an affidavit attesting that they have read this chapter and have more specifically also read Code section 3.10.070.

(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.090. - Budgeted expenditures.
It is the responsibility of the department/division directors to ensure all purchases are consistent with and support the current approved budget prior to committing funds. Specific approval is required for certain capital purchases, as provided in the budget resolution.
(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.100. - Procurement organization.
A.
The purchasing division of the financial services department ("purchasing division"), and the county's financial advisor, when appropriate for debt issuance, shall serve all of Hall County government by obtaining required commodities and services in accordance with State of Georgia law and this chapter.
B.
The purchasing manager shall, except as otherwise specified in this document, be responsible for the administration of all transactions governed by the provisions of this chapter and shall serve as the principal procurement officer of the county.
1.
Unless otherwise provided, any duties and powers of the purchasing manager may be delegated by him/her to subordinate purchasing staff members and other employees.
2.
The purchasing manager shall be subject to the authority and supervision of the director of financial services, who reports to the county administrator.
(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.110. - Procurement procedures.
A.
The purchasing manager, subject to the approval of the director of financial services, is authorized to establish, implement and enforce written standard operational procedures relating to acquisitions and dispositions subject to this chapter.
B.
Such procedures shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law and this chapter, be based upon generally accepted public purchasing principles and practices and shall become effective upon approval by the financial services director. These procedures may be revised as necessary though the same process, for their initial approval.
(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.120. - Improper purchasing.
The board of commissioners may disclaim responsibility and liability for any expenditure or agreement for expenditure arising from a procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this chapter or the authorization or delegation as provided in this chapter. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction shall become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly.
(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A))
3.10.130. - E-verification.
All contracts for the "physical performance of services" as defined in O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90, shall be procured and administered in compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 13-10-91.
(Res. of 11-14-19(1), § 1(Exh. A); Res. of 2-24-22(1) , § 3)
3.10.140. - Source selection.
A.
Pre-qualification process. No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the county from a prospective bidder who has not been prequalified on the procurement in question where the invitation for bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened.
1.
Public works construction contracts. The purchasing manager shall have the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f).

1.
Any commodity expected to cost or generate revenue of $50,000.00 or more shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, state the location where documents may be obtained, and state the date, time, and place of bid opening. Any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. Advertisements for formal sealed bids shall first be posted on the Hall County website and placed in The Gainesville Times for a minimum of one time for basic commodities and services and two times, two weeks apart for construction projects.
3.

b.
Prior to award, upon approval of the financial services director and county administrator, by providing a letter documenting facts supporting the reason for withdrawal within two business days of the bid opening.
c.
Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn.
i.
The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if request is made to withdraw the bid.
ii.
If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
5.
Bid corrections. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitation described below, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be clarified and/or corrected if the purchasing manager determines the clarification and/or correction to be in the county's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
a.
Price information; or
b.
Any required bonding.
6.
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
7.
Bid cancellation. An invitation for bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part, where it is in the best interest of the purchasing division, or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file.
8.
Bid award. The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bid. If the bid from the lowest responsible and responsive bidder exceeds the funds budgeted for the contract, the county may negotiate with such apparent low bidder to obtain a contact price within the budgeted amount. Such negotiations may include changes in the scope of work and other bid requirements.
9.
Responsive and responsible bidder. In evaluating the responsibility of a prospective contractor or person submitting a bid or whether the bid has been submitted by the "lowest responsible and responsive bidder", the purchasing agent or his/her designee shall have the discretion to evaluate factors that may include the following:
a.
The past contracting history, performance and experience with the county or county agent of the prospective contractor or person, or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person;
b.
Whether that prospective contractor or person or any identified subcontractor of the prospective contractor or person is currently on the State of Georgia's suspended or debarred suppliers list;
c.
The federal government's list of any debarred, suspended or ineligible contractors and/or any list of suspended, debarred or ineligible contractors maintained by another governmental entity including any other local government; and

11.
Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local firm if only one of the bidders has an office located in the boundaries of Hall County. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local firms, the purchasing division shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid.
12.
Formal evaluation period. During the formal evaluation period, the period of time between the bid submission and the time the pending award is approved by the Hall County Board of Commissioners, information related to the proposal may be limited.
13.
Hall County-based business. Hall County does not give preference to local businesses, but rather all competitive bids are graded based on qualifications and price.
C.
Competitive sealed proposal.
1.
When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by use of competitive sealed proposals. Use of the proposal method is dependent upon the following factors:

If the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with maintenance and service capabilities and the priorities needed to maintain the best interest of the county;

If the marketplace will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award;

Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $50,000.00; or
f.
Revenue is greater than $50,000.00.

4.
Request for qualifications. When deemed appropriate, the county may disseminate a request for qualifications. If this is the case, then the same procedures shall be followed as defined in this article for the request for proposals.
