ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development, both of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the governing authority's hearing on January 30, 2007; and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the governing authority on other occasions including the public hearing and meeting of the governing authority conducted on January 30, 2007, and on documentary evidence and the study submitted to the governing authority by Johnny Shirley, chief of police takes note of the well-known and self evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
(b)
It is the finding of the governing authority that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment, (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
(c)
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The governing authority finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well.
(d)
Furthermore, it is the finding of the governing authority that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
(e)
The governing authority finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the city has investigated the county's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county which revealed that a substantial amount of activity at a bookstore located within that county involved booths which an individual could enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths.
(f)
The governing authority therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the governing authority finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The governing authority finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

Secs. 4-14—4-44. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - VIDEO STORES

Sec. 4-45. - Regulations.
(a)
Findings.
(1)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dayton, Ohio, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the study submitted to the governing authority by Johnny Shirley, chief of police and based on documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by law enforcement personnel during the governing authority's public hearing and regular meeting on January 30, 2007, the governing authority takes note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films or videos depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the governing authority further notes that persons frequent such video viewing booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths.
(2)
The governing authority finds that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The governing authority therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in video stores be removed and that no holes be allowed to exist between adjoining booths. The governing authority finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in video stores. The governing authority further finds that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.
(b)
Requirements. Any video store having available for customers, patrons, or members, any booth, room, or cubicle for the private viewing of any video or motion picture must comply with the following requirements:
(1)

(2)
Construction. Every booth, room, or cubicle shall meet the following construction requirements:
a.
Each booth, room, or cubicle shall be separated from adjacent booths, rooms, and cubicles and any nonpublic areas by a wall.
b.

c.
All walls shall be solid and without openings, extended from the floor to a height of not less than six feet and be light colored, nonabsorbent, smooth-textured and easily cleanable.
d.
The floor must be light colored, nonabsorbent, smooth-textured and easily cleaned.

The lighting level of each booth, room, or cubicle when not in use shall be lighted by a minimum of a 100-watt clear glass electric light bulb at all times.

Definition of video store.

The term "video store" includes adult video stores as defined in section 4-2.
(d)
Enforcement. The provisions of this section may, in addition to any criminal remedy available, be enforced through an action for abatement of a nuisance in the manner provided by law.
