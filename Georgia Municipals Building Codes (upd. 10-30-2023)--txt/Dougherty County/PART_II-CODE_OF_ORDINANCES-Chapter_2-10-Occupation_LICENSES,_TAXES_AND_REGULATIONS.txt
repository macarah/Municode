(b)

Editor's note— Resolution No. 93-026, adopted September 8, 1993, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of §§ 1—21 as Ch. 2-10, Art. VIII, §§ 2-10-101—2-10-121 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-10-101. - Findings; public purpose.
The board of commissioners of Dougherty County, Georgia, (hereinafter, board of commissioners) finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments.

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish a balance between the protection afforded by the First Amendment and the public health, safety and welfare of the citizenry of Dougherty County, Georgia, and reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate government interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.
