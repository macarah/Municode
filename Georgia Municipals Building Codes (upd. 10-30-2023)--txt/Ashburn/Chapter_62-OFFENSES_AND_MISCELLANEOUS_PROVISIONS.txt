A person commits the offense of distributing obscene materials when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature of the materials, or offers to do so, or possesses such material with the intent to do so. The term "knowing" shall be deemed to be either actual or constructive knowledge of the obscene contents of the subject matter; and a person has constructive knowledge of the obscene contents if he has knowledge of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent person on notice as to the suspect nature of the material; however, the character and reputation of the individual charged with an offense under this law and, if a commercial dissemination of obscene material is involved, the character and reputation of the business establishment involved may be placed in evidence by the defendant on the question of intent to violate this section. Undeveloped photographs, molds, printing plates and the like shall be deemed obscene notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it.
(b)
Material is obscene if:
(1)
To the average person, applying contemporary community standards, taken as a whole, it predominantly appeals to the prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion;
(2)
The material taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value; and
(3)
The material depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined in this subsection (b)(3):
a.
Acts of sexual intercourse, heterosexual or homosexual, normal or perverted, actual or simulated;
b.
Acts of masturbation;
c.
Acts involving excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals;
d.
Acts of bestiality or the fondling of sex organs of animals; or
e.
Sexual acts of flagellation, torture or other violence indicating a sadomasochistic sexual relationship.
(c)
Any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the simulation of human genital organs is obscene material under this section.
(d)
Material not otherwise obscene may be obscene under this section if the distribution of the material, the offer to do so, or the possession with the intent to do so is a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal.
(e)
It is an affirmative defense under this section that dissemination of the material was restricted to:
(1)
A person associated with an institution of higher learning, either as a member of the faculty or a matriculated student, teaching or pursuing a course of study related to such material; or
(2)
A person whose receipt of such material was authorized in writing by a licensed medical practitioner or psychiatrist.
(f)
Any materials declared to be obscene by this section and advertisements for such materials are declared to be contraband.

Sec. 62-71. - Prohibited.
(a)
A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(b)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impractical, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(c)
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, loaf, wander, stand or remain idle, either alone and/or in consort with others, in a public place in such manner so as to:
(1)
Obstruct any public street, public highway, public sidewalk, or any other public place or building by hindering or impeding or tending to hinder or impede the free and uninterrupted passage of vehicles, traffic or pedestrians.
(2)
Commit in or upon any public street, public highway, public sidewalk or any other place or building any act or thing which is an obstruction or interference to the free and uninterrupted use of property or with any business lawfully conducted by anyone in or upon or facing or fronting on any such public street, public highway, public sidewalk or any other public place or building, all of which prevents the free and uninterrupted ingress, egress, regress in, on and to, such place or building.
(d)
When any person causes or commits any of the conditions enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, a police officer or any law enforcement officer shall order that person to stop causing or committing such conditions and to move on or disperse. Any person who fails or refuses to obey such orders shall be guilty of a violation of the section.
