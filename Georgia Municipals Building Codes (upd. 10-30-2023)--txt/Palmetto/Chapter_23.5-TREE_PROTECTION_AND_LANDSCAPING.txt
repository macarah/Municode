Chapter 23.5 - TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 23.5-1. - Purpose.
This chapter has been developed to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of the city. The intent is to create an opportunity for and to promote the protection of the city's natural resources and promote growth in a way that will provide a healthy environment for the city's future. The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for the protection of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; to protect trees during construction whenever possible; and to provide standards for existing residential and commercial property in order to enhance the quality of life within the city.
It shall be the duty of the city administrator or his/her designee to enforce the provisions and requirements of this chapter. The city administrator or his/her designee shall have the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any land disturbance permit and shall have the authority to suspend all work on a site or a portion thereof.

(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-3. - Applicability.
(a)
The terms and provisions of this chapter shall apply to existing residential and commercial property (see section 23.5-3) and to all activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit on any real property within the city (see section 23.5-2). No clearing, grubbing, grading, or other removal of existing vegetation that may effect the health of existing tree coverage may occur until it is determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable city codes and regulations.
(b)
Exemptions from the provisions of this article include the following project types:
(1)
Grandfathered projects. Any property included within the limits of a LDP (Land Disturbance Permit) approved prior to the effective date of this chapter, any remaining portion of a project where seventy-five (75) percent of the area has already been included in a LDP's approval prior to the effective date of this chapter.
(2)
Horticultural or agricultural operations. Land clearing for clearly agricultural purposes, including timber harvesting operations which qualify as forestry land management practices or agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17, as amended, on land zoned for or used for forestry, silvicultural, or agricultural purposes; plant or tree nurseries; orchards, are exempt.
This exemption shall not include tree harvesting incidental to the development of land, or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for non horticultural uses. Further, the operation of timber harvesting shall provide a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer measured from the right-of-way, provided and maintained along all road frontages, during the land disturbance activity, except for authorized access crossings to ensure the efficient operation of the city's street system and to protect the health and general welfare of persons using the city's street system. No timber harvesting shall be undertaken on any parcel of land unless the transitional buffer zones required by the zoning regulations of the district in which the property is located, are preserved in a natural and undisturbed state.
This chapter only regulates timber harvesting where such harvesting is incidental to development or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for non horticultural uses and recognizes the preemptive power of the State of Georgia with the regulation of legitimate timber harvesting as defined in this chapter.
(3)
The removal of diseased or infested trees. Removal upon advice and written finding of the county extension service, Georgia Forestry Commission, a certified arborist, or state registered urban forester.
The requirements of this chapter apply to each zoning classification. Any requirement can be applied or removed through conditions of zoning (see Code of the City of Palmetto, Appendix B, Zoning, Article XVII Residential Architectural Design Standards and Landscaping Requirements, sections 17-5, -10, -11, -12).
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)

Prior written notice of timber harvesting for each separate tract to be harvested thereby.
(2)
A map of the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested and, as to those trucks which will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, the main point of ingress to such tract from a public road and, if different, the main point of egress from such tract to a public road.
(3)
A statement as to whether the timber will be removed pursuant to a lump sum sale, per unit sale, or owner harvest for purposes of ad valorem taxation under O.C.G.A § 48-5-7.5.
(4)
The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest.
(5)
The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber.
The notice may be submitted in person, by transmission of an electronic record via facsimile or by mail.
The persons or firms subject to such notice requirement shall deliver a bond or letter of credit to the city, in which case notice shall not be or remain effective for such harvesting operations unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the city administrator or his/her designee a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting the city against any damage caused by such person or firm in an amount specified by the city not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) (O.C.G.A. § 12-6-24(b)(3)) or, at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber, a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of and in lieu of such bond. The surety bond or letter of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered.
The notice shall be effective for such harvesting operation on such tract within the city upon receipt of the same by the city or its designated agent and, if applicable, compliance with the above surety requirements of this chapter and until such time as the person or firm giving such notice has completed the harvesting operation for such tract; provided, however, that any subsequent change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice shall be reported to the city or its designated agent within three (3) business days after such change.
Violation of the notice requirements of this chapter shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00).

(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-5. - Timber harvesting development moratorium.
Once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations, no other land disturbing activities shall be permitted on the entire property for a period of six (6) months after completion of the tree harvesting operations. For purposes of this paragraph, the last date of tree harvesting shall be the last day in which a tree harvesting operation is conducted. The property owner who conducts a tree harvesting operation within the city shall be required, within thirty (30) days of the last day of tree harvesting operation, to deliver to the city administrator or his/her designee a written notice setting forth the last date of the tree harvesting operation and the identity and location of the property. Upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city administrator or his/her designee as provided above, the city administrator or his/her designee shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available. The property owner shall not be able to rebut this estimated date.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 1, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-6. - Zoning conditions and variances.
The city administrator or his/her designee, as part of the review team, will conduct a preliminary review of all rezoning cases, special use permit applications and variance requests. Conditions for approval will be applied where determined necessary by the preliminary review. These conditions may be either general, or specific in nature, and will reflect the standards or provisions of this chapter and the zoning ordinance. Compliance with these conditions will be verified by review of a revised site plan prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
Any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership violating any provision of this chapter shall be fined the maximum amount as provided for in the City of Palmetto's Charter and/or penalized as provided for in any ordinance which may be adopted by the city. Where an offense continues from day to day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense.

Secs. 23.5-7—23.5-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LAND DISTURBANCE PERMIT

Sec. 23.5-21. - Tree removal standards, guidelines and permitting procedures (property subject to a land disturbance permit).
(a)
A tree removal permit is required to remove any tree larger than eight (8) inches in diameter from any property that is subject to a land disturbance permit. The fee for obtaining a tree removal permit will be part of the land disturbance permit fee and will be based on the number of trees to be removed. Some tree removal permits may be granted without a tree removal fee in accordance with this chapter. If any specimen trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated. Minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in re-plantings.
(b)
Prior to the submission of any permit drawings, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the city administrator or his/her designee to discuss the tree protection and landscape ordinance as it relates to the applicant's property. The purpose of the pre-submittal conference is to clarify the provisions and procedures of this chapter and review applicable standards and guidelines for the submittal of documents, and required tree protection, replacement, and maintenance measures.
(c)
A tree protection and replacement plan shall be prepared and submitted with other permit drawings, as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process to the city administrator or his/her designee. These plans will be reviewed by the city administrator or his/her designee for compliance with the city zoning ordinance and this chapter in particular and either approved, denied, or returned for revisions. Any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings. The plans shall then be resubmitted (along with previous red line comments), with the necessary changes, following the same procedure as if it were an original application. Issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection and replacement plan.
(d)
An approved tree protection and replacement plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvements, he shall request an inspection by the city administrator or his/her designee. If the city administrator or his/her designee approves the installation, the project will be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the city administrator or his/her designee does not approve the plan, he shall submit a report stating his reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a re-inspection shall be requested.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-22. - Tree protection and replacement.
The trees in the City of Palmetto are a city resource worth protecting and maintaining. Existing trees on public property and rights-of-way shall not be disturbed, except as provided in this article. No person shall cut carve or otherwise damage any tree. No person shall attach rope, wire, nails, or advertising posters to any tree. No person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see section 23.5-6). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. "Reasonable effort" shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process.
In the plan review process of a proposed project, the first indicator of how well trees have been incorporated in the design process is how the proposed development impacts specimen trees. These trees are considered on an individual basis and a proposal to remove any of them is carefully scrutinized. Another indicator is how the proposed development impacts smaller, significant trees. These trees are typically considered in mass as they relate to the overall protection of the natural character of the site. Removals which are not adequately justified may require site plan alterations.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-23. - Planning and design consideration.
(a)
Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied:
(1)
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection.
(2)
The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area defined as the critical root zone.
(3)
The retention of native vegetation rather than invasive or exotic vegetation shall be prioritized. Existing native vegetation, forest litter and understory plants shall be preserved to the extent possible in order to reduce flow velocities and encourage sheet flow on the site.
(4)
Tree protection and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. A grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree, yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention should be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills. Tree wells and/or aeration systems can also be provided for trees in areas of fill.
(5)
Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones. Developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines, including irrigation and electric lighting, with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones.
(6)
Construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the city administrator or his/her designee.
(7)
Sidewalks often appear innocuous on plans, but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements. Considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk. Drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 3, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-24. - Protection of existing trees.
(a)
Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to:
(1)
Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials;
(2)
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching;
(3)
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment; and
(4)
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc.
(b)
Existing trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have a four-foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones. For methods of tree protection, see subsections (d)(1) through (6) of this section. Tree protection devices shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed. No construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas. Areas designated for parking, materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees.
(c)
The city administrator or his/her designee will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this chapter. Tree protection measures must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the city administrator or his/her designee.
(d)
Methods of tree protection. The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction. These guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots, trunks, and limbs by chemical, mechanical, and other means. Tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed.
(1)
Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the city administrator or his/her designee. Barriers will be a minimum four (4) feet high. Construction of the fence shall conform to the detail provided in Appendix B. All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and shall not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete.
(2)
Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their critical root zones not within sixty (60) feet of any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four-foot orange plastic safety fencing or continuous plastic flagging. Tree protection materials shall consist of heavy mil, plastic flagging, a minimum four inches in width with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area. Do Not Enter." or equivalent signage on a continuous durable restraint. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity.
(3)
Boring. No open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a twenty-four-inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method.
(4)
Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation.
(5)
Clearing adjacent to tree save areas. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g., with a ditch witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees.
(6)
Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation, all roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable.
(7)
Paving limitations. Construction of sidewalks or permeable parking access points may encroach into tree protection zones, so long as such areas are approved by the city administrator or his or her designee and the following conditions are met:
a.
No more than ten (10) percent of the protected critical root zone may be covered by sidewalks, up to twenty (20) percent of this area may be covered by permeable parking areas or permeable driveway access points or a combination of sidewalks and permeable parking or permeable driveway access areas.
b.
Sidewalks shall be raised to avoid root damage, private sidewalks may be constructed with asphalt if a concrete or brick sidewalk would damage the trees roots; and
c.
Permeable paving shall provide water and gaseous exchange to the tree roots, and the existing grade shall not be lowered or raised, except that the finished paved surface may be an average of size inches above the existing grade.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 4, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-25. - Determination of site density factors.
(a)
All projects within the city, with the exception of the construction of individual single-family and detached dwellings, shall maintain in perpetuity or exceed a minimum site density factor of twelve (12) units per acre.
Minimum tree site density shall be calculated as shown below:

Total acres       25
-Area of buffers       5
Net area       20 acres
  Required Minimum Site Density = 12 units × 20 acres = 240 units required.
(b)
The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, and or planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. Unit values are computed as provided at Appendix C.
(c)
Existing and proposed trees outside established zoning buffers can be used for density credit. Proposed trees shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards.
(d)
The minimum sized existing tree that will count toward tree density credit is eight (8) inches caliper dbh (eight (8) inches). All existing trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried as specified in Appendix C.
(e)
New trees shall be provided utilizing a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of 1 to 3. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development.
(f)
Individual single-family lots, with four or less residential units per acre are required to provide a site density factor of two (2) tree units per acre. This density shall be achieved by planting a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of 1 to 3 with a minimum of one (1) shade/canopy required. Shade/canopy trees shall be at least ten (10) feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three (3) caliper inches. Understory shall be at least six (6) feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two (2) caliper inches. Fifty (50) percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. All residential lots shall require that improvements be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. Existing trees that are protected and saved on the lot can be credited toward the lot density requirement as well as the overall subdivision requirement.
(g)
Where the proposed development area is considered infill development or is so dense that the minimum site density factor cannot reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings, or plant and maintain replacement trees off site at locations to be approved by the city.
(h)
Any tree, designated on the tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the city administrator or his/her designee, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged.
(i)
Trees which are used to meet the tree density requirements shall be maintained for two (2) years after the date of final inspection and kept in perpetuity in all zoning classifications. It is the responsibility of the property owner to water and fertilize trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this chapter.
(j)
The developer/owner shall guarantee all plant materials for a minimum of two (2) years from implementation. The city administrator or his/her designee shall inspect said improvements and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. The owner shall be notified by letter of any replacements or restoration that must be made to maintain compliance with this article. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced within forty-five (45) days in conformance with the approved landscaping plan.
(k)
Where the city administrator or his/her designee determines that minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, the number of trees to be planted or maintained on a site or lot shall be determined by the city administrator or his/her designee based on site review. Thereafter, the owner/developer/builder shall, with the concurrence of the city administrator or his/her designee, provide the remaining balance of required trees to be planted on city property, including rights-of-way of existing streets. When this approach is exercised, the city shall first determine the variety, size, and number of trees to be furnished by the owner/developer/builder. The city will then obtain prices from a minimum of two (2) plant nurseries and/or landscape contractors, selected by the city to supply and plant the required plant materials. Prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, an amount equal to the lower of the bid prices will be paid by the owner/developer/builder to the city. The city, at its option, may elect to proceed to have planting done on city land or right-of-way or to hold these funds until more suitable planting conditions prevail. Upon payment, the owner/developer/builder will be relieved of any further responsibility for the fulfillment of these requirements for the subject property.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 5, 5-4-2015; Ord. No. 2017-02 , § 1, 3-6-2017)
Sec. 23.5-26. - Specimen trees.
(a)
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them (see section 23.5-22). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. "Reasonable effort" shall include, but not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees.
(b)
The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify:
(1)
Size criteria:
a.
Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): twenty-four-inch (24″) diameter or larger.
b.
Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): thirty-inch (30″) diameter or larger.
c.
Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.): eight-inch (8″) diameter or larger.
(2)
Condition criteria:
a.
Life expectancy of more than fifteen (15) years.
b.
Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay.
c.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
d.
No major insect or pathological problem.
(c)
Replacement of specimen trees:
(1)
In the event any specimen trees are to be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace the specimen trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality.
(2)
Specimen tree replacement will be required, in addition to the minimum required tree density requirements.
(3)
Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, and equal to the unit value of the specimen tree removed. To determine if the replacement is reasonable the city administrator or his/her designee shall consider the intended use of:
a.
Existing tree coverage, size, and type;
b.
Number of trees to be removed on the entire property;
c.
Number of trees to be saved on the entire property;
d.
Area to be covered with structures, parking, and driveways;
e.
Grading and drainage requirements; and
f.
Character of the site and its environs.
(4)
Disturbance or encroachment into the critical root zone of a specimen tree exceeding thirty (30) percent of the root zone will constitute the loss of the tree and require recompense as described in subsection (c)(3), above.
(5)
In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than twenty-four (24) months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) equal to the unit value of the specimen tree.
(6)
Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city administrator or his/her designee must be replaced by trees equaling a two times the unit value of the specimen tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be four-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city administrator or his/her designee.

Sec. 23.5-27. - Parking lot tree requirements.
(a)
Parking lots containing ten (10) or more parking spaces shall be landscaped as indicated below. All trees planted to satisfy parking lot requirements can be applied to site density requirements.
(b)
Trees shall be provided and maintained adjacent to and in the interior of parking lots in the ratio of one tree for each five (5) parking spaces. In addition each parking space shall be within sixty (60) feet of the trunk of a tree.
(c)
Trees provided to comply with this section shall be deciduous shade trees from Appendix "A" Large Canopy/Shade Tree List and shall be at least two and one-half (2½) caliper inches at the time of planting.
(d)
Parking lot planting.
(1)
There shall be a minimum curb radii of three feet required on the corners of all landscape islands and medians to allow for free movement of motor vehicles around planting materials. Although innovative storm water management techniques are strongly encouraged, all islands and medians shall have raised curbs unless other storm water management techniques are approved.
(2)
Striping of parking islands is not permitted.
(3)
Parking lot lighting shall be coordinated with the tree locations in the parking lot.
(4)
At the end of all rows of parking a terminal landscape island or area shall be provided to protect parked vehicles, confine moving traffic to aisles and driveways, and provide space for landscaping. A terminal island for a single row of parking spaces shall be planted with a least one canopy/shade tree. A terminal island for a double row of parking spaces shall contain two shade/canopy trees.
(5)
All landscape islands within parking lots shall be one hundred (100) percent landscaped with deciduous trees, evergreen shrubs or native grasses (not to exceed three (3) feet high at maturity unless part of an approved low impact development stormwater feature), ground cover (which does not require mowing) and/or flowers in mulched beds).
(6)
Parking areas designated to comply with this section must install landscape islands so that no more than ten (10) adjacent parking spaces exist without a landscaped island.
(7)
All landscape islands shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking lot.
(8)
Parking lot islands shall have a minimum width of eight (8) feet measured from back of curb to back of curb and be equal in length to the adjoining parking space.
(9)
Landscaped areas between parking areas and buildings shall not be considered as interior landscaping.
(10)
Areas used principally for storage of vehicles or display areas do not require interior islands if such areas are screened from adjacent properties and public streets.
(11)
The perimeter of all parking areas shall be landscaped as a minimum with groundcover or turf.
(12)
Where parking lots abut a public right-of-way a ten-foot wide landscape strip shall be provided back from the property line. The strip shall contain a continuous evergreen hedge to screen the parking lot. Plantings in the hedge should be spaced such that a continuous hedge is created within three (3) years of planting. The hedge shall not exceed three (3) feet in height or block vehicular site distance at the site entry. This requirement shall be coordinated with any requirement of section 23.5-28 when requirements overlap. Parking lots are considered not to abut a public right-of-way if constructed at a distance exceeding the setback distance.
(13)
Where parking lots abut side or rear property lines or differing uses within mixed use developments the strip shall contain a continuous evergreen hedge to screen the parking lot. When a parking lot abuts an undisturbed zoning buffer this requirement is not applicable. Parking lots are considered not to abut a side or rear property line if constructed at a distance exceeding the setback distance.
(14)
Trees shall be planted at a minimum of three (3) feet from any curb or edge of pavement, so as to prevent injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the striping between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Curb stops must be used to prevent vehicle overhang into required landscape strips and parking islands when curbing is not used.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 6, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-28. - Landscape planting strip requirements.
(a)
Landscape strips shall be used to enhance the public appearance of any non residential property located along a public right-of-way. The following minimum requirements shall apply to landscape planting strips:
(b)
Landscape strips.
(1)
Landscape plantings shall be provided in a landscape strip of at least ten (10) feet in width adjacent to any street right-of-way abutting the property and running the length of the entire property frontage, or as required by a condition of zoning, special use or variance approval.

(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 7, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-29. - Buffers.
(a)
As directed by the Palmetto Zoning Ordinance, buffers are required to achieve a visual barrier between properties of different use. However, existing or proposed plant material located within a buffer cannot be applied toward density requirements of a site. The area of a buffer can be subtracted from the total area of a site when calculating density requirements.
(b)
Buffer widths shall be as indicated in the zoning ordinance or as allowed by variance or zoning conditions. Unless otherwise directed by zoning or this chapter buffers shall remain undisturbed. When existing vegetation exists in a buffer it shall be protected from encroachment during construction.
(c)
Where buffers are void of existing vegetation adequate enough to provide a visual barrier or the buffers have been violated, the owner/developer is responsible for replanting. A formula based on the square footage of the entire buffer or portion thereof that is void of adequate material will be applied.
(d)
The City of Palmetto encourages the control or elimination of invasive plant material including Chinese privet, kudzu, wisteria, etc. Selective clearing in buffers to remove noxious or invasive plant material and the methods of removal will require the approval of the city administrator or his/her designee. Selective buffer clearing will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Removal of material may require the replanting to buffer standards if the buffer is over cleared.
Type I Buffer shall be applied to all buffers less than fifty (50) feet wide:
The following plant material shall be provided per one thousand (1,000) square feet of buffer area to be vegetated.
1 Shade/Canopy trees
5 Evergreen understory trees
15 large evergreen shrubs
EXAMPLE 1: 50 FOOT BUFFER
1750 sf Buffer area
1.75 × 1 tree = 2 trees
1.75 × 5 Understory trees = 9 trees
1.75 × 15 Large shrubs = 26 shrubs
Round up when quantity exceeds .5
Type II Buffer shall be applied to all buffers fifty (50) feet wide and more:
The following plant material shall be provided per one thousand (1,000) square feet of buffer area to be vegetated.
1 Shade/Canopy trees
5 Evergreen understory trees
15 large evergreen shrubs
EXAMPLE 2: 100 FOOT BUFFER
3500 sf Buffer area
3.5 × 1 tree = 4 trees
3.5 × 5 Understory trees = 18 trees
3.5 × 15 Large shrubs = 53 shrubs
Round up when quantity exceeds .5
Minimum tree sizes upon installation in both Type I and Type II Buffers are as follows:
Canopy/shade tree size: 2-inch caliper
Understory evergreen: 6 feet high
Large shrub size 24″ high
In addition to the material required for the Type II Buffer, a continuous six-foot high opaque wood fence shall be installed at the property line along the entire buffer when no effective vegetation exists.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-30. - Screening.
Screening shall consist of the visual blocking of views of onsite service equipment and areas. The following items shall be screened as indicated below.
(1)
Dumpster and trash storage/collection areas shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjacent properties regardless of adjacent land use or zoning classification. Enclosures must be constructed of the same exterior wall material used for the building. The enclosure shall be a foot higher than what is contained in the interior.
(2)
Loading/service areas shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible from any streets and/or adjacent properties. These areas shall be screened using upright evergreen plantings, six (6) feet tall at the time of installation, spaced at a maximum of eight (8) feet on center.
(3)
Heating and cooling units for all developments including single-family shall be adequately screened with vegetation so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjoining properties.
(4)
Non-amenity detention ponds and other related storm water management facilities shall be screened from view by a continuous evergreen screen thirty-six (36) inches tall at the time of installation and maintained at a minimum height of forty-two (42) inches. Maintenance access may remain open but arranged to prevent direct view into the facility. Innovative stormwater solutions such as bioretention areas or bioswales may be exempt from the requirement of the continuous evergreen screen with approval of the city administrator or his/her designee.
(5)
Plants shall be spaced so as to provide for effective visual screening within three (3) growing seasons.

d.
A MAINTENANCE INSPECTION OF TREES WILL BE PERFORMED AFTER TWO FULL GROWING SEASONS FROM THE DATE OF THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION. PROJECT OWNERS AT THE TIME OF THE MAINTENANCE INSPECTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDINANCE COMPLIANCE.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 9, 5-4-2015)
Sec. 23.5-33. - Maintenance.
After two (2) full growing seasons from the date of the inspection of new tree installations, the city administrator or his/her designee will inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the required tree site density factor which are dead or near death must be replaced.
Trees preserved to meet the required site densities which are dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced. Trees which are used to meet the requirements for this chapter shall be maintained for twenty-four (24) months after the date of the final inspection. Maintenance on replacement trees will be required for an additional two (2) years.
It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject to this chapter to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Planting beds shall be mulched to prevent weed growth and maintain soil moisture. Plant materials shall be pruned as required to maintain good health and character. Turf areas shall be mowed periodically.

The property owner is responsible for the control of this material and may be subject to a fine if these areas are not maintained.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-34. - Maintenance bonds.
modified
New tree plantings or existing protected trees used to meet the density requirements of this section for commercial developments shall be maintained for two (2) years after the date of final inspection and shall require the posting of a maintenance bond by the applicant. All maintenance bonds shall be in an amount equal to one-third (⅓) of the estimated cost of replacement of the newly planted or existing protected trees; provided, however, that if the applicant has previously failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, the city may require that the amount of the bond be equal to fifty (50) percent of the estimated cost to replace the newly planted or existing protected trees.
(1)
During the period of the two-year maintenance bond, the city administrator or his/her designee shall have the right to conduct periodic inspections during normal business hours in order to confirm the health and viability of all required trees.
(2)
If the city administrator or his/her designee finds that trees planted or protected to meet the required site density are dead or near death, the city administrator or his/her designee shall so notify the applicant and the applicant shall replace those trees with trees of similar size within thirty (30) days of notification. The failure of the applicant to timely plant any such replacement trees shall result in forfeiture of the maintenance bond.
(3)
Not sooner than one hundred eighty (180) days nor later than one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond, the applicant shall petition the city administrator or his/her designee to release the maintenance bond. Upon receipt of the petition, the city administrator or his/her designee shall inspect the project to determine the health and viability of all required trees. If the city administrator or his/her designee finds that trees need to be replaced, the city administrator or his/her designee shall so notify the applicant and the applicant shall timely perform such additional work necessary to comply with the tree density requirements. The failure of the applicant to timely replace the trees specified by the city administrator or his/her designee may result in forfeiture of the maintenance bond. Upon the city administrator or his/her designee's final determination that all required trees are healthy, the city administrator or his/her designee shall so notify the applicant, and the maintenance bond shall be released.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)
Sec. 23.5-35. - Performance bonds.
New tree plantings used to meet the density requirement of this chapter for commercial or residential developments may be postponed for up to six (6) months provided that a performance bond is obtained. The basis for delay must be that either planting stock availability is low or weather conditions are not appropriate for planting new trees. All performance bonds shall be submitted to the city with appropriate documentation and justification of low plant stock availability and/or adverse weather conditions.
(Ord. No. 09-02, 4-6-09)

This section pertains to tree removal for reasons other than land development.
(1)
Safety standards. The property owner, whether individually or through a contractor, engaged in tree removal shall be solely responsible for pedestrian and vehicular safety and control within the work site and shall provide the necessary warning devices, barricades, and ground personnel needed to give safety, protection, and warning within the area where tree removal or pruning is to occur. Blocking of public streets shall not be permitted unless prior arrangements have been made with the city administrator or his/her designee. Traffic control shall be accomplished in conformance with state, county and local highway construction codes.
(2)
Debris and logs shall not be left on the public right-of-way overnight. The property owner shall be the responsible for disposal of, in a proper and acceptable manner, all logs, brush and debris resulting from the tree removal operation. No burying of debris will be allowed on site. No burning will be allowed on site without prior approval by the city administrator or his/her designee.
(3)
It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property bordering on any street upon which property there may be trees, to prune such trees in such a manner that they will not obstruct or shade street lights, obstruct passage of pedestrians on sidewalks, obstruct vision of traffic signs, or obstruct views of any street intersection. Any trees that are diseased or insect infested shall be removed, sprayed, or treated in such a manner that they will not infect or damage nearby public vegetation or cause harm to the community or citizens therein. The city administrator or his/her designee may order trees on private land that cause obstructions, present insect or disease problems, or otherwise present a danger to public health or safety be pruned, removed, or treated.
