(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 8-7-06)
Sec. 1-2. - Purpose and intent.
The mayor and council for the City of Palmetto understands that signs are an integral part of the ability of every person to exercise their right to freedom of speech. It is however, important to understand that there is a fundamental need to protect Palmetto as a whole from the unchecked proliferation of unregulated signage. It is with this understanding in mind that the mayor and council for the City of Palmetto provides the following purposes for the regulation of signage:
1.
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city;
2.
To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth;
3.
To improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
4.
To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property;
5.
And to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions.
This sign ordinance is adopted under the authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the code of ordinances.
