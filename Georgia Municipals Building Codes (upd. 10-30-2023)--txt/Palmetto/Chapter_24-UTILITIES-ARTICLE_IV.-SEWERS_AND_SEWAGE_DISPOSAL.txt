(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-134. - Permits.
(a)
Construction permit. No portion of a pretreatment system shall be installed, repaired, altered, modified, or replaced until a pretreatment construction permit has been issued by the city. A fee will be required for review of plans. Permits issued for new construction shall become void eighteen (18) months after the date of issuance if the system has not been installed. However, if building construction has commenced, the system construction permit shall be valid for an additional ninety (90) calendar days beyond the eighteen-month expiration date. Permits for system repairs shall become void after ninety (90) calendar days from the date of issuance. A construction or repair permit for a pretreatment system shall be transferred to another person if the transferee files an amended application providing all corrected information and proof of ownership of the property or tenant occupancy within sixty (60) calendar days after the transfer of ownership, and all information pertaining to the sitting, location, and installation conditions or repair of a pretreatment system remains the same. There is no fee associated with the processing to the transfer. The date of the construction or repair permit shall not be amended, but shall run from the date of original issuance prior to the transfer.
(b)
Construction revision permit. The applicant shall be the permit holder and shall be held responsible for all information supplied to the city. The signed application, site evaluation, and system design plans when required, serve as the basis by which the city determines the issuance of a construction permit. In the event of a change in any information given in the application which served as basis for issuing a construction permit, the permit holder will immediately file an amended application detailing such changed conditions. If the new conditions are determined to be in compliance with city engineering standards, the construction permit shall be amended. If the new conditions are determined to be in noncompliance with the city engineering standards, the permit shall no longer be valid.
(c)
Commercial waste permit. A permit shall be required by any commercial waste generator discharging to the city sanitary sewer and publicly owned treatment works. The permit will be valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance and is not transferable. The permit must be placed in a location visible to inspections. If the owner of a pretreatment system remains the same but the ownership of the building changes, a site tenant is still operating within the permit guidelines. No new building tenant shall open for business until the city has approved the change of tenancy and inspected the pretreatment system to see if it is still within the guidelines of the original operating permit (see section 24-140).
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-135. - Pretreatment inspections.
(a)
New construction. Before covering with earth and before placing a pretreatment system into service, a person/company installing or constructing any portion of a pretreatment system shall notify the city prior to completion of the construction activities and shall have the system inspected by the city for compliance with the requirements of this division. A final inspection fee will be required. The city shall make every reasonable effort to make a complete inspection of system construction, modification, replacement, or alteration within two (2) working days after notification to the city that the system is ready for inspection. A repair shall be inspected by the city to determine compliance with construction permit standards prior to final covering of the system. If the system constructed is approved by the city, an "inspection approval" notice will be given to the installer. If the system installation does not pass the construction inspection, then the installer shall make all required corrections and notify the city within seven (7) calendar days for a re-inspection of the system. A re-inspection fee shall be charged to the installer for additional inspection(s) if the contractor has failed to correct the items an inspector has required at the preliminary inspection. Final installation approval shall not be granted until the city has confirmed that the installation is in compliance with plans and specifications submitted with the permit application. If no final construction inspection can be documented of the commercial waste generators pretreatment system, then the certificate of occupancy on the project will not be released.
(b)
Existing pretreatment systems. The city will perform an annual inspection of all pretreatment systems permitted to operate in the city. The inspections will be conducted to make sure the commercial waste generator is following the maintenance criteria set forth in this division and the waste generator is operating under the conditions of the permit. Those facilities found in non-compliance will be required to correct all violations within seven (7) calendar days of notification. However, if the violation requires a repair, replacement, or installation of a pretreatment system, then the commercial waste generator will have forty-five (45) calendar days to comply. All repairs, replacement, and installations will require approval by the city.
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-136. - Location and installation.
(a)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed closest to the discharge source of the commercial waste. A subsurface pretreatment system must be located or installed no more than fifty (50) feet from the discharge source. A subsurface pretreatment system installed beyond fifty (50) feet must have approval by the city.
(b)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed so that proper maintenance of the system does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and does not impact the environment.
(c)
Pretreatment systems must be located and installed so that they are accessible for maintenance. No heavy kitchen equipment, canisters, dumpsters, or trash compactors can block access to the pretreatment system.
(d)
Interior grease traps will be installed at the point source such as a 3-4 compartment sink, dishwasher, or any kitchen equipment where grease must be collected prior to discharge to the building waste line. Interior grease traps will be located above the floor. Recessed grease traps must have prior approval for installation. All interior grease traps must have a flow control valve and a vent. The flow control valve shall be placed on the inlet side of the grease trap. The vent line will take all odors out of the building.
(e)
Pretreatment systems installed and located so as to experience a rusting of parts (e.g., pretreatment system located under a kitchen sink) which may impair the opening of the system for inspection, will require the commercial waste generator to provide access to the system. If the commercial waste generator cannot provide access, then they will be in violation. The inspector can require that the unit be replaced if it has deteriorated from corrosion.
(f)
Pretreatment systems installed and located on the outside of a building will discharge to the sanitary sewer line. The test manhole is the last discharge point of the pretreatment system before the sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer connection from the pretreatment system will not be allowed to connect to the site sanitary sewer line by going under or through the building. The connection to the sanitary sewer line must be kept to the exterior of the building structure. The connection from the building to the pretreatment system will be a direct straight line. One (1) ninety or forty-five (45) degree angle will be allowed with a clean out if a straight line is not obtainable. The test manhole will be located a maximum of four (4) feet from the last tank in the pretreatment system and must have an invert in the test manhole. Prefab concrete or brick construction is allowed.
(g)
All pretreatment systems installed subsurface in multi-level parking decks must be located on the ground level of the structure and must be located so they are accessible for maintenance and inspection.
(h)
Installation of an alternative interior pretreatment system will be allowed for commercial waste generators where an upgrade, repair, or installation of a pretreatment system is required and a subsurface system is not possible. However, the commercial waste generator must meet the following criteria for an alternative pretreatment system to be installed:
(1)
The facility must be located in an existing building structure that is fifteen (15) years or older, where written documentation is submitted by a licensed engineer, contractor, or master plumber to verify a subsurface pretreatment system is impossible to install due to existing underground utilities;
(2)
The facility is not located in new commercial development;
(3)
The facility provides written documentation by a licensed engineer, contractor, or master plumber that the sanitary sewer tie-in of a subsurface pretreatment system cannot be reached by the installer; and
(4)
The facility's pretreatment system is found to be inadequate and an alternative system will upgrade the current pretreatment system to bring the facility into compliance.
(i)
Any subsurface pretreatment system requiring installation of more than one (1) single tank will lace the tanks in tandem and in one (1) single line. The multiple tanks must be installed so the commercial waste from the building will flow from tank to tank. The distance from tank to tank will not be greater than twelve (12) inches.
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-137. - Design of pretreatment system.
Oil water separators, grease traps, and sand traps will be required for commercial and industrial establishments as a pretreatment system where it is determined by the city that they are necessary to prevent oil and grease waste discharge to the sanitary sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the sewer system and the city's publicly owned treatment works. The user shall submit plans to the city for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the city's inspection prior to placing in service.
(1)
Subsurface pretreatment systems shall comply with the structural requirements as indicated on the Fulton County standard 671 or 671A and this division. All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well as the current plumbing code used by the city.
(2)
For the sizing of pretreatment systems by specific generators source, refer to generator source charts, tables I and II. Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be:
a.
Inadequate for the facility's current operation.
b.
In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals that an upgrade or repair is required.
c.
Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the city, or clean up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair.
d.
Installed incorrectly and not per the plumbing code used by the city or engineering standards. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced.
(3)
Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system (refer to standard detail 671). The concrete lid of the tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two (2) feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled.
(4)
Any three thousand (3,000) gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two (2) sections provided the center section has been sealed properly so that no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be three thousand (3,000) gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All three thousand (3,000) gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two (2) manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or their equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two (2) sections if the tank is less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as baffle wall. A three-inch to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two (2) feet from the bottom of the tank (refer to standard detail 671).
(5)
A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system (see Fulton County standard 650).
(6)
Each installed subsurface pretreatment systems must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification and the gallon (GPM) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify the type and size of the tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed.
(7)
All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four (4) feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two (2) feet. The brick work will be three (3) feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once eighty (80) percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, the user must corbel in the brickwork in small increments (see Fulton County standard 650).
(8)
An alternate interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the city. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the city for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required.
(9)
A grease trap is used for the collection of kitchen waste discharge only. It cannot be used to collect discharge from can wash areas, dumpsters, mop sinks, food grinders, food coolers, or floor drains in mechanical rooms or bathrooms. Commercial waste generators that have micro-brewery facilities may be subject to additional discharge requirements (see Appendix B3 Food Service Piping Layout).
(10)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria, or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable pretreatment system.
(11)
It shall constitute a violation of this division to introduce chemicals and/or acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils, and grease to the extent that such material later solidifies in the city sewer lines or pump stations or in the publicly owned treatment works. If a commercial waste generator uses enzymes and bacteria for pretreatment maintenance and it is discovered that said substances causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of the publicly owned treatment works, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential health hazard, then these additives will be prohibited. Use of any other substances, including special enzymes and bacteria is solely at the discretion of the commercial waste generator.
(12)
Grit and sand traps and oil water separators shall be installed in accordance to the current official plumbing code used by the city engineering standards (refer to the commercial waste generator source table II in this division).
(13)
Any strip retail shopping center or office building showing subsurface pretreatment systems at designated buildings or structures will only be allowed discharge by a single tenant or food service to that system. No multiple users will be allowed. The only exception to this condition is a shopping mall with a food court where pretreatment systems are installed and maintained by the mall corporation or management leasing.

(8)
Abandoning, without good cause, a project in which a contractor is engaged or is under contractual obligation to perform shall be a violation of this division. The failure of a contractor to perform work without just cause for ninety (90) consecutive days shall create a presumption that the contractor has abandoned the project.
(9)
Gross negligence, incompetence, or misconduct which causes monetary or other harm to a customer or physical harm to any person shall be a violation of this division. An example of such a violation would be the illegal disposal of a generator's waste when repairing a pretreatment system.
(10)
It shall be a violation of this division if a pretreatment system is installed by someone other than a licensed contractor or master plumber.
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-144. - Notification of violation.
When the designated city representative finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a commercial waste permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the designated city representative may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the designated city representative. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the designated city representative to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-145. - Violations and penalties.
When the designated city representative finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a commercial waste permit or any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the designated city representative may issue a citation to such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punished accordingly.
(1)
Unpaid citations shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty-five (25) percent. Failure by the generator to pay a designated citation thirty (30) business days after the citation has been issued shall result in the revocation of the generator's commercial waste permit.
(2)
Issuance of a citation shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action.
(3)
The following shall be considered violations of this division and the responsible person or company will be assessed fines accordingly:
a.
It shall be a violation of this division for a licensed contractor, engineer, or plumber to install, modify, or repair a pretreatment system without a pretreatment permit or to work on the installation of a pretreatment system and obtain a permit after work has commenced. It shall also be a violation if no inspections are performed.
b.
It shall be a violation of this division for a commercial waste generator to have a pretreatment system installed without submitting plans for review. It shall also be a violation if installation of a system is completed and no permit application is received or on file and if no final inspections of the project are performed.
c.
Failure to call for required inspection(s) when a renovation or upgrade of a pretreatment system is required shall be a violation of this division.
d.
A commercial waste generator shall be in violation of this division if it fails to maintain its pretreatment system.
e.
A commercial waste generator shall be in violation of this division if it fails to provide the city with a manifest or maintenance documentation for its pretreatment system.
f.
A commercial waste generator shall be in violation of this division if it fails to inform the city that a spill has occurred during pumping of a pretreatment system and the spill impacts the sanitary sewer, storm drain, or environment.
g.
A commercial waste generator shall be in violation of this division if it fails to apply for the required commercial waste permit for a pretreatment system in the city.
(4)
Any violations do negate their existence. The city shall have the right to use other laws that may be applicable when determining violations.
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 12-1-08)
Sec. 24-146. - Citations and administrative appeal.
(a)
Citations:
(1)
Citations shall be issued when the commercial waste generator fails to correct the same violation after a notice of violation has been issued and the commercial waste generator demonstrates willful neglect or non-compliance with this division. Any citations issued shall be paid in thirty (30) calendar days from the date of issuance. A citation must be in writing and must describe the particular nature of the violation, including specific references to the provisions of this division violated and the time frame for correction. Refusal of the citation will not negate its issuance.
(b)
Administrative appeal:
(1)
Generators desiring to dispute citations must file a written request for the designated city representative to reconsider the citation along with full payment of the citation amount within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of issuance. Where a request has merit, the designated city representative may convene a hearing on the matter. If the citation has been paid and the designated city representative rules in favor of the generator, all money shall be returned to the generator. If the recipient fails to execute its right to contest the citation, the city will conclude that the recipient has waived its right and the recipient must pay the initial citation fine and/or the maximum fine.
(2)
The city may reduce or waive the fine imposed by the citation after consideration of the gravity of the violation, the recipient's attempts at correcting the violation, and the commercial waste generator's history of previous violations. However, violations that occur due to a spill or an illegal discharge to the city sanitary sewer system will not be waived or reduced.
