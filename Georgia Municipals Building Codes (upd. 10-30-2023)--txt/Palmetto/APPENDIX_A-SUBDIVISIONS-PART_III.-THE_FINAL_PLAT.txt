Sec. C. - Lot lines.
Side lot lines should generally be at right angles or radial to street rights-of-way. In cul-de-sacs, side lot lines should be radial to the center point of the cul-de-sac. When a more efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions or improved building sites can be achieved by a reasonable lot pattern which does not fully adhere to the desirable side lot line configuration defined in this paragraph, the planning and zoning board will allow the alternate lot pattern unless specific objections are noted.
Sec. D. - Front-yard setback lines.
A line meeting the front-yard setback requirements of the zoning ordinance shall be established on all lots.
Sec. E. - Through or double-frontage lots.
Through or double-frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography.
A buffer strip at least ten (10) feet wide, planted with evergreen trees or shrubs that grow at least eight (8) feet tall and provide an effective visual screen, with no right of access, shall be required along the portion of a lot abutting such traffic artery or other incompatible use.
Sec. F. - Block and lot easements.
Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided, as required, for utilities.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, natural channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming substantially to the limits of such watercourse plus additional width as necessary to accommodate future construction, as required by the planning and zoning board, but not to exceed the one-hundred-year intermediate regional floodplain, plus five (5) feet horizontally. Parallel streets may be required by the planning and zoning board in connection with the above easements.

Turning lanes: Turning lanes shall be required by the city to meet projected traffic demand and/or safe operations. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the following criteria:
(a)
Provide no less than one hundred fifty (150) feet of storage length for arterial roadways. Provide not less than one hundred (100) feet of storage length for collector roadways.
(b)
Provide taper lengths of not less than fifty (50) feet.
(c)
Longer storage and taper lengths may be required when traffic projections indicated they are justified.
(9)
Cul-de-sac streets: Existing and future street connections are encouraged to eliminate the number of new culs-de-sac to be maintained by the city and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract and adjoining parcels. Culs-de-sac are appropriate when they support greater open space conservation or provide extensive pedestrian linkages. Cul-de-sac streets shall be designed so that the maximum desirable length is eight hundred (800) feet, but no longer than one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet, including circular turn around. Where feasible, cul-de-sacs shall incorporate a pervious or bioretention landscaped area in the center.
(10)
Street length: Minimize subdivision roadway length by using a roadway layout with the least pavement length suitable for the site's topography and other planning goals.
(11)
Circulation and access:
(a)
Circulation and access provisions shall be appropriate to the scale of the project and to anticipated traffic characteristics, and consistent with the requirements of the city road standards. Deviations from these standards may be granted where a bioretention swale with compost mended soils shall be provided within the right-of-way or easement dedicated to the City of Palmetto adjacent to the public right-of-way or in islands created by loop roadways.
(b)
The use of common driveway access may be provided and is encouraged. Shared and common driveways provide the required traveled path to or through a parking lot for multiple single-family dwellings, multifamily structures, and commercial developments. These "driveways" provide vehicular access for a single family, multifamily and commercial developments. All areas identified within developments that are intended for shared, routine use and/or passage during all hours by all residents and their guests shall be noted on the face of the preliminary and final plats and/or site plans. Shared driveways and common drives shall be designed to meet the below criteria:
1.
The use of low impact development (LID) best management practices (BMPs) in shared and common driveway construction shall be required whenever site and soil conditions make LID a feasible option, as determined by the city administrator or his or her designee;
2.
Adequate ingress/egress for fire apparatus shall be provided as approved by the city administrator or his or her designee after consultation with the City of Palmetto Fire Department; and
3.
In no circumstance shall a shared or common driveway be less than nine (9) feet in width.
(c)
Alleys: Alleys ranging in size from ten (10) to eighteen (18) feet in width may be provided where they reduce the overall amount of pervious surface on the site while providing necessary access to residences or businesses. Alleys must be designed to have a minimum of two (2) access points for emergency vehicle ingress and egress.
(12)
Curbs and stormwater: The city administrator or his or her designee may waive the requirement for curbs at the recommendation of the city engineer. In general, curbs shall be installed along all roadways exceeding a six (6) percent slope. Along roadways or portions of a roadway where the slope is three (3) percent or less, and along which sufficient right-of-way area exists to support natural stormwater drainage elements, the city administrator or his or her designee may require curb breaks to allow for stormwater drainage and to reduce the need for stormwater infrastructure construction. Curb breaks shall be twelve (12) inches in width and shall be designed to connect roadway stormwater runoff with landscaped bioretention areas. In instances where curbs are not required, the commission may require the use of curbless catch basins to drain low points in roadways where stormwater might otherwise collect.
(13)
Swales. Use shallow grassed roadside swales, boulevards and sunken parking lot islands with check dams instead of curb and gutter storm drain systems to handle runoff, wherever possible.
(14)
Medians. Pervious medians created for the purpose of bioretention, stormwater management or landscape beautification may be approved by the city administrator or his or her designee. Design for pervious traffic islands and stormwater management features shall be subject to approval by the city.
(15)
Alternative plans and standards. In instances where an applicant can demonstrate that he or she can adhere to these design standards but that an alternate plan better protects the health, safety or welfare of the community, the city administrator or his or her designee may waive these standards. The city administrator or his or her designee may base its decision in part on the recommendations of the city engineer and fire marshal.

The mayor and council shall provide the final decision of the city with respect to the final plat.
Sec. C. - Final plat approval.
Approval of the final plat shall be given only after the planning and zoning board and the mayor and council have made the following determinations:
(1)
The final plat meets all requirements of these subdivision regulations.
(2)
The final engineering plans meet all requirements of these subdivision regulations.

Sec. G. - Bonds or irrevocable letter of credit.
modified
After approval of the final plat, building construction or issuance of building permits shall be permitted provided that the subdivider furnishes to the city a maintenance bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the form required by the mayor and council for the purpose of guaranteeing the materials and workmanship of the minimum improvements for a period of two (2) years as a condition for obtaining a certificate of occupancy (CO). For purposes of the maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit determination, "minimum improvements" includes all materials and work within the proposed right-of-way plus any part of the public storm sewer, sanitary sewer and water lines serving the property and/or the subdivision. This includes, but is not limited to, stormwater pipe, sanitary sewer pipe, water lines, open ditches, headwalls, stormwater management ponds, etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, where a greater bonding requirement, e.g., five (5) years for stormwater detention pond maintenance, is required elsewhere in the Code such extended bonding period shall not be reduced to the two-year-bonding period required herein. Bonding periods of greater than two (2) years required elsewhere herein shall remain for that same duration despite this two-year period set out herein. The maintenance bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be in the amount of one hundred ten (110) percent of the construction cost of the minimum improvements estimated by a professional engineer registered in Georgia and approved by the city engineer. The subdivider shall be responsible for making any needed repairs to the road or other minimum improvements as defined above within the two-year bonding period. Notification of needed repairs may be provided by the city to the subdivider at any time during the bonding period. If the subdivider does not make the necessary repairs within ninety (90) calendar days of said notification, the city's engineer shall claim funds from the bond or irrevocable letter of credit to adequately reimburse the City for its costs associated with having the repairs made by a contractor or the appropriate city department. Regardless of project size, the minimum maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If a final plat becomes void, as may happen if not recorded into the county clerk of superior court records within ninety (90) calendar days of approval by the city, the existing maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit is also void and a new maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit will be required prior to approval of the new final plat.
