ARTICLE 19. - LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING

Sec. 19-1. - Intent.
new
It is the intent of this section to require landscaping and screening to buffer the negative impacts between incompatible land uses; to minimize the adverse effects of certain outdoor activities upon their surroundings; and to improve the appearance of parking areas and street frontages within the community. It is further intended to preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities, character, privacy, and land values of property within the City of Palmetto. The requirements of this article shall be applied in addition to those requirements of Chapter 23.5 of the City of Palmetto Code of Ordinances. Where a conflict exists, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
Sec. 19-2. - Buffer zones.

1.
A buffer zone shall be required along common property lines between abutting zoning districts, as specified in table 19-2. The buffer shall be placed on the property within the less restrictive zoning district and shall be required even if the abutting property is undeveloped.
