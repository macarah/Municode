Sec. 307. - Sexually oriented adult uses.
Sec. 307.01. - Purpose.
a.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Oconee County, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development, both of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the Board of Commissioners' hearing on January 28, 2003, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the Oconee County Board of Commissioners on other occasions and on documentary evidence submitted to the Board of Commissioners, the Oconee County Board of Commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
b.
It is the finding of the Board of Commissioners of Oconee County that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
c.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The Board of Commissioners finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Oconee County, as well.
d.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the Oconee County Board of Commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
e.
The Board of Commissioners finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon Oconee County are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the Board of Commissioners has been made aware of Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the County on Jimmy Carter Boulevard which has shown that a substantial amount of activity at that bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths.
f.
The Board of Commissioners of Oconee County, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Oconee County finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The Board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this Ordinance is hereby adopted.
