Exhibit D
Budget Process
Budget Process and Procedure
The prospective budget submittal plan for the upcoming fiscal year will be distributed to the board during the fourth week of January. A budget submittal plan sets milestones and target dates for each budget event and/or task.
The budget request forms are then distributed to each elected official and department director during the second week of February. The budget forms are data collection documents. Each elected official and department director shall complete anticipated revenue and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year, taking into account past fiscal year results and future fiscal year needs and desires. A complete set of departmental forms are provided for the board of commissioners at this time and will be updated throughout the budget process.
Preliminary budget discussions with the finance director occur between elected officials/department directors during the first week of March. This meeting is in an informal setting, usually in the finance director's office, with various finance department personnel also in attendance. These are a series of scheduled meetings with elected officials/department directors during the course of the week. Attendance from each elected official and department director is mandatory. The various commissioners' attendance (maximum of two at one time) is based on a predetermined schedule. These meetings facilitate open discussion for individual departmental needs/desires for the upcoming year, allowing for direct input from commissioners and open feedback.
The elected officials and department directors meet during the second week of March in the chairman of the board of commissioner's office with the chairman of the board of commissioners, county administrative officer and finance director. All budget requests are reviewed and considered at this time. Commissioners will be notified of these meetings and one commissioner in addition to the chairperson will be given the opportunity to attend.
All budget request forms are returned to the board of commissioners via the finance department during the third week of March. This is a deadline, more so than a milestone. The budget request forms should be all inclusive, taking into account revenue and expenditures for the General Fund, Capitol Projects, SPLOST and all special revenue. The commissioner's budget notebooks are updated at this time in preparation for public hearings.
Public hearings with the board of commissioners are held during the second week of april. These hearings typically require three days to complete. This is the first opportunity for public comment on the upcoming fiscal year budget. Each elected official/department director is afforded the opportunity to discuss their specific budget request in an open public forum.
The board of commissioners performs an internal review and/or consideration of the fiscal year budget during the third and fourth weeks of April. It is during this review period, that the comprehensive budget for the upcoming fiscal year is balanced.
The final proposed fiscal year budget is submitted to the board of commissioners from the finance director during the second week of May. The budget will be balanced with revenues matching expenditures.
There are two required public hearings on the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The first public hearing is held during the third week of May. This is the first opportunity for the public to comment on the proposed fiscal year budget as a balanced document, meaning revenues and expenditures are in balance. During this meeting, the board of commissioners tentatively schedules the budget for adoption. The second public hearing is scheduled for a 6:30[p.m.] called meeting. During this public hearing, the finance director will propose the balanced budget to the board of commissioners and the public for the second time.
At the regularly scheduled board meeting in June, scheduled the first Tuesday in June, the board of commissioners is scheduled to adopt the proposed budget as the official budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1.
