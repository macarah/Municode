(Ord. No. 07-2020 , § 1, 3-12-2020)
Sec. 70-197. - General criteria.
(a)
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the City of Tybee Island wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the wastewater superintendent or his or her representative, that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor types shall be of a type and capacity approved by the wastewater superintendent.
(b)
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food services facilities inside the City of Tybee Island wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed of. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the City of Tybee Island's grease management program in the following manner:
(1)
The City of Tybee Island will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease management program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the wastewater superintendent.
(2)
Each food service facility in the vicinity of a problem area will be inspected. The facilities grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor and related equipment will be asses. Maintenance records will also be reviewed.
(3)
Following the inspection, the City of Tybee Island will send written notice to the inspected facility, containing a summary of the policy requirements and the results of the inspection. The inspection results will typically result in one of the following actions:
a.
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
b.
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the wastewater superintendent a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor equipment.
c.
Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance of the grease interceptor equipment will be required to install the necessary equipment to bring the facility into compliance.
(c)
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor.
(d)
Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils and food particles. Educational materials are available from the City of Tybee Island Water/Sewer Department regarding the minimization of these wastes.
(e)
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to the grease interceptor.
(f)
Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is an area outside of an exterior wall but upstream of the domestic sewer drain line. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the superintendent. The user bears the responsibility of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(Ord. No. 07-2020 , § 1, 3-12-2020)
Sec. 70-198. - Design criteria.
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards. Outdoor units will have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies will be subject to the written approval of the wastewater superintendent. Such approval will be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible. The user shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the City of Tybee Island. The City of Tybee Island reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharges or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the sizing formula.
(Ord. No. 07-2020 , § 1, 3-12-2020)
Sec. 70-199. - Grease interceptor maintenance.
(a)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user, at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the material is removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed is strictly forbidden.
(b)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or inline grease interceptors must be pumped completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped out more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by the wastewater superintendent.
(c)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the City of Tybee Island's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the grease interceptor. The wastewater superintendent will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. When an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(d)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed of at a facility approved of by the City of Tybee Island to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer system.
(e)
Additives. Any additive placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a regular, constant or scheduled basis shall be reported to the wastewater superintendent. Such additives shall include, but are not limited to, commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to consume, absorb or treat fats, oils and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternate technology or a substitution for maintenance requirements herein.
(f)
