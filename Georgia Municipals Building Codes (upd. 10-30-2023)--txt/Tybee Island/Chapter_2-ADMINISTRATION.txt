ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 2-1. - Conveyance of property to abutting owners.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for the conveyance by quitclaim deed of city property to abutting owners who wish to apply for such a conveyance when the conveyance is deemed to be appropriate in all respects, is for adequate consideration, and which will permit the highest and best use of the property.
(b)
Procedure.
(1)
Anyone owning real property in the city which abuts real property of the city who wishes to apply for a conveyance of a portion or all of the abutting city property shall first make application to the city by directing a written request to the clerk of council. The request shall be accompanied by a map, diagram or sketch of the property sought to be conveyed and the abutting properties and the writing shall state the reason the applicant believes that the conveyance is appropriate.
(2)
When the clerk of council receives an appropriate application, the clerk shall distribute copies thereof to the city manager and/or to all department heads of the city as directed by the city manager as well as to the mayor and council. Department heads should comment to the city manager on whether or not, in their opinion, the proposed conveyance is in the best interest of the city. The city manager shall report to the department heads all findings to the mayor and council within 45 days of receipt by the clerk of council of the applicant's written request.
(3)
At the following meeting of the mayor and council, the matter should be considered and the mayor and council should determine whether the city is or is not preliminarily interested in pursuing the matter further. In the event the mayor and council are receptive to the applicant's proposal, the expression of such interest shall not be binding on the city and the city shall not be committed at any point in the process until after it has expressly agreed to be bound to make the conveyance for a specified consideration.
(c)
Survey and appraisal; conveyance request submission; decision by mayor and council.
(1)
Once the city, through the mayor and council, has expressed an interest in the applicant's proposal, the applicant shall, within 60 days of the vote by the mayor and council, expressing such interest, obtain a survey of the affected area as well as an appraisal by a qualified real estate appraiser from a list of acceptable appraisers designated by the city manager to establish the value of the property involved in the conveyance.
(2)
The applicant shall then submit the request along with the appraisal, survey and related material to the clerk of council who shall refer the matter to the planning commission, which shall review the matter and make a recommendation to the mayor and council.
(3)
The mayor and council may either approve the conveyance, approve with contingencies, to consider alternatives, or to deny the request.
(d)
Public hearing. A public hearing shall be conducted by the mayor and council in an open council meeting concerning the applicant's request prior to any conveyance being consummated. The public hearing shall be advertised and conducted by following the procedures used by the city for conducting public hearings on zoning matters.
(e)
City negotiations; approval. The city is not required to accept the amount of the appraisal and may negotiate for a higher price or reject the proposal entirely or in parts. Once the agreed upon consideration has been paid to the city in connection with an approved conveyance and an appropriate resolution with a plat or survey attached has been adopted, the city may convey by quitclaim deed whatever interest the city might possess in the affected property.

ARTICLE III. - OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

Sec. 2-106. - Code of ethics for city officials.
(a)
Generally.
(1)
The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed.
(2)
All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. Ga. Const. art. I, § 2, ¶ 1.
(3)
The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it. Ga. Const. art. I, § 2, ¶ 2.
(4)
The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents.
(5)
Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:
a.
Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, and equality under the law; and
b.
Avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.
(b)
Purpose.
(1)
It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials and employees is adopted.
(2)
This code has the following purposes:
a.
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
b.
To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city;
c.
To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters that affect the city; and
d.
To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
(3)
The provisions of this section shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulations of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.
