Sec. 46-29. - Drug free testing policy.
(a)
Statement of purpose. It is the policy of the city that the abuse of alcohol and drugs by public employees is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public. The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable standards and procedures for drug and alcohol testing of city employees and applicants for employment for certain public health, safety and security positions within the city. The city also recognizes that individuals employed as municipal employees have certain rights to privacy. However, under applicable state and federal laws, the city's interest in protecting the health and safety of the public outweigh the individual employee's legitimate expectations of privacy. Accordingly, certain procedural safeguards, limitations, and due process guarantees are set forth in connection with the testing required by this section.
(b)
Scope of policy. Drug and alcohol abuse by city employees is prohibited. This shall include the illegal manufacture, distribution, possession or use of a controlled substance, the abuse of prescription medications, and the use of alcohol during or immediately preceding work hours or on city premises. This prohibition also includes the unauthorized use of prescription drugs or the abuse of prescribed drugs. The use or possession of prescription drugs while on work premises, or while working, which could affect or impair the ability to function in one's job shall be prohibited, unless the prescribing physician has been notified of the duties involved with the employee's position and has approved, in writing, the use of the drug while that employee is performing those duties. Use of "over the counter medication" which has a narcotic labeled as "can cause drowsiness," shall not be used by employees prior to operating a city vehicle or heavy equipment or performing other safety sensitive functions. If an employee is directly observed using alcohol, or a controlled or illegal substance while on duty, the city expressly reserves the right to immediately terminate the employee without testing as provided in this policy. The employee may appeal such actions as per section 46-35.
(c)

(8)
THC (marijuana);
(9)

(10)
All drugs specified by the state as controlled substances;
(11)
All drugs required to be tested under applicable federal laws.
(d)
Reasons for testing.
(1)
Pre-employment. As a condition of employment so as to guard against hiring people with current drug use problems.
(2)
Testing of current employees.
a.
Reasonable suspicion. The city may require a current employee to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol during working hours. The term "reasonable suspicion" means a belief that can be articulated based upon specific facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts. Circumstances, which constitute a basis for determining reasonable suspicion, include, but are not limited to:
1.
A pattern of abnormal or erratic behavior;
2.
Observed use, possession or sale of illegal or prescription drugs or alcohol, or a report of same from a reliable source;
3.
Employee involvement in or contribution to a work-related accident;
4.
Presence of physical symptoms of drug or alcohol abuse (i.e., glassy or bloodshot eyes, alcohol odor on breath, slurred speech, poor coordination and/or motor reflexes);
b.
On-the-job accident. When any employee has an accident in a city vehicle for which they are cited or listed on the police report as being "at fault" or when any employee has an accident or injury on the job that results in the employee seeking medical help under workers' compensation.
c.
Violations of criminal drug law statutes involving the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, or prescription drugs and/or violations of other drug/alcohol statutes.
d.
Follow-up program for treatment of drug or alcohol abuse.
e.

f.
Random screening. Employees may be randomly tested without reasonable suspicion when they are in a position involving public health, safety or security. Federal law under the department of transportation and the state department of transportation regulations require random and post-accident testing of all employees who possess a commercial driver's license which they utilize in the course of their job-related duties. The city manager will determine and provide a list of those employees who are subject to random drug/alcohol testing.
(e)
Pre-employment drug testing.
(1)
All applicants for employment who have been tentatively selected for a position must submit to a urine drug test before final selection.
(2)
A positive drug screen invalidates the offer made by the city to the individual seeking the position. Applicants will be notified in writing if they are rejected on the basis of a confirmed positive result. The individual will not be able to re-apply for employment with the city for one year.
(3)
Refusal by an applicant to be tested will result in the job offer being rescinded.
(f)
Employee drug testing. As described above, there are several types of situations that call for testing of employees or prospective employees, including pre-employment, reasonable suspicion testing, random testing with employees in safety sensitive positions, and follow-up under discipline or employee assistance protocols.
The city manager, or his/her designee, shall identify all positions considered safety sensitive. Positions so designated shall be positions that, if an employee in such position were in any manner impaired by controlled substances, the employee's ability to safely and/or substantially perform the duties of the position could be compromised with potential great risk of harm to the employee, other employees, or the general public.
Any employee who refuses to consent to drug and/or alcohol testing when reasonable suspicion has been identified, or any employee in a safety sensitive position who refuses such testing' upon request, will be subject to immediate discipline up to and including termination.
(1)
Reasonable suspicion drug testing.
a.
A supervisor is required to detail, in writing, on the designated personnel form, the specific facts, symptoms, or observations, which formed the basis for their determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing of an employee. This documentation shall be forwarded to the appropriate department head or designee as the city manager finds appropriate. These forms shall be considered confidential.
(2)
On-the-job accident drug testing.
a.
Any traffic accident involving a city driver in a city vehicle where the driver is "at fault" in the accident, will be required to be tested for alcohol and drugs. The determination of "at fault" should be made by the police. If an accident involves an injury or another vehicle, a police report must be obtained. Supervisors may decide to get a police report on any accident when there is a question of "at fault" status.
b.
If the employee tests positive on his/her screen, he/she will be terminated from employment and not offered a "second chance" for treatment under EAP.

(h)
Prior notice of testing policy. The city shall provide written notice of its drug-free testing policy to all employees. This shall be accomplished by providing each existing employee with a copy of the drug-free testing policy and obtaining each employee's signature attesting that they have received a copy of the drug-free testing policy. Job applicants may be informed verbally or in writing of the existence of the city's drug-free testing policy. Furthermore, any job posting which requires a drug/alcohol screening shall state such in the job posting.
(i)
Procedures to be followed for reasonable suspicion testing. If, in the opinion of the department head or his/her designee, a reasonable suspicion (a reasonable suspicion must be based on objective indications of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse; more obvious indications of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse include repeated unauthorized absences, repeated illnesses, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, lethargic behavior, rapid weight loss, behavior inappropriate or inconsistent with the workplace, or odor of alcohol arises, the following procedures shall be followed:
(1)
The supervisor shall determine if there is a reasonable suspicion an employee may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including controlled substances and prescriptions, or both.
(2)
When possible, a supervisor should have a second supervisor or member of the management team verify suspicion through observance of the employee's behavior in the workplace. This second verification is required for CDL drivers.
(3)
The employee shall be escorted by the supervisor to this/her office or to an area where confidentiality can be maintained. The other "observing" supervisor or management team member, if any, who can maintain confidentiality, should be witness to the conversation.
(4)
The supervisor must be clear with the employee about the viewed behavior. The employee should be questioned as to whether he/she may be ill or taking medications. The supervisor should advise the employee of any odor of alcohol. The supervisor should use caution in questioning the employee about alcohol or drug use. The supervisor must keep statements and questions geared to job performance and/or work-related behavior. The reasonable suspicion observation form for supervisors included in this policy must be used when testing an employee "for cause." This form must be signed by the two supervisors, if two participated, and the supervisor if only one, and returned to the city's HR administrator or designee within 24 hours of the drug test.
(5)
The department head should be contacted of the decision to test the employee. The HR administrator or designee should also be notified so the lab can be informed of the employee to be tested.
(6)
The supervisor should escort the employee to the city's designated lab. The employee will be asked to sign a consent form prior to testing.
(7)
After the drug test is completed, the supervisor should make the necessary arrangements to have the employee taken home. If the employee refuses assistance, or at any time during the process of this test decides to leave the worksite on their own, the police should be called to warn them of the employee's condition.
(8)
The employee shall be placed on leave with pay until results from the drug/alcohol test are verified. If the test is negative, the employee is to immediately return to work. If positive, the employee is referred to the HR administrator or designee to be evaluated. The employee is immediately suspended without pay for five working days and will not [be] allowed to return to work until he/she has a negative drug/alcohol screen.
(9)
Every effort will be made to uphold the principle of allowing the employee to get treatment for an alcohol or drug problem. If the employee has had previous treatment, has extensive problems related to job performance, or shows a lack of interest or motivation in getting help for his/her problem, a decision may be made by his/her department head for termination. After testing positive, an employee must have a negative screen to return to work after the five-day suspension. If the recommendation is to retain the employee, they will be required to follow through with a program of treatment, and a continuing care contract. Once the employee returns to work, he/she is subject to immediate termination not only for further substance abuse, but also for failure to follow through with the terms of his/her contract.
(10)
Employees who are required to drive as a part of their work may be subject to suspension or loss of driving privilege as a result of a drug test or incident. This disqualification from driving may result in demotion to a non-driving position or termination form employment.
(j)
Random testing for employees in positions defined by the city manager to be "safety sensitive." The city manager, or his/her designee, shall identify all positions considered safety sensitive. Positions so designated shall be positions that, if an employee in such position were in any manner impaired by controlled substances, the employee's ability to safely and/or substantially perform the duties of the position could be compromised with potential great risk of harm to the employee, other employee, or the general public.

However, participation in the EAP program will not protect an employee from disciplinary action or even termination after he has been requested or required to submit to a drug/alcohol test. In these cases, the EAP process may be used in conjunction with discipline, but not as a substitute for discipline. All employees who are referred to the EAP as a mandatory participant and who refuse to cooperate in counseling and rehabilitation for drug or alcohol use, or who are found to have used drugs or alcohol during the course of their treatment and rehabilitation, shall be subject to immediate termination. All participants in the EAP drug or alcohol programs are subject to random testing during the course of their treatment and rehabilitation.
(q)
Convicted employees' participation in rehabilitation. The city will notify any granting agency as defined in the Drug Free Workplace Act, within ten days after receiving notice of a conviction from an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction and will impose a sanction on or require the satisfactory participation in a drug abuse assistance rehabilitation program by any such convicted employee as required by 41 USC 703 within 30 days of notice of such conviction.
(r)

Informal disciplinary hearing. Before an employee other than a department head is suspended without pay, demoted, or dismissed from employment, he shall be entitled to an informal hearing before the department head. At least 12 hours prior to such a hearing, the employee will be furnished with a written notice stating the disciplinary action contemplated, and the reasons for such actions. This notice should advise the employee that he will have an opportunity to respond in writing and/or orally before the department head at the time of the hearing so as to effectively rebut the reasons for disciplinary action contemplated.

No appeal is permissible from the city manager's decision by a department head.
(d)
Suspension with pay prior to hearing. In any extraordinary situation where an employee is unfit to perform his work under circumstances where retention of the employee pending a hearing might result in damage to the property or injury to the employee or other persons or the employee is physically unable to perform his duties, or retention might be detrimental to the interest of the city government or pending an investigation of disciplinary issues, an employee may be suspended temporarily with pay prior to a hearing.

The provisions of subsection (c) of this section and this subsection shall not apply to probationary employees.
(Code 1983, § 2-4-10; Ord. No. 25-2010, 2-24-2011)
Sec. 46-34. - Sexual harassment.
(a)
Goal. The city has a goal of establishing a workplace free from sexual harassment. Every employee of the city has a duty to protect and safeguard the rights and opportunities of every other employee to seek, obtain, and hold employment without subjugation to sexual harassment of any kind in the workplace. Ensuring a workplace environment free of sexual harassment is a goal that all employees are to share and to work together toward achieving. All employees are responsible for the implementation of and compliance with this goal.
(b)
Definition.
(1)
Sexual harassment is defined as:
a.
Making unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when submission to, or rejection of such conduct is made, explicitly or implicitly, and basis for any decision affecting employee status (e.g., pay, promotion, assignment, termination, etc.); or
b.
Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment through:
1.
Verbal conduct such as sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature or sexual propositions;
2.
Nonverbal conduct such as sexual suggestive objects or pictures, graphic commentaries, leering, whistling, or obscene gestures; or
3.
Physical conduct such as unwanted physical contact of any nature including touching, pinching or brushing the body.
(2)
Such conduct is prohibited in the workplace.
(3)
The term "harassment" generally suggests a pattern of conduct; however, an isolated instance of conduct as described above could constitute harassment depending on the circumstances of the particular incident.
(c)
Implementation.
(1)
The city requests and encourages any employee who believes that he has been subjected to any such prohibited conduct described above by any other employee to report the incident to his immediate supervisor.
(2)
If the alleged conduct is that of the immediate supervisor, the employee is encouraged to report such incident directly to the department head.
(3)
If the alleged conduct is that of the department head the employee is encouraged to report such incident to the city manager.
(4)
The immediate supervisor, department head, or city manager, as applicable, shall conduct a prompt, confidential investigation of all alleged incidents of prohibited conduct. Any employee who is found to have either engaged in, or condoned prohibited conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, as appropriate, up to and including termination.
(d)
Nonretaliation. This goal also prohibits retaliation against employees who bring harassment charges or assist in investigating charges. Any employee bringing a sexual harassment complaint or assisting in the investigation of such a complaint will not be adversely affected in terms and conditions of employment, nor discriminated against or discharged because of the complaint.
(e)
Appeals. Decisions made under this section may be appealed in the same manner as any other personnel decision, pursuant to section 46-35.
(Code 1983, § 2-4-10.2)
Sec. 46-35. - Appeal of disciplinary action.
After any suspension without pay, demotion, or dismissal from city employment, the affected employee shall have the right to appeal within five days after the effective date of the disciplinary action. The employee should notify the city manager in writing of his desire to have a hearing. The city manager shall promptly notify the employee of the time of the hearing in writing, the reasons for the disciplinary action taken, the names and the nature of the testimony of the witnesses against him, and that the employee will have an opportunity to present evidence on the issues.
(Code 1983, § 2-4-11)
Sec. 46-36. - Grievances.
(a)
In general. The effective accomplishment of the work of the city requires prompt consideration and equitable adjustment of employee grievances. It is the desire of the city to adjust the causes of grievances informally, and the city manager, department heads and employees are expected to make every effort to resolve problems as they arise.
(b)
Procedure follows lines of authority. In the city, procedures follow the established lines of authority. An employee first discusses the problem with the appropriate department head within 30 calendar days from the date the grievant first becomes aware of his grievance.
(c)
Grievance presented to city manager. If satisfaction is not achieved by the above procedure within ten working days, the grievance must then be presented by the grievant to the city manager. Grievance problems carried to the city manager must be submitted in writing.
(d)
Meeting to discuss grievance. The city manager shall convene a meeting within ten days to consider the grievance. The employee and the department head shall have the right to appear and be heard. The city manager shall take appropriate action which may include a recommendation to change the personnel rules and regulations, a finding that the grievance is unjustified or a finding that the situation is not subject to the grievance procedure or not a grievable matter or any other appropriate recommendation or determination.
(e)
Effect of using grievance procedure. No employee shall be disciplined or discriminated against in any way for proper use of the grievance procedure.
(Code 1983, § 2-4-12; Ord. No. 25-2010, 2-24-2011)
Sec. 46-37. - Annual leave.
Annual leave is based on years of service to the city and is computed as follows:
(1)
Permanent appointments—Full-time employees. Employees who have a permanent appointment and work full-time, in their first year of service earn one-half of a day per month of annual leave, or six work days in the first year. Accumulation begins as soon as employment begins, but annual leave may not be taken until after three months of continuous employment with the city. Employees with one or more years of continuous service earn leave at the rate of one day per month, or 12 work days per year. Employees with ten or more years of continuous service earn leave at the rate of 1½ days per month, or 18 work days per year.
(2)
Service requirement. Vacation leave is earned during any month in which the employee is at work at least one-half the work days within that month.
(3)
Vacation leave schedule.
a.
Vacation leave shall be scheduled by the department heads, and approved by the city manager, with particular attention to seniority of employees, departmental operating requirements, and insofar as possible, the requests of the employees.
b.
Employees shall submit in writing a request for vacation leave to their department head prior to the desired vacation date.
c.
Vacation leave may not be taken in increments of less than one-half day.
d.
Vacation leave may be accrued to a maximum of 30 days.
(4)
Pay in lieu of vacation leave. Any employee eligible for vacation time may elect to be paid for not more than 40 hours of accrued vacation leave once each year by notifying the appropriate department head on the form provided for this purpose, provided the employee has taken off a minimum 40 hours' vacation prior to this request, during the same calendar year, and provided that permission is approved by both the department head and the city manager.
(5)
Employee donation of vacation leave. An employee may elect to donate some portion of his/her accrued vacation leave to another employee in need under the following conditions:
a.
Such vacation leave must be transferred, on an hourly basis as opposed to a cost basis. The donee may only use the donated time for actual sick leave.
b.
The recipient must be in need of additional leave time for personal illness or illness of a family member and must be at the point of taking leave without pay.
c.
Vacation leave, once donated, shall not be given back to the donor except where the conditions of subsection b. above are met.
d.
In no case shall the donor transfer vacation leave to another employee for the single purpose of avoiding losing vacation leave.
e.
The sale or trade of vacation leave for purposes which would circumvent the spirit of this procedure is prohibited.
f.
Requests to donate vacation leave should be made in writing to the department head and the city manager.
(6)
Possible requirement of vacation leave. The city recognizes the benefit of employees having time off for leisure and recreation. Department heads and/or the city manager may therefore require employees to utilize a maximum of 40 hours' vacation leave each calendar year as time off from work.
(7)
Other employees.
a.
Employees who have a permanent appointment and work part-time, earn annual leave on a prorated basis, as determined by the city manager, computed on the basis of the ratio of hours worked during the prior three-month period relative to the work defined for full-time employment.
b.
Employees who have a temporary appointment and work full-time, other than seasonal employees, earn annual leave on the same basis as employees who have permanent appointments.
c.
Employees who have a temporary appointment and work part-time; and seasonal employees working either full-time or part-time; and employees who have an emergency appointment, do not earn annual leave.
(Code 1983, § 2-4-13(a); Ord. of 7-14-2005, § (a))
Sec. 46-38. - Sick leave.
Sick leave is given to employees only for sound and valid reasons. It is so designed to meet necessary, emergency conditions of illness. Each department head has the authority to approve or disapprove sick leave applications. Sick leave shall not be abused; it is to be used as insurance for salary continuation in the event an employee becomes ill and is unable to work.
(1)
Eligibility. An employee may be eligible for sick leave for the following reasons:
a.
Personal illness;
b.
Quarantine of an employee by physician;
c.
Illness in the immediate family requiring the employee to remain at home;
d.
Death of a member of employee's immediate family. Immediate family shall mean and include spouse, child, step-child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, or the spouse of any of them. These relationships shall include those arising from adoptions, persons who are married by common law marriage or who are living together without the benefit of matrimony are also considered related under the intention of this rule;
e.
Appointments with physicians for self or dependents.
All full-time employees, and career employees serving temporarily in substitute or acting capacities, are eligible to accrue sick leave as described in subsection (2) below. Temporary, seasonal, and part-time employees are not eligible for sick leave except as described below.
(2)
Sick leave for on-the-job injury. An employee who sustains an injury on the job must, at the time of the injury or as soon as possible thereafter, notify the supervisor on the forms provided. The appropriate department head shall review the case and make recommendations to the city manager or designate for appropriate compensation. If the injury necessitates the employee's absence from work, the employee shall receive only that compensation provided under workman's compensation.
(3)
Accrual of sick leave.
a.
Employees who have a permanent appointment and work full-time, shall accrue sick leave at the rate of one day per month, or 12 days per year.
b.
Accumulation begins as soon as employment begins, but sick leave may not be taken until after three months of continuous employment with the city.
c.
Sick leave is accrued during any month in which the employee is at work at least one-half the work days within that month.
(4)
Reporting of sick leave. An employee who is absent from work because of illness is responsible for reporting to the appropriate supervisor or department head at the designated reporting time on the day of absence, and will be expected to keep his supervisor or department head informed of his progress on a regular basis; such leave will be charged against sick leave. Where a relief employee is required in a department which must provide 24 hours' sustained service, the employee, if possible, should report his absence two hours before the designated reporting time. In the event of failure of compliance with this provision, the employee will be charged on the payroll with leave without pay. A physician's certificate may be required for sick leave absences of three or more days.
(5)
Use of sick leave. Sick leave is not to be considered a right which an employee may use at his discretion, but a privilege not to be abused. Abuse or misuse of sick leave is a cause for disciplinary action since falsification of any information required by the city and/or "absences without leave" are both causes for reprimand, suspension, and dismissal. Department heads who feel an employee is abusing the sick leave privilege may also require the employee to furnish a doctor's certificate for each period of absence regardless of the provision of subsection (4) above.
(6)
Accumulated sick leave. An employee, upon separation from the city service, shall not receive payment for accumulated sick leave.
(7)
Extended sick leave. In addition to sick leave accrued, additional sick leave may be advanced up to a maximum of 12 days with the approval of the city manager. Extended sick leave will be granted only due to extraordinary circumstances, such as for a serious injury or disease, (heart attack, cancer treatment, not for a cold, headache, or flu). Sick leave may not be advanced during a leave without pay status. Leave records will show a negative balance until normal accruals reduce the balance to zero.
(8)
Sick leave wellness incentive. Employees who successfully undertake wellness programs are eligible for monetary incentives. Qualified wellness programs include weight reduction programs, stop smoking programs, preventive physical examinations, and similar wellness-promotion activities. Eligible employees may apply for monetary incentives by providing the city manager receipts of expenditures made and proof of results achieved. Incentives payments shall be at the rate of 300 percent of the value of sick leave hours surrendered by the employee to the city, at the discretion of the city manager.
(9)
Other employees.
a.
Employees who have a permanent appointment and work part-time accrue sick leave on a prorated basis, as determined by the city manager, computed on the basis of the ratio of hours worked during the prior three-month period relative to the work defined for full-time employment.
b.
Employees who have a temporary appointment and work full-time, other than seasonal employees, accrue sick leave on the same basis as employees who have permanent appointments.
c.
Employees who have a temporary appointment and work part-time; and seasonal employees working either full-time or part-time; and employees who have an emergency appointment, do not accrue sick leave.
(10)
Any employee may accumulate at most a maximum of 65 days (520 hours) of sick leave. No additional sick leave will be credited until sick leave time is used and an employee's accrued sick leave falls below 520 hours. Employees who have accrued more than 520 hours prior to the effective date hereof (January 12, 2012) shall retain those hours, but no additional sick leave will be credited until accumulated sick leave is used and the accrued hours fall below 520 hours at which time credit will recommence subject to a 520 hour maximum.
(11)
An employee may be compensated for up to 65 days of sick leave at the rate of $25.00 per day upon retirement or death. In the event the payment is owed as a result of the death of the employee, the payment will be made to the beneficiary designated by the employee for this purpose and/or to the representative(s) of the employee's estate if no beneficiary is designated.

(Code 1983, § 2-4-13(e); Ord. of 7-14-2005, § (e))
Sec. 46-42. - Leave without pay.
(a)
Generally.

Non-career employees are not eligible for grants of leave without pay. Leave without pay shall not exceed one year.
(b)
Valid reasons. Valid reasons shall include, but not be confined to, the following: Prolonged illness or disability of the employee or a member of the employee's household, educational or training enrichment, pregnancy and childbirth, and military service.
(c)
Procedure for requesting leave without pay. Application for leave without pay shall be submitted in writing in advance, showing the employee's reason for requesting such leave and shall contain a statement that he intends to return to the city service upon expiration of such leave and that he agrees to the terms and conditions as outlined in these policies. In emergency situations, when an employee does not have accrued leave and is unable to return to work as scheduled as a result of illness or emergency reasons, his department may recommend approval of the granting of leave without pay without prior application by the employee, or the personnel officer may investigate and make such recommendations in the absence of the department head.
(d)
Temporary filling of position of employee on leave without pay. During the employee's approved leave of absence, his position may be filled by the temporary appointment of a substitute. At the expiration of leave without pay, the employee (subject to subsection (e) below) shall be reinstated in his former position, and the substitute employee returned to his former position without loss of status or benefits.

(3)
Notice required; initial certification. Employees must give 30 days' notice for all requests for leaves of absences for any planned medical treatment. If the employee fails to give 30 days' notice, when requested, for foreseeable leave, with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the city manager may deny the taking of FMLA leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the city manager of the need for FMLA leave.

Intermittent leave or a reduced schedule of work may be taken whenever medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work. Employees needing intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as to not disrupt the department's operation. Intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule will not be approved for birth of a child, placement for adoption or foster care of a child.

a.
The restoration of the employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the city;
b.
The city manager gives written notice to the employee of his status as a "key" employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take FMLA leave, and informs the employee of the potential consequences with respect to reinstatements and maintenance of health benefits if the city determines that substantial and grievous economic injury to the city's operations will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave;

Occasionally eligible employees may be called upon to work overtime, and such employees are to be paid at a rate of 1½ hours for each hour worked, in excess of 40 hours per week or in excess of their established work period, as applicable, or may receive compensatory time off. The following particulars apply:
(1)
Only employees eligible for overtime pay are eligible for compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay.
(2)
Employees not eligible for overtime pay are those employees defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as "Non-Covered Employees." Included within the definition of noncovered employees are executive, administrative and professional employees, and other salaried employees.
(3)
Overtime work must be approved and authorized by the city manager, prior to performance of the work, except in emergency conditions when overtime may be approved by the appropriate department heads.

Noncovered employees, including executive, administrative and professional employees, and salaried employees are not eligible for overtime compensation nor compensatory time off. It is recognized that the positions of these employees often require them to work beyond the regular scheduled hours of duty, and some flexibility shall be granted them in adjusting their work schedules to meet varying workloads. These employees are granted the privilege of adjusting their work schedules to work lesser hours when their workloads permit. There shall be no accumulation of administrative leave of any nature beyond these employees' privilege of adjusting their work schedules and upon departure from employment with the city, these employees will not be paid for any claimed administrative leave for supposed overtime work.
(7)
If compensation is paid to an eligible employee for accrued compensatory time off, the compensation will be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee by the time the employee receives such payment. An eligible employee who has accrued compensatory time off upon termination of employment will be paid for the unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation not less than:
a.
The average regular rate received by the employee during the last three years of the employee's employment; or

The final regular rate received by the employee, whichever is higher.
The official time and attendance records maintained by the city's personnel office will be the controlling records for any compensatory time purpose.
