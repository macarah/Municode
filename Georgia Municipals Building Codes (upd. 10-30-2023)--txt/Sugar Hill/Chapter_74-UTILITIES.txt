(Ord. of 7-14-2008(3); Ord. of 1-14-2013(1))
Sec. 74-54. - Gas rates.
(a)
All customers shall be charged a base rate of $17.00 per month and commercial customers $35.00 per month regardless of the amount of natural gas consumed by the customer plus any applicable state and local taxes. This base charge recovers the cost of staffing to provide services such as rendering a bill, explanation of bill and other operating expenses, meter reading, customer service, and other costs associated with delivering natural gas to the customer.
(b)
The rate to be charged to the customer per MCF shall be calculated by averaging the amount per MCF shown on the billing rate notice from the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia to the city for the preceding month with the amount per MCF shown on the billing rate notice from the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia to the city for the current month and adding $1.00 per MCF to that average rate. Example (Residential Shown):
(1)
Rate for preceding month from billing rate notice: $8.00 per MCF,
(2)
Rate for current month from billing rate notice: $12.00 per MCF;
(3)
Rate for current month for customer: $8.00 + $12.00 ÷ 2 = $10.00 per MCF + $1.00 per MCF = $11.00 per MCF plus base rate of $17.00 and any applicable state and local taxes.
(c)
Each year the city council shall set as part of the city's annual budget an anticipated revenue figure for its gas system. This anticipated revenue figure shall be sufficient to cover that years anticipated expenses for the gas system and transfers to the general fund. Once revenue from the gas system has reached the anticipated revenue figure, the rate to calculate the monthly gas bill shall be altered for the remainder of that calendar year. The formula shall be altered in the following manner: reduce the $1.00 per MCF charge to $0.50 per MCF. Example:
(1)
Anticipated revenue: $1,000,000.00;
(2)
Revenue reached as of October 1: $1,000,000.00 and actual expenditures have not exceeded the budgeted amount;
(3)
New gas formula for the months of November and December:
Preceding month: $8.00 per MCF
Current month: $12.00 per MCF
Rate of current month: $8.00 + $12.00 ÷ 2= $10.00 per MCF + $0.50 per MCF = $10.50 per MCF plus base rate and any applicable state and local taxes.
(d)
The rate charged to customers residing inside the municipal boundaries of the city and to customers residing outside of the municipal boundaries of the city shall be the same. This section shall not change or have any effect on any other administrative or operational fees presently charged by the city in connection with natural gas consumption including, but not limited to, cut off fees, reconnection fees, deposits or other such charges.

Sec. 74-59. - Identity theft prevention program.
(a)
Findings. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") requires every utility, including public gas systems, to implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program ("ITPP"). The FTC requirement and regulation is necessary because of Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ("FACT Act"). The FTC has set forth the ITPP requirement in 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. Identify theft is defined as a fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority. The City of Sugar Hill ("city") adopts the program set forth in this section to comply with FTC rules and regulations. In drafting its ITPP, the city has considered: (1) the methods it provides to open its accounts; (2) the methods it provides to access its accounts; and (3) its previous experiences with identity theft. Based on these considerations, the governing authority of the city hereby determines that the city is a low to moderate risk entity and as a result develops and implements the streamlined ITPP set forth in this section. Further, the city determines that the only covered accounts offered by the city are those under its utilities (gas, stormwater, etc.).
(b)
Red flags. The FTC regulations identify numerous red flags that must be considered in adopting an ITPP. The FTC has defined a red flag as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.

(a)
Area computation. Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current On-Site Sewage Management System Manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health.
(b)
Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream, or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent. Where individual water supplies are used, absorption fields shall not be less than 50 feet from a property line. No part of the on-site sewage management system other than sealed pipe with water tight joint shall be covered by buildings, pavements, or used for parking automobiles or for vehicular traffic. There shall be available sufficient unobstructed land area, available by gravity flow, meeting all requirements for the installation of an on-site sewage management system to provide for the complete replacement of the absorption field.

Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade and trenches shall not be less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced not less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall be 36 inches wide. The minimum length for any on site sewage management system absorption field shall be 200 feet.
(d)
Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods:
(1)
Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of 6 inches, but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. The sewer from the septic tank or dosing tank shall enter the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be use, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches.
(2)
Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines.
(3)
Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the lines so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth.
(Code 1988, § 25-87)
Sec. 74-88. - Privies; minimum design and construction.
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual.
(Code 1988, § 25-88)
Sec. 74-89. - Alternative and experimental on-site management systems and site modifications.
(a)
Generally. The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in a suitable soil are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modification for area with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health.
(1)
Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required.
(2)
Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy.
(b)
Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific-factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for a conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system.
(c)
Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval, detailed plans showing the type and extent of modification. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.
(Code 1988, § 25-89)
Sec. 74-90. - Percolation tests and test borings.
(a)
Percolation tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such test shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevation during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems.
(b)
Location and number. Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area. The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designation, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map.
(c)
Test boring for rock, shale, hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map.
(d)
Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 74-151. - Findings.
The City of Sugar Hill mayor and city council make the following findings of fact:
(a)
The City of Sugar Hill, Georgia (hereinafter "the city" or "Sugar Hill") is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city.
(b)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Sugar Hill hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(c)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Sugar Hill is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal.
(d)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city.
(e)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(f)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(g)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by Gwinnett County thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(h)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area waterbodies.
(i)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase I Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(j)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase I Stormwater Permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities.
(k)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(l)
The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(m)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(n)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(o)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways.
(p)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof.
(q)
A stormwater management program (hereinafter "SWMP") provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms.
(r)
The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(s)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(t)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property.
(u)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

(a)
Billing.
(1)
Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue on January 1, 2009, and shall be billed thereafter. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
(2)
The city council appoints the Gwinnett County Tax Commissioner ("tax commissioner") as its agent and representative for the billing and collection of stormwater user fee charges. The city council authorizes the tax commissioner to bill and collect the Sugar Hill Stormwater User Fee Charge as part of the property/ad valorem tax bill. The city council further authorizes the tax commissioner to charge and collect penalties and interest as set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
In the event the tax commissioner is unable or unwilling to serve as the city's agent or is unable or unwilling to bill or collect taxes or stormwater user fee charges on behalf of the city, the city council authorizes the city manager to bill and collect the stormwater user fee charge. The city manager shall be authorized to bill and collect the stormwater user fee charge as an additional line item on the city's gas utility or through a separate one time yearly statement to be billed on or before October 1 of each year with a due date on or before November 15 of each year. The city manager may use his discretion in determining the most efficient and economical manner of collection.
(3)
If a bill for a stormwater user fee charge for a particular parcel is generated, failure of the customer to receive the bill shall not be justification for nonpayment.
(4)
Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of the property, as identified from the public land records of Gwinnett County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property and any interest and/or penalties that have accrued.
(5)
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the Sugar Hill Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any penalty charges during the back billed period.
(b)
Delinquencies and collection.
(1)
A penalty or late charge in the amount of five percent of the amount due and unpaid on the due date shall be assessed against the customer.
(2)
In addition to the penalty stated above, interest in the amount of one percent per calendar month (12 percent annually) shall accrue on all unpaid amounts beginning on November 16 of the year in which the payment is due.
(3)
The city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorneys' fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(4)
Unpaid stormwater user fee charges shall be collected in any manner permissible by Georgia law, including but not limited to: utilizing the services of a collection agency, by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account, or by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a Writ of Fieri Facias (FiFa) issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property.
(c)
Adjustments.
(1)
The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. If the stormwater utility manager fails to render a decision within 30 days, the adjustment request shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the city manager as set forth in this article. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill.

(c)
The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Gwinnett County by writ of certiorari.
