ARTICLE VIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 18-336. - Findings and Purpose.
(a)
Findings. The mayor and council of the city finds that adult entertainment establishments, if unregulated, may lead to an increase in prostitution, venereal and other sexually-transmitted disease, drug and alcohol offenses and other criminal activity; and the law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment establishments are limited and are conserved by regulating the method of operation and location of adult entertainment establishments; and based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; City of Smyrna, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Adams County, Colorado; Manatee County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Paul, Minneosta; Las Vegas, Nevada; Ellicottville, New York; Islip, New York; New York City, New York; Times Square, New York; New Hanover County, North Carolina; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Cleburne, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue Washington; Des Moines, Washington; Seattle, Washington; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin, which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such other bodies, and the studies produced by such bodies, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country; it is the finding of the mayor and council that based on the above, public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale of and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment", "adult entertainment", or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug use and trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the location of such establishments in particular areas; it is also the finding of the mayor and council that based on the above, there is an increase in the commercial exploitation of human sexuality by owners of such establishments where alcoholic beverages are served or offered for sale for consumption on the premises. Such exploitation takes the form of employing or permitting persons to perform or exhibit nude or semi-nude bodies to other persons as an inducement to such other persons to purchase alcoholic beverages. Such commercial exploitation of such nude or semi-nude acts is adverse to the public's interest in the quality of life, tone of commerce and total community environment in the city. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity and semi-nudity. The mayor and council have reviewed or caused to be reviewed certain decisions of the appellate courts, including but not limited to Paramount Pictures Corporation v. Busbee, et al., 252 Ga. 250 (1982); Harris v. Entertainment Systems, Inc., 259 Ga. 701 (1989); Yarbrough v. City of Carrollton, 262 Ga. 444 (1992); Gravely v. Bacon, 263 Ga. 203 (1993); World Famous Dudley's Food & Spirits, Inc. v. City of College Park, 265 Ga. 618 (1995); Parker v. Whitfield Co., 265 Ga. 829 (1995); Goldrush II v. City of Marietta, 267 Ga. 683 (1997); Quetgles v. City of Columbus, 268 Ga.619 (1997); Vincent, Inc. v. Broward County, Florida, 200 F.3d 1325 (2000); Wise Enterprises, Inc. v. Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, 217 F.3d 1360 (2000); Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. City of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306 (2000); University Books and Videos, Inc. v. Miami-Dade County, Florida, 132 F.Supp.2d 1008 (2001); and Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. v. Fulton County, Georgia, 242 F.3d 976 (2001). The public health, safety, welfare and convenience require that the method of operation and location of adult entertainment establishments be regulated in order to reduce the potential for harm, and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community; and the location of an adult entertainment establishment and like or associated businesses in certain areas or in close proximity of the same tend to attract an undesirable quantity and quality of transients, adversely affecting property values, cause an increase in crime, reduces property values, and encourage residents and businesses therein to move elsewhere.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
