Estimate of gross receipts. If any licensee fails to make a return, the city clerk shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the city clerk. Upon the basis of this estimate, the city clerk shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city, adding to the sum thus determined a penalty equal to fifteen (15) percent thereof. One (1) or more determinations may be made for one (1) or for more than one (1) period.
(b)
Manner of computation; offsets; interest. In making a determination, the city clerk may offset overpayments for a period or periods, against penalties and the interest on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
(c)
Interest on amount found due. The amount of the determination, exclusive of penalties, shall bear interest at the rate set forth in O.C.G.A. § 48-2-40, from the twentieth day of the month following the monthly period, for which the amount or portion thereof should have been returned, until the date of payment.
(d)
Payment for fraud or intent to evade. If the failure of any person to file a return is due to fraud or an intent to evade this article or rules and regulations, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount required to be paid by the person, exclusive of penalties, shall be added thereto in addition to the fifteen (15) percent penalty provided in section 3-111.
(e)
Giving of notice; manner of service. Promptly after making the determination, the city clerk shall give the person written notice to be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.

(b)
Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any licensee liable for any amount under this article sells out such business or quits the business, such licensee's successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the city clerk showing that such licensee has paid the tax, or a certificate stating that no amount is due.
(c)
Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the necessary amount from the purchase price as heretofore required, such purchaser becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the city clerk shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at the purchaser's address as it appears on the records of the city of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells the business or at the time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever event occurs the later.
(d)
Tax credit, penalty or interest paid more than once, or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be offset as provided in section 3-109. If the licensee determines that such licensee has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the city clerk, such licensee will have three (3) years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the city, the excess amount paid to the city may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid, or such licensee's administrators or executors.
