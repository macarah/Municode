ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 17-1. - Purpose and intent.
This chapter shall be known as the "Subdivision Ordinance" and serves the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the City of College Park by setting standards for the form and content of preliminary and final plats or plats; by setting standards to regulate the division of land; and by establishing procedures for the review of subdivision plats by the planning commission and mayor and council. This chapter further serves the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage economically sound and stable development of the city;
(2)
To assure the provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new land developments;
(3)
To assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, to new land developments;
(4)
To assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and
(5)
To assure, in general, the wise development of new areas, in harmony with the master plan of the city.
(Ord. No. 2007-20, § 1, 4-3-07)
Sec. 17-2. - Definitions.
In addition to the definitions below, this chapter shall include all the definitions appearing in the city zoning ordinance [Appendix A], unless such definitions otherwise conflict with the definitions below:
(1)
Alley: A secondary access road, typically to the rear of a building site.
(2)
Arterial street: Arterial streets provide the principal network for traffic flow within the community. They connect areas of major activity within the urban area and function primarily as carriers of cross-town traffic. Arterial streets should be designed as four-lane facilities with maximum operating speeds as referenced in the thoroughfare plan. Maximum capacity would be approximately thirty thousand (30,000) vehicles per day. Arterial streets should have limited access to adjacent land uses with driveways that do not require a vehicle to back into the street.
(3)
Block: A parcel of land entirely surrounded by public streets and other rights-of-way, other than alleys, or land which is designated as a block on any recorded subdivision map. In cases where the plotting is incomplete or disconnected, the subdivider may determine the outline of the block.
(4)
Condominium: An estate in real property consisting of an undivided interest in common in a portion of a parcel in real property together with a separate interest in space in a residential, industrial or commercial building on such real property, such as an apartments office or store. A condominium may include, in addition, a separate interest in other portions of such real property.
(5)
Design: Includes, but is not limited to, street alignments, grades and widths; the alignment and widths of easements and rights-of-way for drainage, sanitary sewers, water, utilities and other facilities for public use or benefit; the size, configuration, and location of park, open space, and recreation sites; and the lot area, width, depth, shape and pattern as may be required or otherwise provided for in this chapter, the City Code, any site plans, zoning plat or planned development plans, and the comprehensive plan and any of its elements.

Sec. 17-80. - Purpose.
(a)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure;
(b)
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land;
(c)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat;
(d)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development;
(e)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development;
(f)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community;
(g)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions;
(h)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood;
(i)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries;
(j)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles;
(k)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space; and
(l)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
