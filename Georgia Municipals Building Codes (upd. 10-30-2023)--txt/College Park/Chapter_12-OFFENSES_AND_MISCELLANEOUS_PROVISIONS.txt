It is the finding of the Mayor and council that it is in the best interest of justice to protect the basic rights recognized by the federal and state Constitutions by creating an ordinance that will prevent any person from intentionally preventing, interrupting or disrupting a public meeting, assembly, gathering or procession. The mayor and council further find that it is a compelling state and city interest to maintain the peace and order within the city limits.
Accordingly, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to narrowly enact an ordinance to protect the free association and speech of individuals within the city limits. It is also in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to protect these rights so that they may be exercised in an orderly fashion. In order to protect the right of association and free speech, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to narrowly restrict and regulate specific types of conduct and behavior to prevent disorder and to ensure that these rights are freely exercised in a peaceful manner.
Sections 12-12.1 and 12-12.2 are not intended as a facto prohibition of any constitutional rights such as the right of association and the right of free speech at a public meeting or assembly. In fact, these sections are intended to protect these fundamental rights.

ARTICLE IV. - CURFEW FOR MINORS

Sec. 12-60. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Curfew for Minors Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97)
Sec. 12-61. - Findings; purpose.
The mayor and council after having received and studied reports compiled by the police department are alarmed and concerned for the safety and well-being of juveniles within the city, as well as the high number of incidents of thefts, including, but not limited to burglary and motor vehicle thefts being perpetrated by juveniles within the city. With the interstate highways, rapid transit system, and Hartsfield International Airport bringing thousands of nonresident transient people into and through the city at all hours of the day and night, juveniles are found to be at a high risk. The national epidemic of drugs and crimes of violence are of such nature that all reasonable and constitutional efforts must be employed to insulate and protect our youthful citizens from the influence and dangers associated with such activities. It is the intent of this article to make the parents the primary agents of enforcement, and, in addition to promote family life by encouraging children to be at home.
Prevailing community standards of family responsibility, public good, safety and welfare have determined that there is a proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors. This standard takes into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for exposure of minors to potential risks incident to immaturity, along with exceptions and provisions so as to not prohibit or unnecessary infringe upon reasonable legitimate purposes of any person.
Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effect and, as parental control increases, the likelihood of juvenile delinquency and danger to minors decreases. The cooperative enforcement of this curfew by the city, the parents, and the minor will provide for a more safe and healthy community environment and will achieve the purposes hereinbefore stated.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97)
Sec. 12-62. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article:
(1)
City is the City of College Park, Fulton and Clayton Counties, Georgia.
(2)
Minor is any person under the age of seventeen (17), or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person sixteen (16) or less years of age.
(3)
Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor (i) as a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco parentis or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court.
(4)
Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, alone or with others, in such manner that any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in section 12-64 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended for use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain."

Sec. 12-64. - Exception.
(a)
In the following exceptional cases a minor on a College Park street during the nocturnal hours for which section 12-63 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their fellow citizens) shall not, however, be considered in violation of the curfew ordinance.
(1)
When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
(2)
When accompanied by an adult authorized and approved by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area.
(3)
When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, provided that the exercise of such right is clearly evidenced by the minor's conduct.
(4)
When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor who has not communicated an object to the police officer.
(5)
When returning home, by a direct route from (and with thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) a school activity of a religious or other parentally-approved association.
(6)
When authorized, by action by the mayor and council or chief of police or his or her assistant, in cases or reasonable necessity. Normally such action by the mayor and council or chief of police permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicly through news media and through other agencies such as the schools and churches, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this curfew ordinance.
(7)

Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, other exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, middle and high schools, will be considered by the mayor and council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97)
Sec. 12-65. - Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the curfew ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97)
Sec. 12-66. - Police procedures.
(a)
A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the curfew ordinance, normally shall take the minor into custody. A parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, and upon arrival the parent shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgement in determining age.
(b)
Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or is known.
(c)
In any event such police officer shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, file a written report with the department.
(d)
When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent.
(e)
In the case of a first violation by a minor, the city, at its discretion, may issue: (1) a warning citation to the minor's parent so as to apprise the parent that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-65 and the penalties in section 12-67; or (2) an actual citation to the minor's parent fully enforcing the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-65 and the penalties in section 12-67.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97; Ord. No. 2015-18, § 1, 6-15-15)
Sec. 12-67. - Penalties.
Prevailing community standards, as to when minors should be off the streets as reflected in this curfew ordinance, are the basis for the following legal sanctions.
(1)
For the first violation by a parent of section 12-65, the parent shall be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) and, for each subsequent violation of 12-65 by that parent, the fine shall be increased by an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00), i.e., two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the second offense, three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the third offense. For purposes of this section, a warning citation given to a parent pursuant to section 12-66(e)(1) shall not constitute the first violation by that parent. The city judge, upon finding a parent guilty, or upon acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, shall sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution, and upon refusal to pay such fine and costs, the parent may be imprisoned for a period not exceeding ten (10) days.
(2)
Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the curfew ordinance more than two (2) times shall be reported to the juvenile court in the county of his residence with an appropriate petition filed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-11-1 et seq.
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97; Ord. No. 2008-15, § 2, 11-3-08; Ord. No. 2015-18, § 2, 6-15-15)

ARTICLE V. - TRUANCY

Sec. 12-80. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Truancy Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97)
Sec. 12-81. - Findings; purpose.
The mayor and council after having received and studied reports compiled by the police department are alarmed and concerned for the safety and well-being of juveniles within the city, as well as with the high number of incidents of thefts, including but not limited to burglary and motor vehicle thefts being perpetrated by juveniles within the city. With the interstate highways, rapid transit system, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport bringing thousands of nonresident transient people into and through the city at all hours of the day and night, juveniles are found to be at a high risk. The national epidemic of drugs and crimes of violence are of such nature that all reasonable and constitutional efforts must be employed to insulate and protect our youthful citizens from the influence and dangers associated with such activities. It is the intent of this article to make the parents the primary agents of enforcement, and, in addition, to enforce the mandatory education requirements in the State of Georgia.
The Official Code of Georgia Annotated provides that any child between the ages of six (6) and sixteen (16) shall be enrolled in and attend a public school, private school, or a home study program. While this requirement supports the state's goal of providing an education to its residents, information has been provided to the mayor and council which indicates an extremely high truancy rate in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The goal of this article, therefore, is to support compulsory education and to reduce the truancy rate within the city.
Parental responsibility for enrolling children in school is required. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effect and, as parental control increases, the likelihood of school absences, juvenile delinquency, and danger to minors decreases. The cooperative enforcement of this article by the city, the parents, and the minor will support the Mandatory Attendance Law, will provide for a more safe and healthy community environment, and will achieve the purposes hereinbefore stated.
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97; Ord. No. 2016-16, § 1, 5-2-16)
Sec. 12-82. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article:
(1)
City is the City of College Park, Fulton and Clayton Counties, Georgia.
(2)
Minor is any person between their sixth and sixteenth birthdays, or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, between the ages of six (6) and sixteen (16) years of age.
(3)
Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor (i) as a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco parentis or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court.
(4)
Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, alone or with others, in such manner that any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in section 12-84 so that is not a mere prohibitory or presence type truancy ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of meaningful phrase "be or remain."
(5)
School day is any day which the Clayton County or Fulton County Boards of Education have scheduled as a day when schools will be open and student attendance is required.
(6)
Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, or road or otherwise.
(7)
Time of day referred to herein as based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the City of College Park, prima facie the time then observed in the College Park Administrative Office.
