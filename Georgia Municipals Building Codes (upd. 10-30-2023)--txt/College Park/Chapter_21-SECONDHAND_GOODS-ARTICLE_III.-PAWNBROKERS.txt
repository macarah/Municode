DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 21-61. - Records required.
(a)
Engaging in the business of buying or accepting in pledge, pawn, exchange, barter or trade used or previously owned goods within the incorporated areas of College Park is hereby declared to affect the public interest due to the opportunity it affords for the disposal of stolen property.
(b)
In the public interest and as set forth herein, all pawnbrokers shall maintain records in sequential order by transaction number documenting all pawn transactions as set forth herein.
(1)
All pawnbrokers shall document an accurate description of each article of property pledged, pawned, exchanged, bartered, traded, or sold to the pawnbroker. Such description shall include, to the extent possible, the manufacturer, model, serial number, style, material, kind, color, design, number of stones if jewelry, and all other identifying names, marks, and numbers. The pawnbroker shall assign a sequential transaction number which shall follow the previous transaction number one by one with no numbers skipped or omitted, documenting each transaction, and ensure each item received is tagged with the pawnshop transaction number.
(2)
A well-focused, properly exposed, color digital photograph of each article pledged, pawned, exchanged, bartered, traded, or sold to the pawnbroker shall be made at the time of acquisition of any article and of each article's serial number, which number shall be clearly visible and readable in the images if imprinted on the article. If the article was never imprinted with any type of serial number, then the image shall show the entire article. All such digital images shall be labeled with the transaction number and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review.
(3)
The tag bearing the pawnshop transaction number must be created and remain attached to the item until the property is disposed of by sale, trade, or other lawful means. This paragraph does not apply to the purchase of property from licensed wholesale or distributor businesses for the purpose of retail sales; however the pawnbroker shall be required to maintain all purchasing records for property exempted from this paragraph.
(4)
The pawnbroker shall require all persons pledging, pawning, exchanging, bartering, trading, or selling property to show proper identification prior to conducting a pawnshop transaction. Proper identification is defined as a government-issued photo identification card such as a driver's license, military identification card, state identification card, or passport.
(5)
The pawnbroker shall also document the name, address, telephone number, race, sex, height, weight, driver's license or other government identification number, date of birth, and social security number of the person pledging, pawning, exchanging, bartering, trading, or selling the property, along with the date and time of the transaction. This documentation shall be made at the time of the transaction and labeled with the transaction number.
(6)
At the time of acquisition of the property by the pawnbroker, the pawnbroker shall make and store a well-focused, properly exposed, digital photograph of the person pledging, pawning, exchanging, bartering, trading, or selling the property. The photograph shall clearly show a frontal view of the subject's face along with the pawnbroker's ticket transaction number. Digital images shall be labeled with the transaction number and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review by law enforcement personnel. Such images shall be stored for a minimum period of four (4) years from the date of creation.
(7)
The pawnbroker shall obtain from each person pledging, pawning, exchanging, bartering, trading, or selling any property, the fingerprint (using an electronic digital fingerprint scanner) of the right hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed. The fingerprint shall be imprinted onto the pawn transaction form in the designated area along with the signature of the person pledging, pawning, exchanging, bartering, trading, or selling the property. The fingerprint must be clear and legible. In the event that more than one pawn transaction form is required, a fingerprint and signature shall be obtained for each form. Fingerprints and the information required herein shall be obtained each time such person pledges, pawns, exchanges, barters, trades, or sells any property.
(8)
Items of property that appear to be new, unused, and in their original packaging cannot be accepted by the pawnbroker unless the customer can supply a copy of the original sales receipt, or other proof of purchase from the place of purchase, to the pawnbroker who shall retain the receipt or proof of purchase on file, labeled with the transaction number.
(9)
The pawnbroker shall store the above documentation, digital images, and digital fingerprints, which shall comprise the record of each transaction, together by the transaction number and shall maintain said records for a period of four (4) years and make them available to law enforcement personnel upon request. Both a hard copy and an electronic copy of these stored records shall be kept on-site, which must be kept safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review, may, if otherwise permitted by law, serve as the permanent record of the pawnbroker.
(10)
All pawnbrokers shall enter the complete record of each transaction as it occurs into the electronic automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system. The administrator of the electronic automated reporting system will electronically transmit all transactions to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority, as defined in section 21-69.

Once the disability or event has been corrected, the pawnbroker shall input the complete record of all transactions taken on paper forms into the automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system.
(e)
The secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority shall designate the required automated reporting system. There will be a regulatory fee assessed to each pawnbroker for each transaction; said fee shall be an amount of four dollars ($4.00) per transaction.
