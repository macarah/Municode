3.21 - Color.
The overall exterior color scheme shall be selected to be harmonious with the neighborhood and blend with the natural surroundings of the site. Consideration shall be given to the compatibility of colors with those existing in the vicinity. The size of the structure and the amount of shading it will receive are also a factor in selection of colors.
A.
Color Hue. Any accent colors shall be of analogous tints, shades or tones. Accent colors may only be approved for very limited use where appropriate to highlight a feature of the design or provide visual interest. The number of such colors shall be limited to no more than two (2) and must be compatible within the overall color scheme.
3.22 - Public Art.
Public art is a valuable design element found in many small towns and can include depictions of local scenery in the form of paintings, murals and mosaics. Artistic expressions on the sides of buildings and on façades can add value, but the designs shall be balanced and appropriate. No explicit commercial message is permitted in murals or other forms of public art. Other public art may consist of statues, pottery, planters and water features such as fountains. All public art on or adjacent to commercial buildings shall be approved by the Mayor and Council.

However, standards must be in place to ensure this practice does not infringe on the rights of others.
1.
Restaurants may place one (1) row of tables outside their place of business unless the building setback permits a greater number of rows. These tables shall be placed adjacent to the front wall of the building, fronting the public right-of-way.
2.
Tables shall not extend beyond the front property line of the restaurant or encroach upon the front building line of adjacent businesses.
3.
Tables may extend into the public right-of-way upon approval by the City Planner and the acquisition of a permit issued by the city.
4.
Dining tables shall not be wider than five (5) feet in diameter.
5.
Access to public stairways shall not be blocked. Tables and chairs shall not interfere with any utilities or other facilities such as telephone poles, fire hydrants, signs, mailboxes, and benches located on the sidewalk or in the public right-of-way.
6.
Tables and chairs shall not impinge on any required clear distances for maneuvering around entrances or exits. The outdoor dining area shall be accessible to disabled patrons and employees.
7.
A minimum of five (5) feet of clear pedestrian access shall be maintained on all sidewalks.
8.
Umbrellas shall be of quality construction and must be designed to be secure during windy conditions. No portion of the umbrella shall be lower than seven (7) feet above the sidewalk.
3.58 - Street Design.
Streets should be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so that pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, motorists and people of all ages and abilities can travel safely and independently.
1.
Streets and sidewalks shall be in compliance with ADA standards for Accessible Design.
2.
Construct continuous pedestrian facilities along all major streets and highways; these shall be direct and interconnect with all other modes of transportation.
3.
Provide safe, secure and convenient facilities for pedestrians into and within commercial development.
4.
Pedestrian crossings shall be adequately marked and signed according to the GDOT Pedestrian and Streetscape Guide.
5.
Relate sidewalk design to the function and the anticipated amount of pedestrian traffic.
6.
All ramps and curb cuts throughout the pedestrian system shall be constructed according to ADA guidelines.
7.
Provide continuous, clearly marked bicycle lanes in accordance with GDOT's Pedestrian and Streetscape Guide wherever possible, especially in congested areas.
8.
Design bikeways and multi-modal facilities to meet a wide range of user needs. Design bikeway and walkway capacity to accommodate the anticipated use.
9.
Provide adequate signage of bikeways and paths.
10.
Provide bicycle parking in commercial and recreational areas.
11.
Incorporate Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) design guidelines for older drivers and pedestrians.
3.59 - Lighting.
Good outdoor lighting serves a number of uses by increasing safety and enhancing the city's nighttime character. However, improperly designed and/or installed lighting can create problems of excessive glare, light trespass, decreased safety and higher energy use. These standards are established to define appropriate lighting characteristics.
A.
General Lighting Guidelines.
1.
Lighting shall be designed to control glare, minimize light trespass onto adjacent properties, minimize direct upward light emission, promote effective security, and avoid interference with safe operation of motor vehicles. The minimum intensity needed for the intended purpose shall be used. This paragraph is not intended to preclude the use of decorative lantern fixtures with visible lamps.
2.
All parking areas, walkways, vehicle entrances and service/loading areas shall provide area lighting sufficient to achieve a minimum of 2.4 foot candles of light as measured at grade or ground level.
3.
Lighting fixtures in parking areas shall be located to assure adequate light levels without displacing planned trees. Light fixture placement shall be shown on landscape plans.
4.
Lighting fixture height, style, design and illumination levels shall be compatible with the building design and height and shall consider safety, function and aesthetics. Lighting fixtures installed along sidewalks shall be pedestrian scale and shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet.
5.
Lighting may be used to illuminate buildings, landscaped medians/islands and grounds for safety purposes and to enhance appearance. The visual effects of such lighting shall be subtle.
6.
Lighting attached to building exteriors or mounted on the ground to reflect upon building exteriors shall be consistent with the architectural style of the building.
7.
Lighting of logos should be compatible with the primary building and respect adjacent buildings. Bright and intense lighting is strongly discouraged.
8.
Blinking, moving or changing intensity of illumination signs are prohibited.
9.
Security lighting shall be shielded and shall focus on the side or rear entry door.
10.
Specialty lighting on outdoor patios, terraces, walkways, and trees helps create a festive atmosphere and encourages nighttime use by pedestrians.
11.
Some alleys and pedestrian ways may also employ a custom decorative lighting system which spans the breadth of the alley. With owner permission, this fixture type could be used in narrow locations where adequate wall support is available.
DIVISION 17. - "T" TRANSPORTATION OVERLAY DISTRICT

3.60 - Scope; Purpose.
A.
Scope. The regulations set forth in this article, or set forth elsewhere in this ordinance when referring to this article, are the regulations of the "T" Transportation Overlay District.
B.
Purpose.
1.
The purpose of the Transportation Overlay District is to provide for the regulation of vehicle parking facilities which either serve as the primary use of a parcel of property or are unrelated to the primary use of such property. These facilities include, but are not limited to, airport parking and shuttle services, car rental agencies and offsite airport related employee parking. College Park's proximity to the airport, as well as access provided by the transportation system, make it a prime location for development of such enterprises. In addition, displacement of past uses of properties adjoining Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport have created large tracts of vacant land near the airport suitable to meet this market demand.
2.
Proliferation of such facilities in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner is not in the best interest of the City of College Park. Such facilities involve vast areas of pavement characterized by three unique features, i.e., a visual "sea of cars", significant stormwater runoff and introduction of significant vehicle traffic. Improper location of such facilities results in negative impact on traffic patterns as well as a strong negative visual impact on surrounding development. Establishment of a Transportation Overlay District which will accommodate such facilities in a concentrated, accessible location is preferred in order to ameliorate the negative effects of such uses. Accordingly, this "single purpose" district is established to concentrate such facilities in specific locations, to buffer such facilities by perimeter landscaping, thereby minimizing the visual impact on the traveling public and surrounding development. Concentration of such facilities further allows economies in the provision of common stormwater detention facilities which might otherwise be constructed on individual sites.
3.
This district is intended as an overlay district allowing establishment of vehicle parking facilities within the configuration of the allowable T-District boundaries in BP, OP, C-2, C-3, HC; M-1 and M-2 Districts. Uses otherwise authorized as permitted uses in the underlying district continue as permitted uses.
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19)
3.61 - Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them:

Commercial parking lots which primarily serve the airport and its related activities but which do not provide shuttle services are nonetheless included in this definition.
2.
Car rental agencies mean those businesses which have as their primary purpose, or as a significant purpose, the furnishing of motor vehicles for hire on a periodic basis and which store vehicles pending their rental so that such vehicles may be available for rental or lease.
3.
Airport related employee parking means parking, whether privately owned or governmentally owned, reserved for employees of Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport or employees working for any person, firm or corporal provides airport related services associated with the airport.
4.
Vehicle parking facilities means surface lots or parking decks dedicated for the parking of vehicles either as a primary use of a parcel of property or as a secondary use of property unrelated to the property's primary use.

3.66 - Buffers.
A.
The potential for negative visual impact on adjoining uses by Transportation District uses is substantial. Therefore, buffers are required for the protection of adjoining land uses.
B.
A natural or man-made planted buffer shall be maintained along the property boundary of any "T" District use which abuts a non-"T" District use according to the following schedule:
1.
Residential districts: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of forty (40) feet shall be provided, provided that should the applicant wish to establish a bermed buffer, such buffer may be reduced to thirty (30) feet for a berm six (6) feet high and thirty (30) feet in depth.
2.
Business park, office park and commercial uses: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of thirty (30) feet shall be provided, provided that if the owner prefers, a six (6) feet high bermed buffer of twenty (20) feet in depth is allowable.
C.
Buffers shall be permanently maintained as indicated on the approved site plan, subject to inspection by the building inspector, and consistent with any other property improvement. The dimension of the buffer shall not be in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this article.
D.
As the purpose of the buffer is to visually screen and distance the uses of the "T" District from adjoining uses one-half (½) of all plant materials shall consist of one (1) or more species that retain foliage throughout the year. Provision of opaque fencing, though desirable, shall not decrease the horizontal dimension of the required buffer.
E.
Within the Transportation District, those uses identified as permitted uses may utilize the buffer requirement in computing the overall percentage of landscaping required by Article XI-C of this appendix. Internal landscaping of the area reserved for parking and paved for that purpose is not required, provided that no decrease in the overall percentage of landscaping on the lot shall be made.
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19)
3.67 - Parking Area Layout, Construction and Maintenance, and Landscape Requirements.
