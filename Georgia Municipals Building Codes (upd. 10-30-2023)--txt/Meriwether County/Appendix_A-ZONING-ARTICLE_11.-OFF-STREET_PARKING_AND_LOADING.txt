ARTICLE 11. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 11.1. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to provide regulations to foster safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and pedestrians on private and public streets and to minimize nuisances from on-street parking.
(b)
However, the provisions of this article 11 will not apply to the off-street parking within either a commercial industrial park district or a planned industrial district since the off-street parking issues are specifically addressed within articles 14 and 15 set forth herein.

Sec. 11.2. - Off-street parking.
(a)
Off-street automobile parking and storage. Off-street parking and storage space shall be provided on every lot on which any of the uses mentioned in this section are established. Such automobile parking or storage space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley and shall be equal in area to at least the minimum requirements for the specific uses as set forth in table 11.1. Each automobile parking space shall be at least nine feet wide and 20 feet long.
(b)
If the required automobile parking or storage space cannot be provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located, the zoning administrator may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space is within 500 feet of such principal use. Such space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
(c)
All off-street automobile parking and storage space except for single-family residential uses shall be so arranged that vehicles will not be required to back onto a public street, road or highway when leaving the premises.
(d)
Gross leasable area (GLA) is the total building floor area in square feet that a developer may lease. Gross floor area is the sum of the areas of floors of a building, including all areas for human occupancy, as measured from the exterior faces of the walls but excluding unenclosed porches, interior parking spaces or any space where the floor-to-ceiling height is less than six feet, six inches.
(e)
Improvement and maintenance. Off-street parking areas shall be graded to ensure proper drainage, surfaced with all-weather gravel, asphalt or concrete materials, and shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and dust-free condition.
(f)
Bumper guards. If the off-street parking area is surfaced with all-weather gravel materials, a bumper guard or wheel-stop shall be installed to mark each space.
(g)
Marking. If the off-street parking area is surfaced with concrete or asphalt, each parking space shall be painted with stripes not less than three inches wide, running the length of each of the longer sides of the space, or by other acceptable methods which clearly delineate the parking space within the parking lot.
(h)
Handicapped parking. Parking for the handicapped within a nonresidential district shall be provided at a size, number and location according to the requirements of the ADA accessibility guidelines (ASAAG) published by the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barrier Compliance Board (ATBCB), as amended.
