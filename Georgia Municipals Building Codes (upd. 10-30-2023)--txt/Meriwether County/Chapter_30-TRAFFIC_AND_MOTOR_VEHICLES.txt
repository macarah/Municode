ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 30-1. - Engine or "jake" braking.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for the driver of any motor vehicle to use an engine brake within the county, except in cases of emergency. For purposes of this section, the term "engine brake" means a braking mechanism which is powered by the exhaust of the vehicle's engine, typically by means of a device to divert the exhaust from the vehicle's engine from its non-braking exhaust system for use in braking. Such a device is commonly referred to as a jake brake, is recognizable by a sudden, loud, engine-centered, braking noise, uncharacteristic when wheel brakes are utilized, and shall be prima facie evidence that an engine brake was utilized by the driver of the vehicle.
(b)
For purposes of this section, the term "emergency" shall mean a situation in which no other means is available to a driver to avoid an accident or another vehicle.
(c)
It is further ordained as follows:
(1)
It shall be unlawful to use a retarder (commonly known as a jake brake or compression brake) on any truck, bus, automobile, or other vehicle with the county.
(2)
This provision shall not restrict the use of a retarder in an emergency as defined above.
(d)
Any person violating this section shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section 1-11.

Sec. 30-2. - Certain uses of rights-of-way prohibited.
(a)
Intent. The county board of commissioners (hereby referred to as the "board") is charged with the protection and maintenance of county roads and rights-of-way and it expends significant sums of public funds from the taxpayers of the county in an effort to do so. The board does hereby find and declare that the use of said rights-of-way as lanes of travel and/or as recreational areas for motorized vehicles damages, accelerates and exacerbates the erosion of the rights-of-way. Thus the board hereby declares that the welfare of the citizens of the county requires it to protect county roads and rights-of-way from damage as set forth herein.
