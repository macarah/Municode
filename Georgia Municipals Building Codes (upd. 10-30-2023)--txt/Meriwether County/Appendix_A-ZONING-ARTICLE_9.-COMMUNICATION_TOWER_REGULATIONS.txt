Sec. 9.2. - Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this ordinance are to:
(1)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout Meriwether County;
(2)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the county is minimal;
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way to minimize the adverse visual impact to the county;
(5)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the county quickly, effectively and efficiently.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, § 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
Sec. 9.3. - Aesthetics.
The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by this ordinance.
(1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping which will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color or colors that is identical to, or is closely comparable with, the supporting structure and/or surrounding area, so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the zoning administrator may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design which would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
( Ord. No. 2020-04, § 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2020 )
