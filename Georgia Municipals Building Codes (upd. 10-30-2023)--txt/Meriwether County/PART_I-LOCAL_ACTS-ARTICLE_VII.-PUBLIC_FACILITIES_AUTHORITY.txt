The authority shall have power and is hereby authorized at one time, or from time to time, to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein defined of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment, or extension of any one or more projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from such part of the revenues and earnings of such project or projects as may be designated in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall be payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 30 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, as such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds. Unless otherwise provided therein, such resolution or resolutions shall take effect immediately. The authority shall, by such resolution, determine the forms of the revenue bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the revenue bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state.

Sec. 7. - Revenue bonds; execution.
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and attested by the clerk and treasurer of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and clerk and treasurer of the authority.
Sec. 8. - Revenue bonds; negotiability and exemption from taxation.
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of this state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and the said bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation with this state.
Sec. 9. - Revenue bonds; sale and price.
The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority, but no such sale may be made at a price less than par.
Sec. 10. - Revenue bonds; proceeds of bonds.
The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit, which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution, authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into such funds as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture.
Sec. 11. - Revenue bonds; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds.
The authority may provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
Sec. 12. - Conditions precedent to issuance of revenue bonds.
Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act.
Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged.
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or of Meriwether County, but such bonds shall be payable solely from such part of the revenues and earnings of such project or projects as may be designated in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds. The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the board of commissioners of Meriwether County to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment thereof, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.
Sec. 14. - Revenue bonds; trust indenture as security.
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, rents, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale, from time to time, of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relating to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be construed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds pledging all or any part of the revenues and earnings of such project or projects may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.
Sec. 15. - Revenue bonds; to whom the proceeds of the bonds shall be paid.
The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or to any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
Sec. 16. - Revenue bonds; sinking fund.
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued and any moneys derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal, of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources not previously pledged and allocated, shall be set aside at regular intervals, as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of:
(1)
The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
(2)
The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
(3)
The necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest; and
(4)
Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as in this Act provided.
The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds issued pursuant to such resolution or trust instrument without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds issued pursuant to such resolution or trust indenture, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.
Sec. 17. - Revenue bonds; remedies of bondholders.
(a)
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act, or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by a resolution of the authority passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, protect and enforce any and all rights granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenue, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.
(b)
In the event that the authority shall default in the payment of the principal or interest on any of the revenue bonds after the same shall become due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption, and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days, or in the event that the authority or any officer thereof shall fail or refuse to comply in any material respect with any agreement made with the holders of the revenue bonds as embodied in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds or the trust indenture securing the same, any holder of such revenue bonds and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent that the rights herein given may be restricted by a resolution of the authority passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, shall have the right to apply in an appropriate judicial proceeding to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver of the project or projects, all or a portion of the revenue from which is pledged to the payment of such revenue bonds. Such right shall exist whether or not such revenue bondholder or such trustee therefor is seeking or has sought to enforce any other right in connection with such revenue bonds. Upon such application, the court, if it deems such action necessary for the protection of the bondholders, may appoint and, if the application is made by the holders of 25 percent in principal amount of such revenue bonds then outstanding or by a trustee for the holders of such revenue bonds in such principal amount, shall appoint a receiver of such project or projects. The receiver so appointed shall forthwith, directly or by his agents and attorneys, enter into and upon and take possession of the project or projects and each and every part thereof, and if the court so directs may exclude the authority, its commissioners, officers, agents and employees and all persons, claiming under them wholly therefrom and shall have, hold, use, operate, manage and control the same and each and every part thereof and, in the name of the authority or otherwise, as to the receiver may seem best, shall exercise all the rights and powers of the authority with respect to such project or projects as the authority itself might do. Such receiver shall maintain, restore, insure and keep insured such project or projects and, from time to time, shall make all such necessary or proper repairs as to such receiver may seem expedient and shall establish, levy, maintain and collect such fees, tolls, rentals and other charges in connection with such project or projects as to such receiver may seem necessary or proper and reasonable and shall collect all revenues and shall deposit the same in a separate account and shall apply such revenues so collected and received in such manner as the court shall direct. Whenever all that is due upon said revenue bonds, and interest thereon, shall have been paid or deposited as provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of said bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, and all default shall have been cured and made good, and it shall appear to the court that no default is eminent, the court shall direct the receiver to surrender possession of such project or projects to the authority, the same right of the holders of the revenue bonds, or of the trustee of the trust indenture, to secure the appointment of a receiver to exist upon any subsequent default as hereinabove provided. Such receiver shall, in the performance of the powers hereinabove conferred upon him, act under the direction and supervision of the court making such appointment and shall at all times be subject to the orders and decrees of such courts and may be removed thereby. Nothing therein contained shall limit or restrict the jurisdiction of such court to enter such other and further orders and decrees as such court may deem necessary or appropriate for the exercise by the receiver of any of the functions specifically set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, said receiver shall have no power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any assets of whatever kind or character belonging to the authority and useful for such project or projects, but the power of any such receiver shall be limited to the operation and maintenance of such project or projects; and no court shall have jurisdiction to enter any order or decree requiring or permitting such receiver to sell, assign, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of any such assets.
Sec. 18. - Revenue bonds; refunding bonds.
The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any premium required for the payment of such bonds prior to maturity. The issuance of such revenue bonds, the maturities and all the details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority with respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.
Sec. 19. - Venue; jurisdiction; service.
The principal office of the authority shall be in Meriwether County and the venue of any action against it shall be in Meriwether County.

Service upon the authority of any process, subpoena or summons shall be effected by serving the same personally upon any commissioner of the authority.
Sec. 20. - Revenue bonds; validation.

The petition for validation shall also make a party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States of America or any department or agency thereof, if subject to be sued, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and are sought to be validated; and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to the validity of such bonds against the authority issuing the same; and the validity of the contract or contracts and of the terms and conditions thereof, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive against the municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the United States of America contracting with the authority if it be a party to the validation proceeding as herein provided for.
Sec. 21. - Interest of bondholders protected.
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this section of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and of the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.
Sec. 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds.
All moneys received by the authority pursuant to this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be the trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act and in such resolutions and trust indentures as may be enacted and entered into by the authority pursuant to this Act.
