(10)
The director of community development may require any additional information and records he reasonably deems necessary. Failure to furnish such data shall automatically serve to dismiss the application.

(11)
Each applicant shall certify that applicant has read this chapter and if the license is granted, each licensee shall maintain a copy of this chapter on the premises and shall require each of the licensee's employees to be familiar with this chapter.

In the event the failure to obtain fingerprinting information from state and federal authorities delays completion of the written report, the sheriff's office may later supplement any fingerprinting information. If the fingerprinting information later reveals that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, this may be grounds for denying the application or revoking a license, despite an otherwise satisfactory written report. Upon production of the criminal investigation report, the sheriff's office shall assemble the application forms and all accompanying documents relating to investigation and processing of the application and deliver such documents to the director of community development for review. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant meets the requirements set by this chapter and the director of community development believes that the applicant may meet all other qualifications of this chapter, then the director of community development shall schedule the application for a hearing at the next regularly scheduled board of commissioners meeting and shall so inform the applicant of this fact before such meeting. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, or if the director of community development finds that the applicant fails to meet all other qualifications outlined by this chapter, then the director of community development shall inform the applicant, in writing, that the application has been denied, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal; said appeal to be before the board of commissioners in accordance with section 4-14. If an applicant desires to appeal a denial by the director of community development, the applicant must file a written request for an appeal hearing with the director of community development within five business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial by the director of community development.
(c)
Any application which the director of community development determines to satisfy all the qualifications outlined in this chapter, including character requirements as contained in the criminal investigation report of the sheriff, shall be scheduled for review at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. At that meeting, the applicant and any person opposed to said application has the right to present to the board of commissioners any information that the board of commissioners determines is relevant to the licensing decision. In making its determination on whether to approve or deny the application, the board of commissioners shall look to the qualifications set forth in this chapter and consider the public interest and welfare. The board shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the application based on the information presented. A decision by the board of commissioners shall be made within 45 days from the date of the board of commissioners meeting unless the decision is postponed for purposes of the board obtaining additional information deemed necessary for consideration of the application. Notice of the decision by the board of commissioners shall be mailed to the applicant. In the event the application is denied, such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal; said appeal to be in accordance with section 4-14.

At the time the applicant makes application for a license, he shall pay to the director of community development's office an amount as set from time to time by the board of commissioners as a nonrefundable sign fee for the posting on the premises where the activities permitted by such license are to be conducted.

This person must be an individual and must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the director of community development in such form as he may prescribe.

Upon approval by the board of commissioners of the application for a license, the director of community development shall issue a license in accordance with the approved application. If the applicant is an individual, the license shall be issued in the name of the individual. If the applicant is a corporation, the license shall be issued in the name of the corporation and in the name of the officer or employee of the corporation primarily responsible for the operation of the licensed premises.

(a)
Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia, DeKalb County, Georgia, and Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the county believes are relevant to the problems faced by Meriwether County, the county takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.
