At the hearing, the department's ADA representative and the grievant shall be given the opportunity to submit pertinent information to the panel.

Sec. 2-2. - Sale or disposition of county-owned uneconomic remnants of real property authorized.
The Official Code of Georgia Annotated provides at § 36-9-3 that "a county governing authority is authorized to sell and convey parcels of small or narrow strips of land, so shaped or so small as to be incapable of being used independently as zoned or under applicable subdivision or other development ordinances or land use plans, or as streets, whether owned in fee or used by easement, to abutting property owners where such sales and conveyances facilitate the enjoyment of the highest and best use of the abutting owner's property without first submitting the sale or conveyance to the process of an auction or the solicitation of sealed bids; provided, however, that each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and shall have the opportunity to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2022-4, § I, 7-11-2022)
Sec. 2-3. - Terms and conditions of sale and disposition.
(a)
If county-owned property is recommended for sale or conveyance pursuant to the authority of this section 2-2 of this article, the governing authority, by and through its county manager, county administrator or other appointed designee, shall determine:
(1)
If the county-owned real property sought to be sold or conveyed pursuant to section 2-2 is no longer serviceable to the county and is appropriate for surplus; and
(2)
If the county-owned real property sought to be sold or conveyed pursuant to section 2-2 meets the criteria set forth in section 2-2 and state law, as amended; and
(3)
The fair market value of such property.
(b)
Upon the satisfactory completion of the steps set forth in subsection (a) above, the county will notify each abutting property owner by personal service, first-class mail, certified mail, return receipt requested and/or electronic mail ("email"), sent to the abutting property owner's last known address or last known email address and to the address of the abutting property if different from the last known address, of the availability of the property and inquiring as to the abutting property owner's ability to purchase the property.
(c)
The notice shall contain the fair market value established by the county, and a statement that the abutting property owner will have 30 days from the date of the notice to express his/her/its desire in writing to purchase the property at the fair market value or for other adequate consideration, as determined by the governing authority. The notice will also include the name of the county representative and his or her contact information to whom such response from each abutting property owner shall be sent.
(d)
If the county receives a response from the abutting property owner wishing to purchase the property, then a recommendation may be presented to the governing authority for its consideration and approval to deem such property unserviceable to the county and to sell and dispose of such property to the abutting property owner for the fair market value or for other adequate consideration, as determined by the governing authority.
(e)
If the county receives a response from more than one abutting property owner wishing to purchase the property, advice and approval as to how to sell or convey the property will be made by and through the county attorney. The goal of such recommendation from the county attorney shall be the disposition of the property that best facilitates the enjoyment of the highest and best use of an abutting property, and consideration shall be given as to whether an equitable division of the property amongst more than one, though not necessarily all, of the abutting owners is appropriate. However, nothing herein shall prohibit the county from selling and conveying the entire property to one abutting owner.
(f)
Nothing contained in this article shall obligate the county in any manner to sell or dispose any property identified hereunder and all sales and conveyances shall be formally approved by the governing authority.
