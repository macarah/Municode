The city treasurer shall have the right to inspect the books or records of the business for which the return was made and, upon demand of the city treasurer, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within thirty days. Failure of submission of such books or records within thirty days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city treasurer at his/her discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under-reporting, an additional payment of occupation taxes required to be paid under this article shall be assessed plus a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the deficiency.

(a)
Upon the failure of any business to pay said occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent, or upon failure to make any of said returns within the time required herein, or upon failure to make a true return, or upon failure to amend a return to set forth the truth, or upon failure to permit inspection of its books as above provided, any business tax registration granted by the city under this article permitting the owner of said business to do business for the current year shall be revoked after notice and opportunity for hearing before the city treasurer, who shall provide the respondent with forty-eight (48) hours notice of such opportunity for hearing in writing at the address within the city or such other notice provided to the mailing address, business location, or other address which shall provide actual or constructive notice of such hearing. No new business tax registration shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city treasurer in accordance with provisions found in section 13-24. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.
(b)
If the city treasurer refuses to issue or revokes a business occupation tax registration, the taxpayer shall have the absolute right to appeal the refusal to issue or the revocation thereof of the occupation tax registration to the governing body in accordance with the appellate process provided in this article. In all cases arising under this section, it shall be the duty of the city to prove that a person or business is in violation of the provisions of this article or ordinances of the city or laws of the state.

Any person, manager, agent, or employee who does business in the city after the registration for said business has been revoked, or who is required to make an occupation tax return and fails to make said return within the time and in the manner herein provided, or who refuses to amend such return so as to set forth the truth, or who makes a false return; and any person, manager, agent, or employee who refuses to permit an inspection of books in his charge when an officer, agent, employee, or representative of the city requests such inspections, during city hall's normal business hours, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided, shall be subject to penalties provided herein. In the case of those practitioners for whom the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax. The penalty shall consist of an additional ten (10) percent of the amount due.

Sec. 14-55.5. - Lien taken for delinquent occupation tax.
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city treasurer, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of twelve (12) percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent; and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by the ordinances and charter of said city and the laws of the state. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution may be levied by the city treasurer upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances and charter of said city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit or illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city treasurer against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

The city treasurer shall administer and enforce the provisions of this article for the registration, levy, assessment, and collection of occupational taxes and penalties imposed in this article; however, any person who is of the opinion that the occupation tax has been incorrectly assessed or that the major line classification is incorrect, or that any other requirement or decision of the city treasurer is in error shall have the right to appeal as follows:
(1)
The aggrieved taxpayer shall first submit in writing to the city treasurer a complaint which shall set forth in reasonable detail the matters complained of. The complaint may take letter form, and it shall be the duty of the city treasurer to review it and to issue a written reply to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the complaint. In the case of a refusal to issue a business occupation tax registration or revocation thereof where there previously has been an opportunity for a hearing before the city treasurer, this step shall be omitted.
(2)
Upon receipt of the written opinion of the city treasurer, the taxpayer, should such person feel the opinion is in error, shall have the right to immediate appeal to the governing body for the purpose of resolving the issue in dispute. An appeal by the taxpayer shall be perfected by filing with the city treasurer a notice of appeal. This notice of appeal shall state in general terms the objections or exceptions taken to the opinion of the city treasurer. The notice of appeal must be filed with the city treasurer within fifteen (15) days following the date of the opinion complained of, and it shall be the duty of the city treasurer to transmit to the governing body all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The appeal shall be heard before the governing body. It shall be the duty of the city treasurer to so notify the appellant in writing of the date, time, and place when the matter shall be heard.
(3)
The governing body may, in conformity with this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the opinion, requirement, decision or determination appealed from. The governing body may direct such action as it deems proper in conformity with this article and it shall be the duty of the city treasurer to carry out the decisions of the governing body.
(4)
An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings with regard to the collection of the occupation tax from the taxpayer but shall not act as a supersedeas in any other respect. The appellant shall have the right to present before the governing body for its consideration any witness or other evidence at the time this matter appealed from is heard. If the city treasurer fails to render a written opinion to the taxpayer within the thirty (30) days as required above, the taxpayer shall be entitled to appeal to the governing body within the time stated above as if the city had rendered an adverse opinion with regard to the complaint.
(5)
If the city treasurer deems it necessary that an audit of the books of the taxpayer be conducted, the city shall so notify the taxpayer in writing of the date, time and place when the audit shall be conducted. If the city treasurer deems it necessary to employ auditors for this purpose, he/she shall recommend it to the governing body and, if it is approved by the governing body, it shall be authorized to employ auditors to audit the books of the taxpayer with the expense of the audit to be borne by the city, if the position of the taxpayer with respect to the occupation taxes is sustained by the audit. If not, the expense of the audit shall be due and payable from the taxpayer.
