ARTICLE IV. - BUSINESS TRAILERS

Sec. 50-100. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the term "trailer" shall be defined to mean a vehicle on wheels or with the wheels removed, in the nature of a house trailer or such other structure commonly known as a house trailer, office trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home. The term "trailer" shall not include modular homes.
(Ord. No. 2015-10, § 1, 12-7-15)
Sec. 50-101. - Finding and intent.
It is of increasing concern of the city council that numerous businesses are located within the city which have no permanently erected structure but are operating and conducting their businesses in trailers and have not commenced construction of a permanent structure for the conduct of their business nor applied for a building permit for such construction. The council further recognizes that great efforts have been made by the city to encourage industrial and commercial development and to attract businesses to permanently locate within the city limits. City council finds and declares that in order to ensure the proper development of commercial and industrial zoned areas within the city and to attract and encourage commercial and industrial developments, the practice of permitting businesses to operate out of trailers should no longer be permitted since it is incompatible with the desired development of the city. Accordingly, city council finds and declares that it is necessary to enact this article so as to prevent the continued operation of businesses out of trailers located within the city limit except under those certain conditions which are specifically set forth herein.
(Ord. No. 2015-10, § 1, 12-7-15)
Sec. 50-102. - Trailers prohibited; exception.
It shall be unlawful for any individual, corporation, business, partnership, unincorporated association or any other legal or commercial entity to place, erect, part or otherwise locate a trailer on property zoned for industrial or commercial use within the corporate limits of the city except as provided in section 50-103 and section 50-105.
(Ord. No. 2015-10, § 1, 12-7-15)
Sec. 50-103. - Trailers associated with construction.
(a)
Any general contractor, subcontractor or owner-builder may locate and use a trailer for the purpose of a use reasonably required in connection with the construction of a permanent structure upon the site where the trailer is to be located upon making written application for a permit to locate same with the building official and receiving the official's approval.
