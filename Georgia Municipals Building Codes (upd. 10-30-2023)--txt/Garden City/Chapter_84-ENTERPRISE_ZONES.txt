Sec. 84-2. - Purposes.
This chapter has been enacted based upon a recognized need for revitalization in geographic areas within the city that are suffering or may suffer from disinvestment, underdevelopment, and economic decline and is intended to provide encouragement and incentives to private businesses to reinvest, renovate, restore, improve and rehabilitate such areas for new housing construction and the economic viability and profitability of businesses and commerce and to generate increased employment opportunities for residents of such areas.
(Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17)
Sec. 84-3. - Qualifying business or service enterprise.
A qualifying business or service enterprise is an enterprise which caused employment to increase by five or more new full-time job equivalents in a designated enterprise zone and which provides additional economic stimulus in such zone. Additionally, the business or service enterprise must engage in new construction; make additions to existing structures; engage in substantial renovation of existing structures; make a significant investment in equipment replacement or expansion; or otherwise alter the physical premises in which the business or service enterprise operates in a manner which adds substantial value to the structures. Cosmetic changes or remodeling to the appearance of a structure which does not increase the assessed valuation of the property by more than 25 percent does not meet the construction or renovations standards of this section. The quality and quantity of such additional economic stimulus shall be determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the city council. In making such determination, the mayor and council may rely upon information provided by the applicant, staff reports, economic studies, or other information determined by the mayor and council to provide a reliable indicator or economic stimulus. The burden shall be on the applicant to establish that the applicant meets the criteria set out in this section. Such business or service enterprise may be new, an expansion or reinvestment of an existing business or service enterprise, or a successor to such business or service enterprise. Whenever possible, ten percent of such new employees shall be low-income or moderate-income individuals, as defined under the Act.
(Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17)
Sec. 84-4. - Designation of enterprise zones.
City council may designate one or more geographic areas as enterprise zones following an analysis of criteria (i.e., pervasive poverty, unemployment, general distress, underdevelopment, general blight) and data described in the Act. Any areas designated as an enterprise zone may be redesignated as an enterprise zone after the expiration of its initial term if the area continues to meet the criteria for an enterprise zone.
(Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17)
Sec. 85-5. - Tax exemption; other incentives.
(a)
Qualifying business and service enterprises in a designated enterprise zone shall be granted an exemption from municipal ad valorem taxes, excluding property taxes imposed by Chatham County and school districts or property taxes imposed for general obligation debt that would otherwise be levied on the qualifying business and service enterprise not to exceed the following schedule:
(1)
One hundred percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the first five years;
(2)
Eighty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next two years;
(3)
Sixty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next year;
(4)
Forty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next year; and

Twenty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the last year.
(b)
If a project consists of new residential construction, residential rehabilitation, or other rehabilitation of an existing structure and the value of the improvement exceeds the value of the land by ratio of five to one, then the exemptions set forth in this section shall apply whether or not the project is carried out by a qualifying business of service enterprise. The tax exemptions pursuant to this paragraph shall commence on the first day of the year following designation of the project as a qualifying project under this paragraph.
(c)
In no event shall the value of the property tax exemptions granted to qualifying business and service enterprises within an enterprise zone created by the city exceed ten percent of the value of the property tax digest of the city.
(d)
For any qualifying business or service enterprise, the tax exemption described in this section shall be effective upon approval by the mayor and council of the business or service enterprise as qualifying. The effective date of the tax abatement shall begin on January 1 of the year following the effective date of approval and such tax exemption shall continue for the predetermined period even if the enterprise zone designation has terminated. A minimum of five new jobs must be maintained throughout the exemption period for a qualifying business or service enterprise to maintain eligibility for the tax exemption. Property tax exemptions granted to business or service enterprises that continue to qualify for the exemption shall continue for the full term of the incentives.
(e)
Other incentives may be granted and will be determined on a case-by-case basis as approved by the city council and may include exemption from any or all of the following:
(1)
Water/Sewer fees; or
