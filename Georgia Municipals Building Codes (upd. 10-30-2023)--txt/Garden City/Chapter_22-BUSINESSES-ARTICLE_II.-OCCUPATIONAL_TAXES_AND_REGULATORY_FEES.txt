Sec. 22-52. - Inspection of books and records.
In any case the city administrator may inspect the books of the business for which the returns are made. The city administrator shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, and, upon demand of the city administrator, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city administrator at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of ten percent of the deficiency and an additional one and one-half percent of the deficiency for each month or fraction thereof that the deficiency was due and unpaid shall be assessed.
(Ord. No. 2005-25, § 1, 10-3-05)
Sec. 22-53. - Revocation of registration for failure to pay tax, file returns, permit inspection of books.
Except for a person whose qualification to practice his profession is determined by the general laws of the state, upon the failure of any business to pay such occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent, or upon the failure to make any of such returns within the time required herein, or upon failure to make a true return, or upon failure to amend a return to set forth the truth, or upon failure to permit inspection of its books as above provided, any business tax registration granted by the city under this article permitting the owner of the business to do business for the current year shall be, ipso facto, revoked. No new business tax registration shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city administrator in accordance with provisions found in sections 22-47 and 22-48. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.
(Ord. No. 2005-25, § 1, 10-3-05)
Sec. 22-54. - Failure to comply with article provisions; continuing in business after registration revoked.
Any persons, their managers, agents, or employees, who do business in the city after the registration for such business has been revoked as above; any persons, their manager, agent, or employee who is required to make occupation tax returns showing the amount of gross receipts and who fail to make such returns within the time and in the manner herein provided, or refuse to amend such returns so as to set forth the truth, or who shall make false returns; and any persons, their managers, agents, or employees who refuse to permit an inspection of books in their charge when the officers, agents, employees, or representatives of the city request such inspection, during business hours, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided for, shall be subject to penalties provided herein.
(Ord. No. 2005-25, § 1, 10-3-05)
Sec. 22-55. - Lien for delinquent tax.
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city administrator, upon any tax or installment of such tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate authorized by O.C.G.A. § 48-2-40 or, if such statute should be repealed or ruled invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of such city and the laws of the state. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on the date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the marshal or other appropriate officer of such city upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances and Charter of such city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have the rights of defense, by affidavit or illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city administrator against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Sec. 22-56. - Effect of amendment or repeal; additional taxes.
This articles shall be subject to amendment or repeal, in whole or in part, at any time, and no such amendment or repeal shall be construed to deny the right of the council to assess and collect any of the taxes or other changes prescribed. Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.

Sec. 22-57. - Effect of article on prior delinquency; enforcement; conflict.
(a)
This article does not repeal or affect the force of any part of any ordinance heretofore passed where taxes levied under such prior ordinance have not been paid in full. So much and such parts of ordinances heretofore and hereinafter passed that provided for the issuing and enforcing of executions for any tax or assessment required by such ordinances, or that imposed fines or penalties for the nonpayment of such tax, or for failure to pay regulatory fees provided for in such ordinance or ordinances, or failure to comply with any other provisions hereof, shall continue and remain in force until such tax, regulatory fee, or assessment shall be fully paid.
(b)
It is hereby made the duty of the city administrator and code enforcement department to see that the provisions of this article relating to occupation taxes are observed; and to summon all violators of the same to appeal before the city's municipal court. It is hereby made the further duty of the city administrator and member of the code enforcement department to inspect all registrations issued by the city as often as in their judgment it may seem necessary to determine whether the registration held is the proper use for the business sought to be transacted thereunder.
(c)
This article shall remain in full force and effect until changed by amendment adopted by the city council. All provisions hereto relating to any form of tax herein levied shall remain in full force and effect until such taxes have been paid in full.
