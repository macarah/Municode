Sec. 82-201. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the Stormwater Management Ordinance of the City of Garden City.
(Ord. of 11-20-95, § 1)
Sec. 82-202. - Authority.

Sec. 82-203. - Findings.
(a)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on health, safety, and welfare of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters.
(b)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property, and human life.
(c)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(d)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(e)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(f)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(g)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the municipal separate storm sewer system.
