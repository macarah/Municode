--- (10) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, adopted Aug. 15, 2011, repealed former Art. V, Div. 1, § 30-230—30-243, and enacted a new Art. Div. 1 as set out herein. Former Art. X, Div. 1 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. of 3-16-98, § 1.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 30-230. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, which could increase incidents of flooding thereby endangering infrastructure, public and private property and human life;
(2)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters water levels and fluctuations and increases pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands, rivers and streams;
(3)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increases primary productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries;
(4)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and poses a serious threat to human health;
(5)
The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and decreases the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers;
(6)
The negative impacts of the land development process on local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the general public as well as the quality of life of its citizens;
(7)
Every residential and nonresidential parcel of real property, both public and private, benefits from the implementation of stormwater management regulations as well as proper maintenance and operation of the municipal storm sewer system (MS4);
(8)
The negative impacts of the land development process can be controlled and minimized through the management of stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads;
(9)
Communities located within Georgia's Coastal Nonpoint Source Management Area and area of special interest are required to comply with a number of state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of the land development process to be controlled and minimized;
(10)
Therefore, the City of Garden City has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process and has established this set of local stormwater management regulations to control post-construction stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 8-15-11)
Sec. 30-231. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing local stormwater management regulations that control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process. The ordinance seeks to achieve these goals by enacting provisions that:
(1)
Protect, maintain, and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety, and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by providing for regulation and management of a municipal storm sewer system, including public and private facilities in the city's service area.
(2)
Comply with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include:
a.
Control the discharge of stormwater and contribution of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges associated with impervious area and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites with impervious area;
b.
Prohibit illicit connections and/or discharges to the MS4;
c.
Control discharge to municipal storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and
d.
Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one municipal/county system to another.
(3)
Establish minimum requirements and procedures to regulate the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and development in flood hazard areas.
(4)
Establishing decision-making processes that can be applied during the site planning and design process to help protect the integrity of local aquatic resources;
(5)
Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the land development process and preserve existing hydrologic conditions on development sites;
(6)
Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help reduce flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources;
(7)
Establishing design guidelines for green infrastructure and stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria;
(8)
Encouraging that green infrastructure practices, which include better site planning techniques, better site design techniques and low impact development practices, be used to the maximum extent practical on development sites;
(9)
Establishing provisions for the long-term inspection and maintenance of green infrastructure and stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; and
(10)
Establishing administrative procedures for the submittal, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved development projects.

DIVISION 2. - STORMWATER UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND

Sec. 30-261. - Purpose.
This division establishes the Garden City Stormwater Utility and sets up the Stormwater Enterprise Fund.
(Ord. No. 2008-28, § 1, 11-17-08)
Sec. 30-262. - Findings of fact.
The Garden City Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The City of Garden City is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Garden City (hereinafter "the city" or "Garden City").
(2)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Garden City is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides benefits to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(3)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff:
a.
May cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city.
b.
Can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system; and,
c.
Contributes to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources.
(4)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(5)
The city is required under federal and state regulations (i.e., the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (hereinafter "NPDES") phase I stormwater permit) to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters.
(6)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase I stormwater permit, NPDES wastewater discharge permit, the coastal comprehensive plan and the city's watershed protection plan will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital drainage projects and other program activities.
(7)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program.
(8)
The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(9)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(10)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(11)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program.
(12)
The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways.
(13)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms.
(14)
The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property such that the amount of impervious surfaces on each property is the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. Therefore, the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(15)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts.
(16)
Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(17)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's storm water management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property.
(18)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(19)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Garden City hereby concludes a stormwater utility, funded by a dedicated stormwater utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the foregoing needs and legal requirements. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a user fee rate structure to establish user fees for the provision of stormwater management services.

Sec. 30-263. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto.
Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities.
Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's topography, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater characteristics, the parcel's on-site operations, the parcel's stormwater controls, the parcel's antecedent moisture as well as the parcel's geologic and hydro-geologic characteristics.
Impervious area shall mean and have the same definition as impervious surface.
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development and causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces such as compacted soil and gravel, which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of rainfall and stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
Improved property (or developed property) means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces.
Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city.
Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to the:
(1)

(c)
It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the municipal boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(d)
If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its council members, mayor, officers, employees or agents.
(Ord. No. 2008-28, § 1, 11-17-08)
Sec. 30-267. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be adopted via the rate ordinance and be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 2008-28, § 1, 11-17-08)
Sec. 30-268. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
(a)
All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Garden City Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
(b)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the mayor and city council, the city may elect to sue in municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Garden City Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in a similar manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Chatham County Superior Court.
(c)
The city shall have the right for its employees or designated agents to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes:
(1)
Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site;
(2)
Verification and review of information contained within a stormwater utility credit manual application; and
(3)
Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.

(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-282. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a customer's stormwater user fee charge in recognition of a customer's efforts to mitigate the stormwater runoff impact that developed property has on the city stormwater management services and systems, and/or the efforts of a customer to offset the city's cost for implementation of stormwater management program (SWMP) activities such as public education, watershed stewardship, etc.
Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility, designed for occupancy by a single-family unit.
Manufactured home park means a common development (with a single-property owner or entity) of more than two factory-built or pre-fabricated housing structures that have been partially or entirely assembled at another location and moved into the development.
Residential equivalent unit (REU) means the stormwater user fee charge billing unit increment related to the median horizontal impervious surface area footprint of 3,000 square feet for a typical single-family residential parcel within Garden City.
Unless otherwise defined within this article, the definitions included in the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund Ordinance (Code section 30-261 et seq.) are adopted herein by reference.
The professional engineering and financing analysis documents entitled: The Garden City SWMP Assessment Funding Feasibility Study (Technical Memorandum dated November 14, 2007); The Garden City SWMP Assessment Funding Feasibility Study Addendum (Technical Memorandum dated November 12, 2008, or the most recent version); and applicable supporting, project-related documents are incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-283. - Stormwater utility customer classes.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system components. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:
(1)
The SFR class shall consist of all developed properties classified as single-family residential customers per the applicable definition.
(2)
The NSFR class shall consist of all developed properties classified as non-single-family residential customers per the applicable definition.
(3)
The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition.
(b)
Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-284. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall recover the cost of providing stormwater services and facilities by imposing a stormwater user fee on all developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater services provided by the city.
(b)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the mayor and city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of Garden City. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and together with other funding sources available to the Garden City Stormwater Utility such as special service fees and charges deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council to customers for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management (e.g. credit application fees, plan review fees, development inspection fees, regulatory compliance inspection fees and other fees related to provision of stormwater management services), are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city.
(d)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of residential equivalent units (REUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each REU shall correspond to 3,000 square feet of impervious surface.
(1)
Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered impervious surface and included in the customer's REU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 90 percent of the total REUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. Application of the 90 percent factor to these materials is based on applicable literature sources and reference documents outlined in the applicable sections of the project documents cited in section 30-282.
(e)
Calculation of charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be $4.75 multiplied by the number of REUs for each customer account.
(1)
The number of REUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge shall be in accordance with the following:
a.
SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 REU per month unless one of the conditions outlined below applies:
1.
If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e. a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 REU per month for billing purposes.
2.
If the SFR property has an impervious surface amount that exceeds 9,000 square feet (or three REUs) then a custom stormwater user fee bill will be calculated for the customer account using the NSFR user fee charge calculation approach outlined herein.
b.
NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged one REU for each 3,000 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of REUs for billing. Fractional REUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of REUs for billing each month.
c.
Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned zero REUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill.
(f)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed on the customer's monthly public utility bill (except as stipulated below) starting with the first billing cycle in February 2009 as called for in this article and the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund Ordinance.
(1)
Customers that do not receive a monthly public utility bill from the city shall be billed for stormwater services via another method and frequency established by the city administrator.
(2)
The property owner will be charged for the total impervious surface for residential customer accounts that are part of a larger common development such as manufactured home parks and apartment complexes.
(3)
The city will generally bill the property owner's tenant for the stormwater user fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services (i.e., water, sewer, and/or sanitation). In selected cases, it may be necessary for the city to bill the landlord or property owner for stormwater services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the user fee charges to multiple accounts on a site is not practical.
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-285. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
(a)
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities.
(b)
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the rail road company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way road and drainage conveyance systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county improved properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties.
(4)
Chatham County owned public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the county. However, other improved property used for county purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-286. - Stormwater user fee charge credits.
(a)
The Stormwater utility manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the Stormwater Utility Credit Manual (credit manual), which is incorporated into this division by reference and made a part hereof. Copies of the credit manual will be maintained by and made available from the stormwater utility manager.
(1)
Customers may apply for credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual.
(2)
A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual.
(3)
Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the customer. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual or this article.
(4)
In order to obtain a credit, the customer must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit manual.
(5)
The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format described in the credit manual. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to review and approval of a stormwater utility credit application by the city. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing.
(b)
When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he/she shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is received to approve the credit in whole, approve the credit in part, or deny the credit. The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. Credits applied for by the customer and approved in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit manual.
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-2-09)
Sec. 30-287. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
Failure to receive a stormwater utility user fee charge bill is not justification for nonpayment. The property owner and/or utility customer account holder, as identified from city public utility billing database information and public land records of Chatham County, shall be obligated to pay the applicable stormwater user fee charge.
(1)
Billing.
a.
Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue February 1, 2009, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the stormwater utility customer of the following items (as a minimum): the stormwater user fee charge amount (less any approved credits), the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
b.
Unless otherwise billed directly to the property owner, the stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected on a common statement and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be sent to the property owner.
c.
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city administrator.
d.
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be ultimately obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments.
e.
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period.
(2)
Delinquencies and collections.
a.
Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property.
b.
A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law and city ordinance provisions. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(3)
Adjustments.
a.
The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
1.
If a customer believes his/her stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city.
2.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer.
Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
3.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision.
4.
In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater user fee charge for the property is correct.
5.
The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
6.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater user fee charge bill.

The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the city administrator a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof.
