Sec. 70-63. - Lots.
All lots which shall hereafter be established within a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards:
(1)
General standards. The following general requirements shall apply to all lots hereafter established within a subdivision:
a.
Street access. Each lot shall abut on a street which shall be dedicated as a public street and which conforms to the design requirements of this chapter; provided that the mayor and council may approve a residential, commercial or industrial lot which does not abut a public street but which is served by a perpetual privately maintained access easement which meets the design and construction standards of this chapter.
b.
Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be as nearly as practical at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.
c.
Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall be provided with sufficient width and depth to permit the establishment of front yard building setback lines from both streets.
d.
Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots shall only be permitted where it shall be found necessary to separate a development from major arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
e.
Minimum lot elevation. No lot shall be approved that does not contain a suitable site of sufficient elevation to permit a finished floor elevation of at least the level of the 100-year flood. The entire lot shall be properly drained.
f.
Residential lots in floodplain. Residential subdivision lots shall be prohibited within floodplain areas where the cost of providing governmental services in the area would pose an unreasonable economic burden.
(2)
Lot width and areas.
a.
Single-family dwelling lots. Lot size requirements are as follows for single-family dwellings including but not limited to: manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each dwelling to be constructed on the recorded lot. See Table MT-1 and subparagraphs 1. through 7. as follows:
EXPAND
Table MT-1

Minimum (Min) Lot Sizes, Minimum Lot Widths and Maximum (Max) Allowable Sewage Flow for the Type of Water System
Type of Water Supply System

(Individual) Public
Min Lot Size 43,560 square feet 21,780 square feet
Min Lot Width 150 feet 100 feet
Max Sewage Flow 600 gpad** 1,200 gpad
*In this context "Nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system, which is not a "public" water supply system.
**gpad = gallons per acre per day = gal/acre/day
  1.
The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three or four bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Chatham County Board of Health and city will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
2.
The Chatham County Board of Health and city may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
3.
For determining compliance with the above-mentioned lot width requirements, all lot widths shall be measured at the minimum building setback line. Single-family dwelling lots served by a public water supply system or non-public water supply system shall also be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet, respectively, within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located.
4.
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: Rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, soil conditions that exclude the installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
5.
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
6.
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed those quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
X =   5,000 gal/day
1,200 gal/acre/day
X = 4.17 acre
X = 41.7 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
X = 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine Y = the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
Y =   5,000 gal/day
600 gal/acre/day
Y = 8.33 acre
Y = 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
Y = 363,000 ft 2 acre of land needed
7.
Homes served by septic tank and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified in Table MT-1.
(i)
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area;
(ii)
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
(iii)
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(b)
The following Table MT-2 sets forth the lot size requirements for multi-family residential dwellings, all other non-single-family dwellings and commercial structures, and this also includes mobile homes located in commercial mobile home parks. For determining compliance with such lot size requirements, all lot widths shall be measured at the minimum building setback line.

Sec. 70-64. - Blocks.
All blocks hereafter established within a subdivision shall conform to the design standards set out in this section. In order that there may be convenient access between various parts of a subdivision and between the subdivision and surrounding areas, and in order to help prevent traffic congestion and traffic hazards, the length of blocks hereafter established shall not exceed 1,800 feet.
(Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2103))
Sec. 70-65. - Easements.
The following kinds of easements shall be required within subdivisions:
(1)
Utility easements.
a.
Public utility easements shall be provided where necessary. Such easements shall be not less than 15 feet in width and shall be centered on side or rear property lines when possible.
b.
The location, elevation and construction of all public utilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets, shall be such as to minimize or eliminate damage by flooding.
(2)
Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way, which shall conform substantially with the lines of such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream or shall be of such additional width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.
(3)
Maintenance easements for drainage canals. Where a drainage canal is of such size that it requires mechanical means for cleaning, such as a dragline, there shall be a 12-foot access easement on either side of such canal for access purposes.
(Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2104))
Sec. 70-66. - Water supply and sanitary sewerage.
Water and sewerage facilities shall conform to the following requirements:
(1)
When feasible, every portion of a subdivision shall be served by public water, and, when feasible, as determined by the mayor and council, every portion of a subdivision shall be served by a sanitary sewer system. All such systems shall be designed to preclude infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into floodwaters.
(2)
Where either public water or public sewers or both are not available to a subdivision as determined by the mayor and council and a subdivider shall decide to establish a private water supply system and a private sewer system, the plans and specifications for such private water system and sewer system shall be approved by the county health department and the mayor and council. Any such private systems shall be so located as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during times of flooding.
(3)
Publicly owned water and sewer systems must be constructed in accordance with county health department specifications, sewer systems must connect to an existing publicly owned treatment plant, where practical, and both water and sewer systems and trunk lines shall be conveyed to the city.
(4)
Fire hydrants in residential subdivisions shall be no more than 400 feet from the center of the lot at the building line (distance being measured along hose lay). Non-residential subdivisions shall have fire hydrants no more than 500 feet apart. The placement of fire hydrants is subject to the approval by the City of Garden City Volunteer Fire Department. Fire hydrants must be on looped lines. All fire hydrant outlets are to be 18 inches to 22 inches above finished grade. All hydrants shall be equipped with self-draining valves and feet, and hydrants shall have one four-and-one-half-inch steamer connection and two two-and-one-half-inch connections. In commercial and industrial areas, hydrants shall be of the breakaway variety, and this type of hydrant is recommended for all areas.
