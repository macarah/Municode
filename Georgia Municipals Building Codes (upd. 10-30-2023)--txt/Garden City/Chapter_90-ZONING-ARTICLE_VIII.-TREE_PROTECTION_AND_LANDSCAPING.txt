Editor's note— Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1, set out provisions intended for use as Ch. 30, Art. IV, §§ 30-400—30-418. For purposes of classification, these provisions have been included as Art. VIII, §§ 90-251—90-271, per city.

Sec. 90-251. - Purpose.
This tree protection and landscaping ordinance has been developed to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of the city. The intent is to create an opportunity for and to promote the protection of the city's natural resources and promote growth in a way that will provide a healthy environment for the city's future. The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the protection of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and to protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The regulations of this tree protection and landscaping ordinance shall be the definitive, unless otherwise directed by the zoning ordinance or City Code of Ordinances.
In accordance with this Ordinance, the owner/developer is to adhere to the following requirements:
(1)
Site density requirements.
(2)
Specimen tree requirements.
(3)
Parking lot tree requirements.
(4)
Landscape planting strip requirements.
(5)
Buffer zones.
(6)
Screening requirements.
(7)
Building landscape requirements.
It shall be the duty of the planning director, under authority of the city administrator, to enforce the provisions and requirements of this article. The planning director has the authority to issue a variance for no more than one of the requirements listed above. Variances for more than one of the requirements listed above must be approved by the Garden City Board of Appeals.

(2)
An area along some natural feature designated to protect and/or preserve the essential character of such feature and allow it to be maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition;
(3)
A natural, undisturbed portion of a lot, except for approved access and utility crossings, which is set aside to achieve a visual barrier between the use on the lot and adjacent lots and/or uses. A buffer is achieved with vegetation, and must be replanted subject to approval by the city when sparsely vegetated. Clearing of undergrowth from a buffer is prohibited unless it is to be replanted to buffer standards.
(4)
Land area used to visibly separate one use from another through screening and distance, to shield or block noise, light, glare, visual, or other conditions, to block physical passage to non-similar areas, or to reduce air pollution, dust, dirt, and litter. Also "buffer area" or "buffer strip."
Caliper means a measure of the diameter of a tree trunk for the purpose of size grading or classification.

(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-253. - Applicability.
(a)
The terms and provisions of this article shall apply to all activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance activity permit on any real property within the city. No clearing, grubbing, grading, or other removal of existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage may occur until it is determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of this article and other applicable city codes and regulations.
(b)
Exemptions from the provisions of this article include the following project types:
(1)
Grandfathered projects. Any property included within the limits of a LDA Permit (land disturbance activity permit) approved prior to the effective date of this article.
(2)
Horticultural or agricultural operations. Land clearing for clearly agricultural purposes, including legitimate timber harvesting operations which qualify as forestry land management practices or agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17, as amended, on land zoned for or used for forestry, silvicultural, or agricultural purposes; plant or tree nurseries; orchards, are exempt.
This exemption shall not include tree harvesting incidental to the development of land, or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for nonhorticultural uses. Further, the operation of legitimate timber harvesting shall provide a 50-foot undisturbed buffer measured from the property line provided and maintained along all road frontages, during the land disturbance activity, except for authorized access crossings. As a minimum the buffer shall meet the buffer standards stipulated in this Ordinance.
Any persons or firms performing legitimate timber harvesting operations in any incorporated area of the city for delivery as pulpwood, logs, poles, or wood chips to any wood yard or processing plant located inside or outside the State of Georgia shall provide notice of such legitimate harvesting operations to the city administrator or the designated agent thereof prior to cutting any such timber. The notice to the city shall include:
a.
Prior written notice of legitimate timber harvesting for each separate tract to be harvested thereby;
b.
A map or the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested and, as to those trucks which will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, the main point of ingress to such tract from a public road and, if different, the main point of egress from such tract to a public road;
c.
A statement as to whether the timber will be removed pursuant to a lump sum sale, per unit sale, or owner harvest for purposes of ad valorem taxation under O.C.G.A. § 48-5-7.5;
d.
The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest; and
e.
The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber.
The notice may be submitted in person, by transmission of an electronic record, via facsimile or by mail.
The persons or firms subject to such notice requirement shall deliver a bond or letter of credit to the city, in which case notice shall not be or remain effective for such legitimate harvesting operations unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the city administrator or its designated agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting the city against any damage caused by such person or firm in an amount specified by the city not exceeding $5,000.00 or, at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber, a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of and in lieu of such bond. The surety bond or letter of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered.
The notice shall be effective for such harvesting operation on such tract within the city upon receipt of the same by the city or its designated agent and, if applicable, compliance with the above surety requirements of this section and until such time as the person or firm giving such notice has completed the harvesting operation for such tract; provided, however, that any subsequent change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice shall be reported to the city or its designated agent within three business days after such change.
Violation of the notice requirements of this section shall be punishable by a fine of $500.00. Each day of a violation shall be considered a separate offense.
Once legitimate tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations, no other land disturbing activities shall be permitted on the entire property where the legitimate tree harvesting operations are conducted for a period of three years after completion of the legitimate tree harvesting operations. For purposes of this paragraph the last date of legitimate tree harvesting shall be the last day in which a legitimate tree harvesting operation is conducted. The property owner who conducts a legitimate tree harvesting operation within the city shall be required, within 30 days of the last day of legitimate tree harvesting operations, to deliver to the city administrator a written notice setting forth the last day of the legitimate tree harvesting operation and the identity and location of the property. Upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city administrator as provided above, the city administrator shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available, which estimated date shall not be rebuttable.
(3)
The removal of diseased or infested trees. Removal upon advice and written finding of the county extension service, Georgia Forestry Commission, a certified arborist, or a state registered urban forester.

Sec. 90-254. - Permitting procedures.
(a)
A tree removal permit is required to remove any tree from any property. The fee for obtaining a tree removal permit will be in addition to the land disturbance activity permit fee. Some tree removal permits may be granted without a tree removal fee. See, in this regard, code subsections 90-267(a)(1) and 90-271(e)(1)(a). If any tree larger than eight inches in diameter is removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the city's tree removal permit fee. Minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in re-plantings.
(b)
Prior to the submission of any permit drawings, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the planning director to discuss the tree protection/landscape ordinance as it relates to the applicant's property. The purpose of the pre-submittal conference is to clarify the provisions and procedures of this article and review applicable standards and guidelines for the submittal of documents, and required tree protection, replacement, and maintenance measures.
(c)
A tree protection and replacement plan shall be prepared and submitted with other permit drawings, as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process to the planning and economic development department. These plans will be reviewed by the planning director for compliance with the city zoning ordinance and this Ordinance in particular and either approved, denied, or returned for revisions. Any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings. The plans shall then be resubmitted (along with previous red line comments), with the necessary changes, following the same procedure as if it were an original application. Issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection plan/replacement plan.
(d)
An approved tree protection and replacement plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvements, he shall request an inspection by the city. If the city approves the installation, the project will be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the city does not approve the plan, the city shall submit a report stating the reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a re-inspection shall be requested.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1; Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 11-17-08)
Sec. 90-255. - Tree protection and replacement.
The trees in the City of Garden City are a city resource worth protecting and maintaining. Existing trees shall not be disturbed, except as provided in this article. No person shall cut carve or otherwise damage any tree. No person shall attach rope, wire, nails, or advertising posters to any tree. No person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see section 90-259 "Specimen Trees"). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. "Reasonable effort" shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-256. - Planning and design consideration.
(a)
Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone (CRZ). Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied:
(1)
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection.
(2)
The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area defined as the critical root zone.
(3)
Tree protection and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. A grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree, yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention should be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills.
(4)
Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones. Developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines, including irrigation and electric lighting, with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones.
(5)
Construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc. shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the city.
(6)
Sidewalks often appear innocuous on plans, but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements. Considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk. Drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-257. - Protection of existing trees.
(a)
Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to:
(1)
Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials;
(2)
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching;
(3)
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment;
(4)
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc.
(b)
Existing trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have a four-foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones. For methods of tree protection, see subsections (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section 30-406. Tree protection devices shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed. No construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas. Areas designated for parking, materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees.
(c)
The city will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this article. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the city.
(d)
Methods of tree protection. The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction. These guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots, trunks, and limbs by chemical, mechanical, and other means. Tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed.
(1)
Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the city. Barriers will be a minimum four feet high. Construction of the fence shall conform to the detail provided in Appendix B [to this chapter]. All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete.
(2)
Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their critical root zones not within 60 feet of any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four-foot orange plastic safety fencing or continuous plastic flagging. Tree protection materials shall consist of heavy mil, plastic flagging, a minimum four inches in width with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area. Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous durable restraint. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity.
(3)
Boring. No open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Any exceptions must be approved by the city. Utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a twenty-four-inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method.
(4)
Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation.
(5)
Clearing adjacent to tree save areas. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g. with a ditch witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees.
(6)
Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation. All roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-258. - Determination of site density factors.
(a)
All projects within the city, with the exception of the construction of individual single-family and detached dwellings, shall maintain (in perpetuity) or exceed a minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre.
Minimum tree site density shall be calculated as shown below
EXAMPLE:
Total acres 25
- Area of buffers 5
___________
Net area 20 acres
Required minimum site density = 16 units × 20 acres = 320 units required.
(b)
The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, and or planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. Unit values are computed as provided at Appendix C [to this chapter].
(c)
Existing and proposed trees outside established zoning buffers can be used for density credit. Proposed trees shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards.
(d)
The minimum sized existing tree that will count toward tree density credit is eight inches caliper DBH. All existing trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried as specified in Appendix C [to this chapter].
(e)
New trees shall be provided utilizing a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development.
(f)
Individual single-family lots are required to provide a site density factor of two tree units per acre. This density shall be achieved by planting a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three with a minimum of one shade/canopy required. Shade/canopy trees shall be at least ten feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. Understory shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. A minimum of 50 percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. All residential lots shall require that improvements be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. Existing trees that are protected and saved on the lot can be credited toward the lot density requirement as well as the overall subdivision requirement.
(g)
Where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum site density factor can not reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings. A variance for parking must be filed with the city prior to such activities.
(h)
Any tree, designated on the tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the city, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged.
(i)
Trees which are used to meet the tree density requirements shall be maintained for two years after the date of final inspection and kept in perpetuity. It is the responsibility of the property owner to maintain tree health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced within 45 days in conformance with the approved landscaping plan.
(j)
The developer/owner shall guarantee all plant materials for a minimum of two years from implementation. The city shall inspect said improvements and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. The owner shall be notified by letter of any replacements or restoration that must be made to maintain compliance with this article. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced within 45 days in conformance with the approved landscaping plan.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)

(a)
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but [is] not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees.
(b)
The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify:
(1)
Size criteria:
a.
Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): Twenty-seven-inch diameter or larger.
b.
Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): Thirty-inch diameter or larger.
c.
Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.); Eight-inch diameter or larger.
(2)
Condition criteria:
a.
Life expectancy of more than 15 years.
b.
Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay.
c.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
d.
No major insect or pathological problem.
(3)
A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgment of the city:
a.
It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance.
b.
It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape.
c.
It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(c)
Replacement of specimen trees.
(1)
In the event any specimen trees are to be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace the specimen trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality.
(2)
Specimen tree replacement will be required, in addition to the minimum required tree density requirements.
(3)
Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, and equal to the unit value of the specimen tree removed.
(4)
Disturbance or encroachment into the critical root zone of a specimen tree exceeding 30 percent of the root zone will constitute the loss of the tree and require recompense as described in subsection 30-408(c)(3) above.
(5)
In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 24 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) equal to the unit value of the specimen tree.
(6)
Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city must be replaced by trees equaling two times the unit value of the specimen tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be four-inch minimum caliper. The condition criteria stated above will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-260. - Parking lot tree requirements.

j.
The perimeter of all parking areas shall be landscaped as a minimum with groundcover or turf.
k.
Where parking lots abut a public right-of-way a ten-foot-wide landscape strip should be provided between the property line and the back of curb or edge of pavement. The strip should contain a continuous evergreen hedge to screen parking lot. Plantings in the hedge should be spaced such that a continuous hedge is created within three years of planting. The hedge should not exceed three feet in height or block vehicular site distance at the site entry. This requirement shall be coordinated with any requirement of section 30-410, "Landscape Strip Planting", when requirements overlap.
l.
Where parking lots abut side or rear property lines or differing uses within mixed use developments the strip should contain a continuous evergreen hedge to screen the parking lot. When a parking lot abuts an undisturbed zoning buffer this requirement can be waived by the city.
m.
Trees shall be planted at a minimum of three feet from any curb, so as to prevent injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the striping between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Curb stops must be used to prevent vehicle overhang into required landscape strips and parking islands when curbing is not used.

As of completion of site improvements, the property owner shall have an implied easement on rights-of-way extending from the site to the road pavement in order to complete the required maintenance.
(6)
Where existing tree-save areas abut the public right-of-way, the landscape strip requirements may be waived at the discretion of the city.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-262. - Buffers.
modified
(a)
Buffers are required to achieve a visual barrier between properties of different use. However, existing or proposed plant material located within a buffer cannot be applied toward density requirements of a site. The area of a buffer can be subtracted from the total area of a site when calculating density requirements.
(b)
Buffer widths shall be as indicated in this Ordinance or as allowed by variance or zoning conditions. Buffer plantings can be located within the setback limits required by zoning. In the case where buffer zones are wider than setback requirements, the buffer zones supersede. Unless otherwise directed by zoning or this Ordinance, buffers shall remain undisturbed. When existing vegetation exists in a buffer it shall be protected from encroachment during construction.
(c)
Where buffers are void of existing vegetation adequate enough to provide a visual barrier or the buffers have been violated, the owner/developer is responsible for replanting. Refer to the buffer examples below for a formula based on the square footage of the entire buffer or portion thereof that is void of adequate material.
(d)
Adequacy of the undisturbed buffers to provide a visual barrier will be determined by the city based on visual analysis and the types of existing plant material and reserves the right to require remedial evergreen understory planting if it is determined that the undisturbed buffer does not provide an adequate visual buffer.
(e)
The city encourages the control or elimination of invasive plant material including Chinese Privet, Kudzu, Wisteria, etc. Selective clearing in buffers to remove noxious or invasive plant material and the methods of removal will require the approval of the city. Selective buffer clearing will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Removal of material may require the replanting to buffer standards if the buffer is over cleared.
(f)
Buffer zones shall be provided as follows:

The use of climbing spurs or irons is not approved in pruning operations on live trees. This type of work is a potentially hazardous occupation and is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered with workers compensation, property damage, public liability, and completed operations insurance.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-269. - Maintenance and fiscal surety.
For all developments other than single-family residential subdivisions, trees planted to meet the requirements of this article shall be subject to a maintenance period.
Fiscal surety for the maintenance of said trees shall also be required in accordance with procedures provided in this article. The amount of the surety shall be 110 percent of the cost of all required plant materials and the cost of the installation and guarantee of those materials. The surety may be in the form of an escrow agreement, letter of credit or maintenance bond. The surety shall be prepared on forms provided by the planning and economic development department. The expiration date of the surety instrument shall be determined as 30 months from issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
If the original developer sells, transfers, assigns or conveys in any manner all or a portion of the property prior to the expiration date of the surety instrument, the original developer shall maintain the surety instrument until the expiration date. However, if an alternative surety instrument satisfactory to the planning and economic development department is provided by the subsequent owner of the property, the original developer may be partially or totally released from the developer's obligation under the original surety instrument upon receipt of written notification from the planning and economic development department accepting the alternative surety instrument. The alternative surety instrument must satisfy all requirements of the tree protection and landscape ordinance.
Prior to the release date of the fiscal surety, an inspection will be performed by the city to determine the health of all planted trees. Any plant materials that are dead, missing or in a state of irreversible decline at the time of the inspection must be replaced by the responsible party named on the surety instrument. The planning and economic development department shall provide the responsible party with a written evaluation of what trees need to be replaced and the time frame within which replacement is to occur.
All or part of the surety may be called if the conditions of the city's maintenance inspection letter are not met.
It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject to this article to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Planting beds shall be mulched to prevent weed growth and maintain soil moisture. Plant materials shall be pruned as required to maintain good health and character. Turf areas shall be mowed periodically. All roadways, curbs, and sidewalks shall be edged when necessary in order to prevent encroachment from adjacent grassed areas.
All undisturbed buffers shall be maintained to insure the containment of invasive plant material. A listing of invasive plant material can be found in the "Invasive Plants of Georgia's Forests", published by the Georgia Invasive Species Task Force (www.gainvasives.org). The spreading of any material from the buffer onto adjacent property or into the public right of way is not permitted. The property owner is responsible for the control of this material and may be subject to a fine if these areas are not maintained.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-270. - Plant establishment.
(a)
The city encourages and has adopted the use of xeriscape planting. A manual for xeriscape planting can be found in "Xeriscape: A Guide to Developing a Water-Wise Landscape" published by The University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service (http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/B1073.htm).
(b)
As a minimum to facilitate maintenance and help establish plant material required by this Ordinance, water shall be made available in the following method:
(c)
Provide a water resource (hose connection) within 200 feet of all plantings to facilitate hand watering as necessary to establish planting.
(Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1)
Sec. 90-271. - Single-family residential requirements.
The following requirements refer to owner-owned, single-family residential lots. This section does not pertain to developers.
All of the information provided in this section can be found in previous sections of this article classified under the specific criteria or categories. The items listed below are an overview of the landscape ordinance requirements for a single-family residential lot owner. Refer to the specific section listed for any additional requirements that must be met.
(a)
Site density requirements. (Refer to section 90-258).
(1)
Individual single-family lots are required to provide a site density factor of two tree units per acre. This density shall be achieved by planting a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three with a minimum of one shade/canopy required. Shade/canopy trees shall be at least ten feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. Understory shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. A minimum of 50 percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. Improvements on residential lots shall be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. Existing trees that are protected and saved on the lot can be credited toward the lot density requirement.
(2)
The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, and or planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. Unit values are computed as provided at Appendix C [to this chapter].
(3)
The minimum sized existing tree that will count toward tree density credit is eight inches caliper DBH. All existing trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried as specified in Appendix C [to this chapter].
(b)
Specimen tree replacement. (Refer to section 90-259).
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees.
(1)
The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify:

Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): Twenty-seven-inch diameter or larger.
2.
Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): Thirty-inch diameter or larger.
3.
Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.); Eight-inch diameter or larger.
b.
Condition criteria:
1.
Life expectancy of more than 15 years.
2.
Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay.
3.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
4.
No major insect or pathological problem.
c.
A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgment of the city:
1.
It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance.
2.
It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape.
3.
It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality.
(2)
Replacement of specimen trees.
a.
In the event any specimen trees are to be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace the specimen trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality.
b.
Specimen tree replacement will be required, in addition to the minimum required tree density requirements.
c.
Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, and equal to the unit value of the specimen tree removed.
d.
Disturbance or encroachment into the critical root zone of a specimen tree exceeding 30 percent of the root zone will constitute the loss of the tree and require recompense.
e.
In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 24 months following completion of construction, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) equal to the unit value of the specimen tree.
f.
Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city must be replaced by trees equaling two times the unit value of the specimen tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be four-inch minimum caliper. The condition criteria stated above will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city.
(c)
Screening. (Refer to section 90-263).
Screening shall consist of the visual blocking of views of onsite service equipment and areas. The following items shall be screened as indicated below.
(1)
Heating and cooling units for all developments including single-family shall be adequately screened with vegetation so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjoining properties.
(2)
Plants shall be spaced so as to provide for effective visual screening within three growing seasons.
(d)
Building landscape requirements. (Refer to section 90-264).
This section relates to landscaping required adjacent to proposed buildings that are subject to this article including single-family residences. Any building subject to a building permit will be required to provide a five-foot-wide landscape strip along any face of the building that faces a public way. Landscaping in this area shall be comprised of a combination of shrubs and understory trees that soften the facade of the building. The following combination of plant material shall be provided:
Building landscaping:
a.
Provide one understory tree per 25 feet of building width. The required understory tree must be a minimum of six feet tall at installation and should be chosen from the city's approved plant list.
b.
Provide one evergreen shrub per four linear feet of building width. The required shrub must be a minimum of 24 inches tall at installation.
c.
Building width is defined as the width of the portion of the building that faced a public right-of-way.
(e)
Single-family residential requirements; tree removal.
(1)
Within the city, a tree removal permit is required prior to the removal of trees. A permit will be necessary regardless of whether a permit fee is assessed. Exemptions from permit fees include the following:
a.
The removal of trees on actively residential or residentially-zoned property, without cost of a person or company engaged in removing the trees for a fee, shall not require the payment of any permit fee until more than three trees are removed at a time within a single calendar year. The removal of more than three trees at a time within a single calendar year will require a fee per acre based on the fee schedule determined by the city.
(2)
Specimen tree removal regardless of location will require a permit.
(3)
If any tree larger than eight inches in diameter is removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the city's tree removal permit fee. All contractors for tree removal must be licensed, bonded, and insured.
(4)
Trees shall be removed in accordance with accepted industry standards and procedures and in accordance with the following minimum requirements:
a.
Extreme care shall be taken so as to prevent limbs, branches, and trunks from falling and creating damage to adjacent homes, driveways, sidewalks, trees, shrubs, streets, and other property, both public and private. The city recommends that this type of work is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered by workers compensation, property damage, public liability and completed operations insurance.
