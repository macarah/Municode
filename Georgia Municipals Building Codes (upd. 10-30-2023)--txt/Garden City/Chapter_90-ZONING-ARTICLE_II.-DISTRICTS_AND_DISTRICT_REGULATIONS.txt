Sec. 90-43. - Designation of P districts.
modified
(a)
Before an area shall be designated as a P district on the zoning map for the city, a conceptual development plan shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission. The planning commission may disapprove, approve, or modify the plan in order to secure an orderly development pattern in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.
(b)
The planning commission may, on its own motion, recommend approval of a P district. If such recommendation is approved, the developer shall be required to submit a general development plan to the planning commission for approval prior to development of the site.
(c)
The conceptual development plan for a proposed P district shall include proposed uses and overall development standards and shall indicate the proposed use or reuse of all land, open spaces, location of major streets, recreation areas, school sites, religious centers and such other plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the building official in a preapplication conference to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. Such plan shall promote an environment of stable and desirable character in harmony with the established or proposed land use pattern in surrounding areas.
(d)
Within a P district, no development shall take place until general development plans or subdivision plats, where required, shall have been submitted to the planning commission staff for review and are approved.

(g)
General development plans approved by the planning commission shall be certified to the building official for the issuance of applicable permits. No development shall take place within a P district that is not shown on a general development plan as certified by the planning commission.
(h)
Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular district; provided that the planning commission may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the developer on a finding that such variances:
(1)
Would be in keeping with the overall character of the area.
(2)
Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this chapter.
(3)
Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses.
(4)
Would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced.
(i)
When an area is rezoned to a P District classification, the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the standard zoning classification identification for the area in question.

(1)
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the centerline of a street, highway, railroad, right-of-way line, stream bed or riverbed, or such centerline extended, then such centerlines shall be construed to be such boundaries.

(3)
Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following lot lines or such lot lines extended, then such lot lines or such lot lines extended shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
