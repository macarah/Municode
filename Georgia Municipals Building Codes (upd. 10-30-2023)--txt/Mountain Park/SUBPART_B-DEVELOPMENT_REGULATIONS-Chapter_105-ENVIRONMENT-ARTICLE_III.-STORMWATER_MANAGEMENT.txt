Sec. 105-141. - Enforcement of article provisions.
This article shall be enforced by the code compliance officer or such person as appointed by the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 207, § 2(2), 9-18-1995)
Sec. 105-142. - Findings.
(a)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters. The potential impacts of these pollutants and nutrient loadings include:
(1)
Changing natural ecosystems through sediment and pollutant deposits which affect the quantity and quality of water flow, the destruction of habitats, and the loss of plant and animal life;
(2)
Posing significant health risks through increased bacteria;
(3)
Accelerating eutrophication of receiving waters by introducing excessive nutrient loads;
(4)
Increasing metal deposits creating toxicity for aquatic life;
(5)
Reducing oxygen levels because of oil, grease and organic matter; and
(6)
Affecting animal and plant life, adversely, due to changing temperatures of receiving waters.
(b)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(c)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff as follows:
(1)
Erosion and slumping of streambanks, resulting in widening of streams;
(2)
Undercut root systems;
(3)
Increased erosion rates; and
(4)
Uniform and shallow streambeds, providing less varied aquatic habitats.
(d)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above may result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(e)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(f)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the city's stormwater system.
(g)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the stormwater system.
(Ord. No. 207, § 3, 9-18-1995)
Sec. 105-143. - Objectives; purpose.
(a)
Protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the shortterm and longterm public health, safety, and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by:
(1)
Protecting, preserving, and enhancing water quality and fish and wildlife habitat within the city and in downstream receiving waters; and
(2)
Protecting those downstream from water quality and quantity impacts.
(b)
Compliance with state and federal stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The objectives of these regulations include:
(1)
Controlling the quality of water discharged by controlling the contribution of pollutants to the stormwater system by stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity;
(2)
Prohibiting illicit discharges to stormwater systems;
(3)
Controlling the discharge of spills and dumping or any disposal of materials other than stormwater into the stormwater system; and
(4)
Controlling, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one municipal system to another.
(c)
Requiring development plans to minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters by requiring approval and implementation of stormwater management plans for activities which may have an adverse impact on community waters.
(d)
Establishing procedures which minimize damage from flooding caused by development, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial.
(e)
Requiring construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems.
