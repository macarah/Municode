(m)
Multistep sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.

After bid opening, corrections in bid openings shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After the bid opening, no changes in bid price or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the city or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid corrections, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
(1)
The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
(2)
The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids or to cancel the awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the council.
(k)
Award of contract. The city, by majority vote entered in its minutes, shall award the contract to the lowest reliable bidder, provided that the city shall have the right to reject any and all such bids whether such right is reserved in the public notice or not and, in such case, may readvertise, perform the work itself, or abandon the project.
(l)
Award. The contract shall be awarded with responsible promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. If the low responsible and responsive bid for a construction project exceeds available funds as certified by the city council, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the council shall approve and authorize when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, negotiation of an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsible and responsive bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
(m)
Multistep sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(n)
Performance bonds in the procurement of road construction services. When a road construction contract is awarded in excess of $5,000.00, the following bonds or security shall be delivered to the city and shall become binding on the parties upon execution of the contract:
(1)

(2)
A payment bond satisfactory to the city, executed by a surety company registered to do business in the state or otherwise secured in a manner satisfactory to the city, for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material to the contractor or its subcontractors for the performance of the work provided for in the contract. The bond shall be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the price specified in the contract.
(3)
The above stated bonds shall not be modified or released without a vote of council approving such modification or release.
(4)
A road construction contract subject to the above stated performance and payment bond requirements shall require the contractor as a condition of performance to keep in force during the term of the contract the insurance outlined below from an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Georgia. The insurance policy shall name the city as an additional insured. A certificate of insurance shall provide the city a 30-day written notice in the event of cancellation, non-renewal or adverse changes to the policy. A certificate of insurance documenting the below stated amounts of insurance shall be furnished to the city at the time of execution of the road construction contract.

ARTICLE V. - CODE OF ETHICS[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 299-09, § 1, adopted August 17, 2009, repealed the former Art. V, §§ 2-201—2-219, and enacted a new Art. V as set out herein. The former Art. V pertained to code of ethics for city officials and derived from Ord. No. 268-03, § 1, adopted Dec. 15, 2003.

Sec. 2-201. - Purpose.
The purpose of this code of ethics is to:
(1)
Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the city;
(3)
Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and
(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who fail to abide by its terms.
(Ord. No. 299-09, § 1, 8-17-2009)
Sec. 2-202. - Scope.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials.
This article is intended to supplement, rather than conflict with provisions of state and federal law and the City's Charter. Whenever the provisions of this article place a greater ethical duty or burden upon a city official than required by law or Charter, then this article shall control. Should any portion of this article be found to conflict with the procedural requirements of any law or the Charter, then this article shall be construed in a manner that complies with the law or Charter provision.
(Ord. No. 299-09, § 1, 8-17-2009)
Sec. 2-203. - Definitions.
Solely for the purpose of this code of ethics:
City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include city employees, but does mean the mayor, members of the city council, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city clerk, city attorney, and all other persons holding positions designated by the City Charter, as amended. The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city council or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the council, board, or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city.
Immediate family means the spouse, mother, father, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of any city official related by blood, adoption or marriage. The relationship by marriage shall include in-laws.
Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.
Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public.
Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where:
(1)
The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or
(2)
The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous 12 months either equal or exceed (a) $5,000.00 in salary, bonuses, commissions or professional fees, or $5,000.00 in payment for goods, products or services, or (b) ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less; or
(3)
The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city council; or

(j)
No city official shall use city facilities, personnel, equipment or supplies for private purposes, except to the extent such are lawfully available to the public.

Sec. 2-206. - Advisory opinions.
The city attorney shall render a written advisory opinion based on a real or hypothetical set of circumstances when requested in writing by any elected official subject to the provisions of this Code, and it shall be a responsibility of the city attorney for the interpretation of this Code in rendering such opinions.

Whenever a complaint is filed against a city official acting in reliance of an advisory opinion issued by the city attorney, the Municipal Court may rule upon the merits of the city attorney's interpretation of the code, but shall take the city official's justifiable reliance upon the advisory opinion into consideration in determining the culpability of the city official.

Complaints under this article shall be filed no later than 365 days after the facts giving rise to the ethics violation occurred.
To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes, complaints will not be accepted against a person seeking election as a city official, whether currently serving as a city official or not, from the date qualifying opens for the elected office at issue through the date the election results for that office are certified. The time for filing complaints will not run during this period. Properly filed complaints will be accepted and processed after the election results have been certified.

Upon receipt of the complaint, the city solicitor shall review the ethics complaint to determine whether it is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the court. The solicitor may dismiss complaints that in his or her discretion do not merit prosecution; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the city solicitor shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official. If the solicitor determines that the complaint does merit prosecution, then the solicitor shall present the case in the same manner as other ordinance violations.
(e)
Upon the conviction of the violation of this ethics ordinance, the court shall impose a sentence consistent with the provisions of this article, and shall cause a copy of the court's order to be delivered to the city clerk.
