Sec. 22-145. - Standards.
(a)
Small wireless facilities and new, modified, or replacement poles to be used for collocation of small wireless facilities may be placed in the public right-of-way as a permitted use: (i) upon a receipt of a permit under [this article]; (ii) subject to applicable codes; and (iii) so long as such small wireless facilities and new, modified, or replacement poles to be used for collocation of small wireless facilities comply with the appropriate provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-66C-7(h).
(1)
New, modified, or replacement poles installed in the right-of-way in a historic district and in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed fifty (50) feet above ground level.
(2)
Each new, modified, or replacement pole installed in the right-of-way that is not in a historic district or in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed the greater of:
a.
Fifty (50) feet above ground level; or
b.
Ten (10) feet greater in height above ground level than the tallest existing pole in the same public right-of-way in place as of January 1, 2019, and located within five hundred (500) feet of the new proposed pole;
(3)
New small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way and collocated on an existing pole or support structure shall not exceed more than ten (10) feet above the existing pole or support structure.
(4)
New small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way collocated on a new or replacement pole under section 22-144(a)(1) or (2) may not extend above the top of such poles.
(b)
A decorative pole should only be located where an existing pole can be removed and replaced, or at a new location where the city has identified that a streetlight is necessary.
(c)
Unless it is determined that another design is less intrusive, or placement is required under applicable law, small wireless facilities shall be concealed as follows:
(1)
Antennas located at the top of poles and support structures shall be incorporated into the pole or support structure, or placed within shrouds of a size such that the antenna appears to be part of the pole or support structure.
(2)
Antennas placed elsewhere on a pole or support structure shall be integrated into the pole or support structure, or be designed and placed to minimize visual impacts.
(3)
Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and mounted on a pole shall be placed as high as possible, located to avoid interfering with, or creating any hazard to, any other use of the public rights-of-way, and located on one (1) side of the pole. Unless the radio units or equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic signage, radio units or equipment cabinets mounted below the communications space on poles shall be designed so that the largest dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite side of the pole on which they are placed.
(4)
Wiring and cabling shall be neat and concealed within or flush to the pole or support structure, ensuring concealment of these components to the greatest extent possible.
(5)
Permittees shall not place or maintain signage on communications facilities, including small cell facilities or utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities, in public rights-of-way, unless otherwise required by federal or state law, provided; however, existing structures that lawfully supported signage before being repurposed may continue to support signage as otherwise permitted by law.
(6)
A small wireless facility shall not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by applicable codes, local codes or regulations, a permit issued by the city, or state and federal laws and regulations or as permitted by the city.
(7)
All proposed new or replaced utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities shall meet the design standards contained in this code section, or the license agreement and permit, unless waived by the major and city council.
a.
A replaced or restructured utility pole to accommodate the deployment of a small wireless facility shall be in the same location as the original utility pole.
b.
The replaced or restructured utility pole shall be substantially similar in finish, base and pole design, diameter, material and height as the original pole being replaced, unless the city requires a different design, color or composition to be consistent with applicable city standards for new utility poles.
(8)
New utility poles shall be designed to be substantially similar in design to other utility poles in the same block or vicinity of the public right-of-way. Such design aspects to follow include the material, base, pole diameter and style, location and style of attachments, finish, and cap, as applicable. By way of example, if existing utility poles in the same area of the public rights-of-way are light poles, the new utility pole should be designed substantially similar to such light poles and to the extent consistent with location context regulations, equal distance between existing poles. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any such stealth utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility shall function in the same manner as the facility it is intended to resemble in compliance with the Code, at the expense of the permittee. By way of example, if a permittee installs a utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility to resemble a nearby light pole, the facility should include a light that is operated in the same manner as other light poles, at the applicant's expense unless and until ownership of such pole is transferred to the city.
(9)
Notwithstanding this subsection, if the proposed location of a new utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility is within a public right-of-way that is within a particular special district, zoning district, character area, overlay district, historic district or property, or a homeowners' association that has design standards applicable to utility poles, such proposed utility pole shall substantially comply with such design standards.
(10)
This subsection does not authorize the installation of a new utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility in a location that is otherwise prohibited pursuant to court order or applicable codes.
(11)
Attachment authorization. Any small wireless facilities that require installing, collocating, modifying or replacing wireless attachments and ancillary equipment to a pole or support structure, or otherwise attaching or using a third party's pole shall require, in addition to obtaining a permit, the applicant to submit evidence that the applicant has authorization allowing the placement of the small wireless facility on the pole or other support structure.
(12)
Small wireless facilities and wireless attachments shall be operated and maintained in a manner that does not interfere with public safety, utility, or public works equipment.
(d)
Stealth design for deployment of small wireless facility.
(1)
Wires, cables and equipment to be deployed on a utility pole shall be within the utility pole or if not possible to being installed within the utility pole, covered with a shroud. No exposed wires or cables are permitted.
(2)
If the utility pole for the proposed deployment of a small wireless facility is a light pole, a street light fixture substantially similar in design to the existing street light fixture shall, to the extent technically feasible, be used to camouflage the small wireless facility such as through replacement of the cobra head with a new cobra head containing the small wireless facility, or a side-mounted light may be replaced with a substantially similarly designed side mounted light containing the small wireless facility. Unless consistent with the design of the utility pole, a small wireless facility shall not be deployed on a mast of a utility pole. Any street light fixture installed by the permittee shall be maintained in good working order by the permittee at its cost unless and until ownership of such pole is transferred to the city.
(e)
Wireless equipment not deployed on utility poles or existing structures.
(1)
Ground-mounting wireless facility up to twenty-eight (28) cubic feet, in dimension shall be located within a ten (10) foot radius of the existing structure or utility pole for the collocated small wireless facility.
(2)
The ground-mounted wireless facility shall be architecturally designed consistent with the city's design style. Ground-mounted wireless facilities up to twenty-eight (28) cubic feet shall have a non-reflective finish of a neutral color consistent with the predominant background color of the attachment or the surrounding landscape and placed on a concrete base surrounded by appropriate landscaping for the area. Alternatively, the permittee may propose a small wireless facility that would be substantially similar in terms of material, design and color finish to other at-grade city owned infrastructure within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed location in the public rights-of-way such as waste receptacles or city rights-of-way infrastructure.
(3)
To the extent consistent with applicable codes, at the city's direction the permittee owner of a ground-mounted small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way shall conceal the facility with landscaping and plantings consistent with other landscaping in the area. In areas with landscaped swales, the small wireless facility must be within the swale and concealed with consistent landscaping. Landscaping and plantings pursuant to this subjection shall be subject to the city's approval and be maintained by the permittee at its sole cost and expense consistent with the Code for so long as the small wireless facility remains in the public rights-of-way.
(f)
Undergrounding provisions.
(1)
Applicant shall comply with nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements that prohibit electric utilities, telecommunications or cable providers from installing structures in the rights-of-way without prior zoning approval in areas zoned for single family residential use, provided such requirements shall not prohibit the replacement of existing structures with structures whose design the city expressly consents to.
(g)
Development standards. In addition to the requirements detailed elsewhere in this article, the following development standards shall apply to all small wireless facilities governed by this article:
(1)
Any small wireless facility attached to a pole hosting a street light, traffic light, or other public safety purpose shall only be permissible to the extent it does not interfere with the operation of any public safety function or public safety communications. If in the city's sole discretion it is determined that a particular pole or location cannot support a small wireless facility, without interfering with or otherwise affecting the reliability performance, safety, or other functional aspects of such a pole, the city may deny a permit to install small wireless facility on such a pole, or to construct a new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure, at such a location, to the extent permissible by law.
(2)
All small wireless facilities shall incorporate concealment elements to the maximum extent technically and economically feasible and as appropriate to the site and type of facility. Specifically, all small wireless facilities shall employ and maintain camouflage design techniques to minimum visual impacts and provide appropriate screening. Such techniques shall be employed so that the installation, operation, and appearance of the small wireless facilities will be consistent with the character of the surrounding area or the structure to which the small wireless facility is attached.
(3)
Wireless providers may place new poles or wireless support structures in the rights-of-way, but only where there are existing above-ground utility poles and the poles must be removed if other such poles are removed, unless those poles would meet the requirements of this subsection as permissible new poles. Specifically, and furthermore, a new pole is only permitted if the applicant can show:
a.
Existing utility poles or other support structures cannot be used to support the small wireless facilities, or would require a modification that would make the addition of an additional utility pole or wireless support structures less intrusive or safer;
b.
The pole or support structures to be installed will be similar in size and design to existing poles, and placed approximately to minimize intrusiveness and to avoid creating undue hazard to persons or property; and
c.
The applicant demonstrates that the denial of the application would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, within the meaning of 47 USC §332(c)(7) as interpreted by precedent binding in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
(4)
Every new utility pole or wireless support structure shall be a monopole rather than a lattice tower or guy-wire support tower, unless otherwise authorized.
(5)
No facility shall be built so as to cause the right-of-way in which the facility is located to fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or otherwise obstruct access.
(6)
All facilities shall be designed so as to be resistant to and minimize the opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions, which would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight, or attractive nuisances.
(7)
Any equipment that is not installed underground shall be screened by structures, topography, or vegetation to the maximum extent technically and economically feasible. Coaxial cables, conduit lines, and electrical boxes for ground-mounted wireless equipment shall be placed underground or within approved structures to the extent feasible.
(8)
Wireless providers shall be encouraged to design small wireless facilities to serve as public art, flagpoles, or artificial natural features such as trees or rocks where such designs are appropriate and technically and economically feasible.
(9)
Unless otherwise required by city, county, state, or federal rules or regulations, small wireless facilities shall have non-reflective finish and shall be neutral color consistent with the predominant background color.
(10)
Signal lights or illumination shall be prohibited unless required by the FCC or Federal Aviation Administration.
(11)
The facilities shall not bear any signage, other than certification, warning, information, safety, and directional signage, or other non-commercial signage required by law, or expressly permitted by the city.
(12)
Any facility occupying a city-owned pole is only permissible to the extent the existing function of the pole is not impeded. In particular, street lights and traffic lights' power supplies may not be used by applicants. When attaching to city-owned poles, applicants are responsible for securing separately metered power for their facilities, and are responsible for any and all costs incurred in modifying a pole to support additional power supplies. In all other cases, applicants are responsible for ensuring that their power supply arrangements with electric utilities do not result in any incremental cost increase to the city.
(13)
In the event a replacement pole is required, the applicant shall notify the pole owner of the date of the city's action approving the new pole and the old pole shall be removed within ninety (90) days of the placement of the replacement pole.
(h)
Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, an applicant may collocate a small wireless facility within a historic district, and may place or replace a pole within a historic district, only upon satisfaction of the following:
(1)
Issuance of a permit under [this article]; and
(2)
Compliance with applicable codes.
(i)
Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, an applicant may collocate a small wireless facility on a decorative pole, or may replace a decorative pole with a new decorative pole, in the event the existing decorative pole will not structurally support the attachment, only upon satisfaction of the following:
(1)
Issuance of a permit under [this article]; and
(2)
Compliance with applicable codes.
(j)
Whenever possible, each provision of this article, will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this article is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this article will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein.

(b)
No permit for construction issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless construction has actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
(Ord. No. 35-19, 9-19-19)
Sec. 22-147. - Waivers.
A request for waiver of the design standards for a proposed small wireless facility that does not satisfy these design guidelines shall be submitted to the public works department for review and approval prior to the permittee submitting an application. The city manager or designee reserves the right to submit any application for small wireless facility permit to the city council with notice to the applicant, to determine if such proposed facility is consistent with the city's objective design standards. The city shall approve or deny the request for a waiver in writing within thirty (30) calendar days. If a decision is not received by the applicant on day thirty (30), the proposed design is deemed approved. After thirty (30) calendar days, the applicant shall submit its application, which the city shall process in accordance with the timelines established by O.C.G.A. Title 36, Chapter 66C.
