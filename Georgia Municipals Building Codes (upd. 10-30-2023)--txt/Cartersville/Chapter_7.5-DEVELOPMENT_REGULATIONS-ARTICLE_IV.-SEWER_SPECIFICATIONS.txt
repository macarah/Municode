(3)
Definition of sewer line terminology.
(a)
"Building sewers" or "service laterals" are defined as those pipes used to convey wastewater from the building or portions of a building to a main sewer. The minimum diameter for a service lateral is six (6) inches. These sewers are privately funded and owned.
(b)
"Main sewers" are located in streets, rights-of-way or dedicated easements. They are gravity piping systems used to collect sewage from one (1) or more service laterals to other main sewers. Main sewers are a minimum of eight (8) inches in diameter and may extend beyond the property boundaries of a development. Funding of main sewers is by the developer.
(c)
"Force main sewers" are pressure piping systems which convey sewage from a pump station to a main sewer. These sewers are constructed of ductile iron pipe and have a minimum diameter of four (4) inches. Funding of force mains is by the developer.
(d)
"Private sewerage systems" are all non public sewer systems as approved by the water superintendent pursuant to chapter 24 of this Code.
(4)
When public sewers are not available. If sewers are not adjacent to the property, the following options are available:
(1)
Provide a private sewerage system pursuant to sections 24-80 and 24-81 of this Code.
(2)
Extend city sewers to the area.

(1)
Generally. All projects which involve construction of main sewers and/or force mains, pumping facilities, and private sewerage systems shall have detailed construction plans and specifications prepared by a registered professional engineer or licensed surveyor licensed in the state. Developments which only involve building sewers may have plans and specifications prepared by the project architect.
(2)
Preliminary review. Preliminary plans will be prepared and submitted for review as described elsewhere in the development regulations. Questions relating to availability of sewers and proposed location of connection should be resolved at this stage before proceeding with final planning. A submittal for preliminary review must include all land to be developed although the land is to be developed in several phases or units. Availability determinations will be made only for the phases of the project proposed for current construction. Availability determinations will be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of project approval. The developer must submit any data required for accurately projecting sewer flow quantities and rates. The developer is also responsible for furnishing any other information deemed necessary for evaluating service feasibility.
(3)
Sewer construction plans. All plans for public and private sewer facilities shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined herein and as required in regulations promulgated by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The developer shall be responsible for submitting plans and other data to the state EPD for required approvals.

(7)
Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits.
(a)
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the city for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits or sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the streets and other appurtenances.
(b)
All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide, ten (10) feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten (10) feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved.
(c)
Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a state registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner.

(d)
The engineer shall furnish appropriate drawings for submittal to the appropriate permitting agency of any state or federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines, or any other utility lines on which the sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall be eight and one-half (8½) inches × eleven (11) inches and shall show a plan view and profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name or number of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface, or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sewer will be shown. The drawing will show the type of material to be used for the sewer and the method of construction to be used. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the controlling authority of the facility on which the sewer is encroaching. A minimum of five (5) copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. The engineer is also responsible for furnishing a completed encroachment permit application ready for signature by department superintendent. Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with.
(Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98)
Sec. 7.5-93. - Design criteria and materials for sewers.
(1)
Generally. The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the city water department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature.
(2)
Types of sewers. All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted.
(3)
Design period. Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed along the entire road frontage of the property where gravity service is feasible and to the uppermost property line of the development being served.
(4)
Capacity and size determinations. In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered:
(1)
Maximum hourly sewage flow.
(2)
Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants.
(3)
Ground water infiltration.
(4)
Topography of the area.
(5)
Depth of excavation.
New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than four hundred (400) gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half (2½) times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds (⅔) pipe diameter.
The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination.
(5)
Special city requirements.
(a)
Distance between manholes. Maximum distance between manholes shall be four hundred (400) feet.
(b)
Depth. Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five (5) feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be fifteen (15) feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of twelve (12) feet unless otherwise approved. Any sewers on off-street easements shall have a minimum of three (3) feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed.
(c)
Drop across manholes. All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of one-fourth (0.25) feet.
(d)
Detection tape. Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals.
(6)
Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two (2.0) feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:
Minimum Slope in Feet
EXPAND
Sewer Size
(in inches) Per 100 Feet
8 0.40
10 0.29
12 0.22
14 0.17
15 0.15
16 0.14
18 0.12
21 0.10
24 0.08
    These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two (2.0) feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on ten (10) percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See standard details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be twenty (20) percent and sewers shall be designed at less than ten (10) percent whenever possible unless otherwise approved.
(7)
Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a large one (1), the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation.
(8)
Gravity sewer pipe materials. The city reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through fifteen-inch diameter will normally be polyvinyl chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile iron pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of DIP). For eighteen-inch diameter pipe and above, the contractor may have the option of using either polyvinyl chloride (PVC), reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), or ductile iron pipe. Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details):
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six (6) inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench.
For ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of pipe.
In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe.

The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the city's discretion, the city may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling.
(5)
Minimum inspection by developer. The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer:
(a)
Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring as-built distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole.
(b)
Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done.
(6)
City inspection. Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer.
(a)
Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover.
(b)
Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least eighty (80) percent of a full circle when observed from one (1) end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches (1½) of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine failing sections of sewers.
(c)
Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits.
(d)
Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two (2) tests per five hundred (500) feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one (1) additional area will be tested as well.
(7)
Other testing requirements. The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city. The city will be notified at least two (2) days prior to these tests.
(a)
Mandrel test for PVC pipe. Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to ninety-five (95) percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter):
1.
Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel.
2.
During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line (a nylon ski rope is recommended).
3.
After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe.
4.
Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered.
5.
Draw the mandrel through the sewer line.
6.
An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine locations of failing sewers.
7.
Retest.
(b)
Air pressure test. A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs):
1.
Temporarily plug the line segment between two (2) manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested.
2.
Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches four and one-half (4.5) psig above ground water pressure, if any.
3.
Wait at least five (5) minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure.
4.
Bleed internal air pressure to exactly three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure.
5.
Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to two and one-half (2.5) psig above ground water pressure.
6.
The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown on the following table:

18 144 48 516
21 180 54 588
24 216
  Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement.
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the city witnesses a successful test on each line segment.
Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two (2) feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe.
(c)
Manhole testing. All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test.
1.
Exfiltration test. Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one (1) hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two (2) gallons/foot of depth/foot of manhole diameter.
2.
Vacuum test. Vacuum testing of manholes for watertightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten (10) inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of sixty (60) seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine (9) inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine (9) inches, the manhole has failed.
(8)
Final inspection and conditional acceptance. In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the city. The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project.
After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter, certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the twelve-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development.
At the end of twelve (12) months, the subdivision inspection team will again reinspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system.
(9)
Maintenance bond or letter of credit. The developer shall post a maintenance bond or letter of credit of ten (10) percent of the total project cost on the facility for an eighteen-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city for all projects whose costs exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00).
(10)
Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for a twelve-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the twelve-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the sewer system for operation.
