Sec. 24-175. - Monthly load management credit.
Customers who reduce their billing demands, as defined below, will receive a monthly credit to the amounts rendered under the city's PL-5 rate schedule, or its successor(s), of four dollar ($4.00) per kilowatt of load reduction below the customer's normal fifteen-hour average demand, if known. If not known, the normal average fifteen-hour demand will be estimated and agreed upon by the customer and the city prior to billing under this rider. At the end of each contract year, the estimated normal average fifteen-hour demand may be adjusted to reflect actual usage and prior billing will be corrected and rendered to the customer for payment or refund. The resulting normal average shall not exceed eight-five (85) percent of the average of the customer's monthly peak demands during June through September.
(Ord. No. 20-95, 6-22-95)
Sec. 24-176. - Determination of billing demand.
(a)
The billing demand shall be based upon the average of customer's hourly metered demands that coincide with the fifteen (15) highest MEAG system loads occurring during the period from June 1 through and including September 30 of the current contract year, which is June 1 through May 31. Until that date and times of the fifteen (15) highest MEAG system hourly peaks are determined, an estimate of the customer's billing demand, mutually agreed upon by the customer and the city, will be used to bill the customer. When the actual billing demand has been determined, the customer subsequently will be billed on the basis of the actual billing demand, and all prior bills during the contract year will be recalculated and rendered to the customer for payment or refund based upon the actual billing demand.
(b)
The determination of the billing demand may be modified in the future to reflect changes in wholesale billing demand determination to the city by MEAG. This rider may be reviewed periodically by the city as its appropriate compensation and applicability.
