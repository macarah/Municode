ARTICLE V. - CODE OF ETHICS

Sec. 2-170. - Basic constitutional principles of ethical governance.
All government, of right, originates with the people and is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. See Georgia Constitution, Article I, Section II, Paragraph I.
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03)
Sec. 2-171. - Public servants are trustees.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principal policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are:
(1)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(2)
The Constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the state and ordinances of the city should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct.
(3)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(4)
Elected officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.
(5)
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality, and equality.
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03)
Sec. 2-172. - Intent.
It is the intent of this code of ethics that neither the mayor nor any member of city council shall knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties, or which would tend to impair his or her judgment or actions in the performance of his or her official duties. Furthermore the mayor, and the members of city council, should avoid any action which might result in or create the appearance of the following:
(1)
Using public office for private gain.
(2)
Impeding city efficiency or economy.
(3)
Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the city.
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03)
Sec. 2-173. - Definitions.
Whenever used in this code of ethics the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning.

Anything, regardless of its monetary value, which, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence the elected official in the performance or nonperformance of an official action.
