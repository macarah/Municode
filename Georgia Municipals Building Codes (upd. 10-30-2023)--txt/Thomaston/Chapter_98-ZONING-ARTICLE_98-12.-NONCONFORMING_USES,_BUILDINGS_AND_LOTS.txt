ARTICLE 98-12. - NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS AND LOTS

Sec. 98-12.1. - Nonconformance.
A.
Continuation of nonconformance. A use of property or a building lawfully established under a prior ordinance and rendered nonconforming as to the use, or one or more development standards affecting the building, by adoption of this chapter shall be deemed a legal, nonconforming use or building. The intent of this article is to allow certain nonconformities to continue until the nonconforming use ceases or the nonconforming building is removed, but not to encourage continuation or to allow expansion of the nonconformance. Certain allowances may be made to accommodate the development and use of nonconforming lots as identified in article 98-8, exceptions. The following provisions are hereby adopted to prevent undue financial hardship on owners of nonconforming uses and buildings by allowing such uses and buildings to continue subject to the following stipulations:
1.
Where a nonconforming use of a building or lot has ceased for six months or more, the legal nonconforming status of the use shall have been forfeited by the owner. Further use of the building or lot shall be in compliance with the standards of the zoning district in which such building or lot is located.
2.
Loss of legal, nonconforming status of a nonconforming use caused by the conversion of the nonconforming use to a conforming use shall be immediate. The prior nonconforming use shall not be re-established, nor shall another nonconforming use be established.
3.
A nonconforming building shall not be expanded, enlarged or extended in any manner.
4.
A nonconforming use shall not be expanded in any manner to occupy a larger portion of a building that existed on the effective date of this chapter unless the building was clearly designed to accommodate such use.
5.
A nonconforming use of a building may be extended into those interior portions of a building that were clearly designed for such use prior to the effective date of this chapter. No such expansion of a nonconforming use shall occupy any land outside such building.
6.
A nonconforming building shall not be structurally altered, except that repairs necessary to maintain the building in a safe condition in compliance with all building and life safety codes may be made.
7.
A nonconforming building shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired following damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of such damage, as determined by the building official except in conformity with this chapter.
8.
In order to avoid unnecessary hardship, any building or use for which the proper permits were issued prior to the effective date of this chapter and were in compliance with the ordinance and all applicable codes in effect at the time the permits were issued and all other appropriate approvals were granted, such building or use shall be deemed legal nonconforming, provided the use or building or both were completely established within one year of the date such permits were issued and approvals granted.
9.
A nonconforming single family detached dwelling, townhouse or condominium damaged by factors beyond the control of the owner may be rebuilt to the original dimensions despite any nonconformance under this zoning ordinance, provided that the dwelling shall be rebuilt in compliance with all applicable building codes in effect at the time of rebuilding, and provided further that such rebuilding is completed within 12 months from the time such damage occurred.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-12.2. - Illegal nonconforming vs. legal nonconforming status.
A.
In order for a nonconforming use or building to be deemed a legal, nonconforming use or building, assigned so-called "grandfathered" status, establishment of the nonconforming use or construction of the nonconforming building must have been lawful on the date of establishment of the use or completion of construction of the building. The use of a lot or the characteristics of a building that were not previously authorized by issuance of a building permit, certificate of occupancy or an occupation tax permit, as applicable, shall be deemed an illegal use or building.
B.
Any building erected or moved on to a lot without first having an approved building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other approval shall be deemed an illegal building.
C.
All new buildings, lots and uses established following the effective date of this chapter that do not conform to all standards of this chapter or any future amendments shall be deemed illegal.
D.
Any property on which an illegal use or building exists shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this chapter and all other applicable laws. Such properties shall be brought into compliance with all applicable standards of this chapter and other city codes within 90 calendar days of the receipt of written notice by the building official, via certified mail return receipt requested or by hand delivery, or the owner shall be subject to a citation and other enforcement actions as provided in article 98-11, administration, enforcement, penalties and remedies.
E.
Any subdivision created by the recording of a plat or legal description that has not been approved by the city shall be deemed an illegal subdivision. No permit shall be issued for lots created in this manner until approval of the subdivision by the city is secured and a plat of which has been duly recorded.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-12.3. - Re-establishment following abandonment.
A.
Any nonconforming use of a building or lot that is abandoned or the operation of which otherwise ceases for any reason for six months or more shall not be re-established. Any subsequent use of such building or lot shall conform to the applicable standards of this chapter for the zoning district in which such building or lot is located.
B.
Discontinuance of a nonconforming use for six months or more shall constitute evidence of intent to abandon the legal, nonconforming status of a use. For purposes of this section, abandonment shall be determined by the building official based on a finding that any of the following conditions exist:
1.
Failure of the owner to maintain an occupation tax permit, as applicable;
2.
Failure to maintain the full complement of public utilities to the property;
3.
Revocation of a certificate of occupancy for six months or more;
4.
Dilapidation or significant disrepair such as roof deterioration or other condition or deficiency constituting a code violation;
5.
Failure to maintain local, state or federal licenses or other approvals required for active operation of the use; or
6.
Other appropriate evidence as determined by the building official.
C.
The building official shall notify the owner of record of evidence of abandonment in writing via certified mail return receipt requested or by hand delivery.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-12.4. - Nonconforming lots of record.
A.
Any lot of record lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter for which a plat or legal description has been legally recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county prior to the effective date of this chapter and was in compliance with all city zoning regulations at the time of recording, but fails to comply with current lot area or lot width standards for the zoning district in which the lot is located may be developed and used for any of the uses allowed within the zoning district under this chapter, provided the lot is undeveloped and provided further that no development permit shall be issued until the use of a private waste water system has been approved by the county health department. Such lot shall conform to all other applicable standards of this chapter not involving lot area or lot width unless a variance from such standard is approved by the board of zoning appeals. See section 98-8.3, individual lot insufficient as to lot area.
B.
No lot shall be reduced in area, altered in shape, or re-platted in any manner that renders the lot nonconforming as concerns lot area, lot frontage, lot width or depth, yard dimensions or any other standard of this chapter.
C.
No part of a yard, off-street parking or loading space required for any building or use shall be included as part of the yard, off-street parking or loading spaces required for any other building or use unless otherwise provided by this chapter.

Sec. 98-12.6. - Rebuilding of a damaged, nonconforming building.
A nonconforming building damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or any other casualty to an extent less than 50 percent of replacement cost at the time such damage occurred as determined by the building official may be restored and the building or portion of such building that existed at the time of such damage may be repaired provided all repairs have been made and a certificate of occupancy has been issued within 12 months of such damage, subject to all other provisions of this chapter and applicable city codes.

(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-12.7. - Reconstruction of a nonconforming building that has been destroyed.
A nonconforming building destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God or any other casualty to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of replacement cost at the time such destruction occurred as determined by the building official may be rebuilt or replaced in full compliance with all standards of this chapter and other city codes, or shall be demolished at the option of the owner. Rebuilding or replacement shall be accomplished and a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued within 12 months of such destruction. The building official may grant an extension of up to six additional months upon issuing a written finding that the owner has diligently pursued re-construction of the building. The building shall thereafter comply with all standards of this chapter and other city codes.

The building official may grant an extension of up to six additional months upon issuing a written finding that the owner has diligently pursued restoration or re-construction of the dwelling.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)

Sec. 98-12.11. - Exemption due to city, state or county action.
Whenever acquisition of a portion of a lot by the city, county or the state creates a nonconformity, the minimum development standards shall be reduced without the necessity of a variance. Such standards shall include lot frontage, lot area, lot width, lot depth, and building setbacks. Such reduction shall be limited only to the extent that practical development of the property is made possible and upon a written finding by the city manager that such development will not unreasonably impact adjacent properties or uses.

(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-12.12. - Exemption due to death or retirement of the owner.
In order to preserve the investment of a business or property owner, ceasing of operation of a nonconforming use due to the death or retirement of an owner for more than six months shall not constitute abandonment under this article, provided active marketing of the building or premises is evident.
