Sec. 46-44. - Procedure.
(a)
Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(9)) or by at least five residents of the city charging that on any private property in the city there exits an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, or whenever it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any private property in the city is an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, which create a public health hazard or general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any such property is an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions or a general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, the public officer may issue and cause to be served on the owner and any parties in interest (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(7) and (8), a complaint stating the charges in that respect and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(7) and (8)) in such property. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the municipal court of the city, at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the municipal court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing;
(b)
If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the property in question constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety or a general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order, based upon the facts found, describing those conditions which have been determined to be in violation of this division, and specifying a reasonable time within which the violations shall be corrected.
(c)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with any order to correct the specified violations of this division within the time prescribed in such order, the court shall have the authority to order the public officer to correct the violations of this division that exist on the property in question.
(d)
The amount of the cost of correcting the conditions, which exist on such property including all court costs, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically chapter 4 of title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(2)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this code section unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(f)
Review of a court order requiring the correction of violations shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
