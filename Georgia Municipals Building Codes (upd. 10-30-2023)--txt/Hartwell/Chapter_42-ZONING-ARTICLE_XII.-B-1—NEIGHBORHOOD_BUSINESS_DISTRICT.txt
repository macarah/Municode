ARTICLE XII. - B-1—NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT

Sec. 42-338. - Purpose; intent.
The B-1—Neighborhood Business District is intended to provide areas for limited small-scale commercial uses of a convenience nature serving nearby residential neighborhoods as opposed to a regional market. The district is not intended to accommodate automotive or other types of more intensive commercial activities that are of such magnitude or type that would result in the generation of excessive traffic, noise, odors, pollution, safety hazards or other adverse impacts that would detract from the desirability of adjacent properties for residential use. In general, the neighborhood business district includes offices and retail and service establishments but excludes those highway-oriented, high-traffic-generating uses and those which involve use of chemicals and outside sales, storage or display. Institutionalized residential facilities are considered compatible uses in this district.
