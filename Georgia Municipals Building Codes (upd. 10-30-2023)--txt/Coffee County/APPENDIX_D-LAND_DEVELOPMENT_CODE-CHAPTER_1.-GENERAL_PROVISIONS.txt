1-2. - Findings.
1-2.1. General Public Need.

a.
A single set of administrative procedures for making all land use decisions promotes efficiency, predictability and citizen participation.

All administrative decisions should be supported by a record with written findings to assure accountability and efficient appellate review.
d.
A quick and efficient avenue of appeal should be available for all ministerial and administrative decisions.
e.
Enforcement of development permits and the provisions of this Code should be through procedures that are efficient, effective and consistent with the code enforcement procedure established by state law.

1-5.2. Application of Zoning Regulations.
a.
Height and Density. No building or other structure shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, so as to:
1.
Accommodate or house a greater number of persons or occupy a smaller lot area per person; or

Reduction of Lot Area. No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced so that the lot width or depth, front, side or rear yard, lot area per unit or other requirements of this Code are not maintained.

(2)
Any approved development permit or plan which has not begun its development activity within this two year grace period shall by operation of law lose its validity and shall have no legal effect. Any effort thereafter to develop such previously approved development permit or plan shall not be permitted, and the developer shall be required to reapply for approval of its development permits or plans in conformance with the requirements of this Code.
1-5.4. Zoning in Progress.
a.
Purpose. The "zoning in progress" rule allows the County to make a text or map amendment to this Code, and apply that change to development applications submitted after the declaration has been made of a zoning in progress.
b.
No Permits Issued and Period of Time. During the period of time that the County Commission is considering either a text or map amendment to this Code, no permit(s), license(s), or other development order(s) of any kind shall be issued if issuance would result in the non-conforming or unlawful use of the subject property should the text or map amendment change be enacted by the County Commission (rest period). The maximum freeze period allowed for a zoning in progress shall be three months, except that the County Commission may extend the period of up to an additional period of time acceptable to the Commission for good cause, but not to exceed six months, and if it makes a finding that it is in the public interest to do so.
c.
Notice of Declaration. The declaration of "zoning in progress", and rest period on development orders, permit and licenses shall begin on the earlier of:

Responsibility for interpretation by the Zoning Administrator shall be limited to standards, regulations and requirements of this Code, but shall not be construed to include interpretation of any technical code adopted by reference in this Code, nor be construed as overriding the responsibilities given to any commission, board or official named in other sections or articles of this Code.
1-7.4.2. Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries (District Boundaries). Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the "Zoning Map, Coffee County, Georgia", the following rules shall apply:

Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.

1-11. - Severability.
Should any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or provision of this Code be declared invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the Code as a whole or any part thereof which is not specifically declared to be invalid or unconstitutional.
1-12. - Effective Date.
This Code shall be in full force and effective upon adoption by the County Commission and shall apply to any development for which the first submittal of development plans is received after the effective date of this Code.
