The supporting documentation;
(2)
The Zoning Administrator report and recommendation;

(8)
The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts;
(9)

In certain cases where it is deemed that a proposed zoning district would allow uses that are too intensive to mix compatibly with the surrounding area, the Board of Commissioners may, upon recommendation by the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission, or on its own initiative, apply certain conditions to a rezoning request in order to allow the proposed use while protecting the neighbors from the potential negative effects of the proposed zoning and preserving the purpose and intent of this LDC. Subsequent development and use of the property shall be subject to the conditions approved by the Board of Commissioners.
d.
Such conditions may be adopted as deemed necessary to protect neighboring properties and to lessen any potentially adverse effects of the zoning change, including, but not limited to the following:

h.
Any amendment, which is adopted with conditions, shall be indicated on the Coffee County Zoning Map. The property shall be indicated on the Coffee County Zoning Map with the suffix (c) to indicate that the property has been rezoned with conditions.

10-23. - Administrative Variance.
The Zoning Administrator is hereby granted the power and authority to vary the Land Development Code for the County, only as provided in this section. Generally, this procedure is to provide for an efficient and effective review and approval process for certain minor aspects of development in the County. Pursuant to the following, the Zoning Administrator may review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny:
a.
Yard Setbacks. Any yard setback variance request which does not exceed 110 percent of the code requirement (for example: where a rear yard setback is 15 feet and the variance request does not exceed 1.5 feet of relief for a reduction to a 13.5 foot setback).
b.
Fences, Walls and Hedges. Any variance request for a fence, wall or hedge height or location, or other buffer screening matter.

Other Minor Code Variances and Minor Site Plan Amendments.

(4)
Where the scope and intent of any variance approved by the Board of Appeals, or scope and intent of any site plan previously approved by the County Commission is not violated.
d.
County Commission Intent. By adopting this section, the County Commission intends that the Zoning Administrator shall use the provisions of this chapter of this Code as a guide. Because the nature of the variances permitted are minor, the strict adherence to the hardship requirements shall not pertain to a variance granted by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall be free to use reasonableness, as well as an awareness of community needs and aesthetics as a basis for all decisions.
