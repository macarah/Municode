Sec. 2-576. - Purpose.

(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the Charter.

a.
Is perceived or intended by either the one who offers it or the one to whom it is offered, to be sufficient in value to influence a member of the mayor and council in the performance or nonperformance of an official action; or

Under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence a member of the mayor and council in the performance or nonperformance of an official action.

The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council.
(3)
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city council or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the council, board, or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
