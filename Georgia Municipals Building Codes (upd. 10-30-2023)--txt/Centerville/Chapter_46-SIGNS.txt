Sec. 46-2. - Findings, purpose, and intent.
(a)
Findings of fact. The mayor and council find that:
(1)
Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law, however, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public.
(2)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic.
(3)
Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment.
(4)
Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business.
(5)
Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech are reasonably promoted in the city by the provisions of this chapter.
(6)
Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. Holiday decorations such as strings of light are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter.
(b)
Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this chapter is:
(1)
To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community;
(2)
To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment;
(3)
To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions;
(4)
To maintain the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public;
(5)
To protect the area of the city designated for a centralized mixed-use pedestrian friendly downtown area from incompatible signage;
(6)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the city by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the city is charged by law and the state constitution with preserving and protecting;
(7)
To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations while supporting the policies contained in the comprehensive plan pertaining to signage.
(Code 1992, app. A, § 97-1; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.1, 8-18-2009)
Sec. 46-3. - Computation of sign area.
(a)
Generally. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other regulations of the city and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(b)
Area of multifaced signs. The sign area of signs with more than one sign face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces are parallel, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of the larger of the two faces.
(c)
Area of monument signs. The computation of the sign area of a monument sign shall include the entire monument structure, as measured from the top to ground and side to side, upon which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements occur.
(Code 1992, app. A, § 97-3; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.3, 8-18-2009)

(g)
The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete, or contain any materially false statements. Violation of any provision of this chapter will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of the chapter, the enforcement officer shall revoke the permit. Should the enforcement officer deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before 30 calendar days after the city received the completed application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 calendar days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of on the date of original submission.

(h)
An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the board of appeals, provided such appellant files a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the building inspector's notice.

Appeal notices received within seven days of a scheduled board of appeals meeting shall be heard at the next meeting more than seven days following receipt of appeal. The board of appeals shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 days following the close of the appeal hearing.

Sec. 46-14. - Inspections.
The enforcement officer shall periodically inspect each permanent and temporary conforming and nonconforming sign in an attempt to ascertain whether the same is secure or insecure, and whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or in need of repair.

(Code 1992, app. A, § 97-14; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.14, 8-18-2009)
Sec. 46-15. - Removal procedure.
(a)
The enforcement officer shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this chapter. The enforcement officer shall prepare a written notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within 30 days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
All notices mailed by the enforcement officer shall be sent by certified mail and first class mail. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail, or if the first class mail is not returned, after three days of mailing.
(c)
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign and the occupant of the property. If any of such persons is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
(d)
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the enforcement officer ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after receipt of notice.
(e)
Notwithstanding the above, in cases of emergency, the enforcement officer may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice.
(f)
Any sign removed by the enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
(g)
When it is determined by the enforcement officer that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the enforcement officer shall document the imminent danger and attempts to contact the sign owner, and may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner.
(h)
If it shall be necessary for the enforcement officer to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, he may sell the same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.
