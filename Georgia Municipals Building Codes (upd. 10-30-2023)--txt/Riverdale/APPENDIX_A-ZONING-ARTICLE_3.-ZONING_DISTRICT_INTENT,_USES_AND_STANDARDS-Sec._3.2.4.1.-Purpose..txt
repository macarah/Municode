Sec. 3.2.4.1. - Purpose.
The general commercial district is to acknowledge the auto-dependent character of the historic development pattern along Riverdale's arterials such as Highway 85 and Highway 138. This district protects the substantial investments made by the owners of such properties and the contribution of these businesses to Riverdale coffers. Application of the North American Standard Industry Classification (NASIC) uses to these commercial corridors and the interpretive authority of the community development director established in section 9.2, Interpretive authority of the community development director or the zoning administrator affords substantial flexibility in the range of allowed uses. This flexibility will enable business owners to better tap into the market demand represented by the very significant traffic volumes on these corridors.
