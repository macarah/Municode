(3)
It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state and local rules and regulations concerning licenses which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with a copy of their state license before receiving a permit for work to be performed.
(e)
Conditions of permit.
(1)
A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the community development department from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 days each, may be granted by the building official. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions, if granted, shall be in writing.
(2)
Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the city, are hazardous or complex, the community development department shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and, upon completion, make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official.

That granting the appeal requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures or service system;
(4)
That the appeal granted is the minimum that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system;
(5)
That the grant of the appeal will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare;
(6)
In granting the appeal, the mayor/council may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the mayor/council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes. Violation of the conditions of an appeal shall be deemed a violation of the codes.

( Ord. No. 03-2014, § 1(Exh. A), 5-28-14 )
Sec. 18-121. - Findings and intent.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety.
(1)
The governing authority finds that within the city limits, there are buildings and structures that are vacant and pose a danger to the citizens of the city. Vacant structures are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire, accidents, looting and other unsafe activities that are injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. In addition, they can attract and/or cause blight and other harmful effects to surrounding properties.
(2)
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners.
(3)
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
(4)
Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article.
(5)
This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Municipal Code of Riverdale, Georgia.
