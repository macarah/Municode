Purpose and intent.

Accordingly, certain business uses that are clearly incidental to the primary use of residential property may be conducted in any residential zoning district. Such "home occupations" are assigned specific standards to ensure the use will not be a detriment to the residential character and appeal of the surrounding neighborhood. These standards recognize that a variety of home occupations can be conducted with little or no effect on the neighborhood and may be allowed as a special use provided such home occupations comply with the following standards:
1.
The use is clearly incidental to the primary use of the premises as a residence;
2.
The use is conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal operator;
3.
The use is compatible with residential uses;

The use is limited in scope and does not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood; and
