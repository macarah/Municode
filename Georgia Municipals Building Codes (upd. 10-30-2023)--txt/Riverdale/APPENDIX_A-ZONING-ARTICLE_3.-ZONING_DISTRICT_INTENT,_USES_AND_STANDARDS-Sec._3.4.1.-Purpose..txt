Sec. 3.4.1. - Purpose.
The intent of city council in adopting the M light industrial district is to: (1) acknowledge the presence of light industrial uses, (2) limit future such development to appropriate areas which will minimize truck and passenger vehicle conflicts and any adverse impacts on Riverdale's office, institutional and residential developments, (3) narrow the range of allowed industrial uses restricting future such uses to warehousing and wholesale trade, and (4) promote industrial operations that are "clean" and feature a significant office component.
