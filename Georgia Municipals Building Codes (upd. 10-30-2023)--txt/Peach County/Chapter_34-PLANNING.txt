Editor's note— Res. of 5-14-2013, §§ 1—7, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Div. 2, §§ 34-11—34-17, was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 34-11. - Title.
This division shall be entitled "Peach County Roads Standards." Contained herein are the minimum standards believed necessary by the Peach County Board of Commissioners to assure the construction of public roads are designed and constructed in accordance with acceptable engineering standards and that a healthy and safe environment is created in Peach County. Also contained herein is a list of unpaved roads (Exhibit No. 1) that Peach County presently maintains and will continue to maintain.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 1)
Sec. 34-12. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to provide uniform criteria and standards to be followed in the construction of public roads within Peach County, and to identify those unpaved roads now maintained by Peach County. The standards contained herein are not intended to replace or be a substitute for knowledge, experience, or judgment, but are to be considered minimum engineering and construction standards necessary for the construction of public roads. The Peach County Board of Commissioners will not accept roads constructed to lesser standards, but may, upon evidence of special circumstances, grant variances to these standards if the health, safety, and welfare of the public will not be endangered by such variances.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 2)
Sec. 34-13. - County road development.
New roads are added to the Peach County road system by resolution passed by the Peach County Board of Commissioners. Sources of the roads are: additions, realignments, relinquished state or federal highways, or other development. Normally, before a new road becomes part of the Peach County road system, it passes through six steps: planning, design, right-of-way acquisition or dedication, construction, inspection, and acceptance.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 3)
Sec. 34-14. - Design criteria.
Plans and specifications are to be prepared based on appropriate planning and applicable planning criteria standards and requirements. All road design not associated with subdivision designs shall be designed in accordance with requirements of articles "XIV Design Standards" and "XV Required Subdivision Improvements" of the Peach County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution, and plans of such roads prepared by a licensed Georgia professional engineer. Subdivision roads shall be designed in accordance with the Peach County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution. Any road construction requiring [a] disturbed area of one acre or more or the addition of 5,000 square feet of impervious area must meet the requirements of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Peach County Stormwater Design Manual, Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission erosion control requirements, and approval of erosion, pollution, and sediment control plans, and Georgia NPDES permit requirements.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 4)
Sec. 34-15. - Construction criteria.
All construction shall conform to the minimum requirements detailed in articles "XIV Design Standards" and "XV Required Subdivision Improvements" of the Peach County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 5)
Sec. 34-16. - Administration.
(a)
All road plans are to be completed in sufficient detail to facilitate review and are to be submitted to the county/Peach County Board of Commissioners or the board's designee for review and approval. Approval of plans shall remain in effect for one year. However, after one year, if the project is not substantially complete, the owner must submit a request for an extension and modify the existing plan to meet any changes in requirements as set forth in the Code, and resubmit the plan to the county/Peach County Board of Commissioners or the board's designee for review and approval.
(b)
During the construction, the public works director shall from time to time make field inspections. After completion of all the construction and installation of the required public improvements, and if the said work has met the specifications as described herein as determined by the public works director, [the] Peach County Board of Commissioners shall notify the owner in writing of the approval of said work.
(c)
The owner shall petition the board of commissioners to officially accept the completed work on the construction and installation of required public improvements not less than one year from the date of the written approval by the county. It is the owner's responsibility to have all plats and deeds required for acceptance and dedication produced and recorded in the Peach County Superior Court.
(d)
Nothing contained herein shall require the Peach County Board of Commissioners to accept as a public road any private improved or paved road even though such improvement may conform with the standards contained in the Peach County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution.
(Res. of 5-14-2013, § 6)
Sec. 34-17. - Existing unpaved roads.
The list of roads listed in Exhibit 1 are unpaved public roads presently maintained by Peach County. Peach County will continue to maintain these unpaved roads within the lengths and widths maintained at the date of the passage of this resolution [May 14, 2013] as listed in Exhibit 1.
