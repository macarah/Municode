ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 86-1—86-25. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - URBAN FOREST BEAUTIFICATION AND CONSERVATION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 86-26. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "Urban Forest Beautification and Conservation Ordinance of the City of Statesboro, Georgia."
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11)
Sec. 86-27. - Jurisdiction.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all lands within the city.
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11)
Sec. 86-28. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to:
(1)
Protect the aesthetic quality provided by the natural tree cover on tracts of land being converted to urban development.
(2)
Protect and enhance the aesthetic quality provided by street and park trees.
(3)
Prevent soil erosion.
(4)
Prevent reductions in the drainage holding capacity of land.
(5)
Prevent increases and promote reductions in air pollution and carbon dioxide levels in the air.
(6)
Consistent with the expressed purpose of this article, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. It is also the intent of this article that all applicable sites within the city maintain or obtain a 35 percent minimum tree canopy, as defined and explained herein.
(b)
Minimum canopy requirements.
(1)
A basic condition of the Urban Forest Beautification and Conservation Ordinance of the City of Statesboro is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree canopy of 35 percent. Applicable sites except those exempted under section 86-29 of this chapter, for this section, include but are not limited to:
a.
Parks and public grounds;
b.
Any activity requiring issuance of a land disturbance permit is carried out;
c.
Commercial development;
The canopy requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development or disturbance of the applicable site. The canopy may be achieved by preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this chapter or by a combination of the two. Minimum tree canopy shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix 1 to this chapter. Any existing tree (acceptable species) of four inches or greater DBH left in good growing condition on the property is eligible to be counted toward the minimum required canopy. If a preserved tree is counted towards the required tree canopy it must be properly protected. The property owner shall be subject to the minimum tree canopy requirement set forth in this section. The property owner shall base the canopy calculation on the gross site area.
(2)
Trees replanted to achieve canopy requirements are to be selected species from the City of Statesboro, Tree Species Selection List set forth in Appendix 6 (which will list values of canopy coverage in square feet for various groups of trees and minimum area for planting), on file with the city. In addition, replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Canopy credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability.
(c)
Canopy recovery plan.
(1)
Development plans shall include a canopy recovery plan for replacement of trees and vegetation approved for removal. A canopy recovery plan shall include the following:
a.
Areas to be cleared and areas preserved;
b.
The number of trees required for replacement, to achieve 35% canopy coverage.
(2)
In order to promote diversity, no more than 25 percent of the replacement trees shall be of the same species;
(3)
Where the city representative determines that a site cannot sustainably support the required replacement, due to the size and shape and/or structures and/or other viable site constraints, a fee shall be paid to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank. This fee shall be the actual and verified cost of the required tree replacement and shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy; and
(4)
If a property owner has preserved extensive overstory trees and clusters of native trees and vegetation, in such a manner as to provide extensive shading within the built environment, value shall be 100 percent of the drip line area of groupings, excluding wetlands. An exhibit depicting the aforementioned shall be submitted that calculates the canopy spread based on DBH and species of a tree.
(d)
Alternative compliance to canopy density requirement.
(1)
One of the intentions of this chapter is to ensure that a minimum canopy density of trees is maintained on all applicable sites, as defined in this chapter. If this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees (determined by the city's representative and confirmed by the city's tree board), contributing to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank may be an acceptable method of compliance.
(2)
The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods. The city representative must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 60 percent of the required site canopy be met through alternative compliance. The site in question must be planted with as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive.
(3)
No development approval (as defined by this ordinance), land disturbance permit, or building permit shall be issued until the city representative has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds for the alternative compliance method.
(4)
As a method of alternative compliance, the City of Statesboro will accept donations to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the City of Statesboro. For calculating contributions to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank, see Appendix 2 of this chapter.
(5)
The City of Statesboro Tree Bank will be administered by the designated City representative. An annual report shall be submitted to the City of Statesboro City Manager showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted.
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11)

(Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11)
Sec. 86-62. - Greenspace design principles and standards.
The following principles and standards shall apply to the greenspace on a site to be developed:
(1)
Greenspace. A minimum of 15 percent of the total area of any development, including all buildable areas, shall be devoted to greenspace; i.e., for every one acre in the total area of the development fifteen-hundredths acre (6,534 square feet) shall be reserved as greenspace.
a.
The 15 percent minimum greenspace requirement is calculated from the total area of the development.
b.
Required buffers: Existing trees in required buffer zones can be counted in the total calculations of tree canopy required for the development.
c.
Out parcel development is subject to all requirements contained in this article and shall not be permitted without prior approval.
(2)
Tree density. Each greenspace shall have a tree canopy density of at least 15,246 square feet of canopy for every 43,560 square feet of greenspace (35 percent).
(3)
Canopy area requirement. The total canopy area requirement (CARs) required may consist of a combination of canopy area for preserved trees and planted trees.
(4)
Paved surfaces. If the total of all paved surface areas in the development is 10,000 square feet or greater, then a minimum of 15 percent of the paved surface area must be in greenspace.
a.
The greenspace within paved surface areas must be distributed in islands or peninsulas within and throughout the paved surface areas. Tree islands and peninsulas shall be placed no more than ten consecutive parking spaces apart.
b.
This paved area must have a tree density of at least 50 percent tree canopy.
c.
The canopy area requirements within the paved surface areas shall count towards the canopy area requirements for the total area of the development.
(5)
Trees in poor condition. Trees in poor condition are not eligible for canopy area requirements. A tree shall be determined to be in poor condition upon evaluation by the tree board and/or the city engineering department using guidelines set forth in the Best Management Practices Manual resource material, which is incorporated in this article and which is available in the office of the city engineering department and city tree manager.
(6)
Canopy area requirement for preserved trees. The canopy area requirement for a preserved tree is calculated by measuring canopy coverage of all trees saved. Preserved trees may only count for up to 60 percent of minimum canopy area requirement. Unacceptable species or trees (acceptable species) less than four inches will not be assigned canopy coverage area.
(7)
Canopy area requirement for planted trees. The canopy area requirements for a planted tree are assigned based upon mature tree size. Refer to Table No. 1, for the canopy area requirement assigned to each category of planted tree, and to the land clearing and tree protection manual for further information. No one species shall make up over 25 percent of the total number of trees planted.
Table No. 1
EXPAND
Mature Size
(in feet) Canopy area in square feet
Small Canopy Trees (Less than 25) 250
Medium Canopy Trees (30—50) 550
Large Canopy Trees (50 and larger) 1,500
  (8)
Unacceptable species. Unacceptable species as listed in the tree species guidelines incorporated in this article will not be assigned canopy area requirement. Reference shall be made to the tree species list Appendix 7.
(9)
Minimum caliper. The minimum caliper (measured at six inches above the ground) for planted trees is two inches. Multi-stemmed trees must have three to four stems and be six to eight feet tall. Refer to the tree species list located in the manual for information on the mature size of a specific species.
(10)
Protection of preserved or planted trees. All preserved and/or planted trees shall be protected from land disturbance resulting from any building or facility construction.
(11)
Maintenance of minimum tree canopy requirements. The required minimum tree canopy requirements must be maintained on the site as living trees for the life of the development.
(Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11)
Sec. 86-63. - Tree protection and tree establishment.
(a)
Protection of preserved trees. Tree protection zones shall be established and maintained for all preserved trees. The following provisions apply to such zones and trees within them:
(1)
A tree protection plan shall accompany all applications identifying how existing trees within tree protection zones are to be protected during clearing and construction of the project. Such plan shall be approved by the city engineering department when it is determined that the plan adequately addresses the criteria set forth in the Best Management Practices Manual. The tree protection plan may be either a separate plan or included as part of the greenspace plan. This plan will be reviewed by the city engineering or his designee. For projects four acres or more, this plan shall be developed by either a landscape architect, certified arborist or a horticulturist.
(2)
Standards for protected tree preservation in preparation of building plans and during development, demolition, and construction.
a.
Before plans are submitted for permit, the city engineering department or designee is to be consulted before any permanent structure or impervious paving is constructed within the tree protection area.
1.
A tree protection barrier plan shall be provided illustrating how trees located on or adjacent to the subject property will be protected from any adverse effects of proposed construction or grade changes. The plan must include the tree protection barrier that will be installed.
2.
If a major root of any protected tree affected by a grade change visibly extends beyond its drip line, then city engineering department or designee may require additional root protection.
3.
Prior to demolition and/or construction, a tree protection barrier shall be placed and maintained as necessary to prevent damaging protected trees on, or adjacent to the subject property. Shield Critical Tree Protection Zone: Active protective barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical tree protection zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, and otherwise designated tree save areas, prior to any land disturbances. The tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy dripline of the tree(s). Refer to Appendix 3—Critical Root Zone.
4.
Tree protection barriers are to be placed at or beyond the tree's drip line whenever possible. At no time shall the tree protection barrier(s) be closer than ten feet from a trunk unless existing or proposed structures are within that range. Refer to Appendix 4—Tree Protection.
(3)
No vehicles shall be parked, construction material stored or substances poured or disposed of or placed, within any tree protection zone at any time during clearing or construction of the project.

APPENDIX 1. - SQUARE FOOTAGE EXAMPLES
Example 1: Following site to be developed:
Step 1: 10 acre site = 435,600 square feet.
Step 2: 35 percent canopy cover figure.
435,600 × 0.35 = 152,460 square feet to meet 35 percent canopy cover.
Step 3: Preserved trees left on site = 65,340 square feet (1.5 acres).
152,460 minus 65,340 = 87,120 square feet of replacement trees.
Step
4: Replacement trees required to meet 35 percent CR (canopy area requirement).
CR = Canopy area requirement.
⇒ 87,120 square feet of area to be planted in trees.
a.
Overstory trees = 1,500 square feet/tree planted.
✓
48 overstory (large canopy trees) × 1,500 square feet= 72,000 square feet.
✓
24 overstory (medium canopy trees) × 550 square feet = 13,200 square feet.
✓
Total square feet = 85,200 square feet.
b.
Understory trees = 250 square feet/tree planted.
✓
12 understory (small canopy trees) × 250 square feet = 3,000 square feet.
c.
Total square footage of trees planted: 88,200 square feet.
THE 88,200 SQUARE FEET OF PLANTED TREES HAS MET 35 PERCENT CANOPY AREA REQUIREMENT
and
THE PRESERVED TREE AREA (65,340 square feet) DOES NOT EXCEED 60 PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM CANOPY AREA REQUIRED (152,450 square feet).
(Ord. No. 2011-13, App. 1, 12-6-11)
APPENDIX 2. - CITY OF STATESBORO TREE BANK FORMULA FOR DETERMINING CONTRIBUTIONS
Contribution calculations are based on two-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated annually, and on file with the city, representing the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the City of Statesboro area.
Example: Based on unit value of tree replacement of $500.00 (amount subject to change).
To determine the appropriate canopy requirement (CR) contribution, first calculate the implantable square footage (ISF) of tree space which cannot be planted on the site.
Divide the ISF by 1,500 square feet (the square foot value of a two-inch caliper overstory replacement tree) and multiply by $500.00.
Example 2: The total square feet of 35 percent CR required is 43,560 square feet.
Due to space limitation and other site problems, the site only has 29,000 square feet of plantable area (PA) for replacement trees.
To determine the CR trees not plant able on site use the following formula:
ISF = CR - PA
In this example:
CR (43,560 square feet) - PA (29,000 square feet) = 14,560 square feet of ISF.
CR = ISF ÷ 1,500 square feet.
CR = 14,560 ÷ 1,500 square feet = 9.707 replacement trees.
This means the developer must contribute to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank the value of ten trees.
Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows:
10 × $500.00 = $5,000.00 TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO TREE BANK
(Ord. No. 2011-13, App. 2, 12-6-11)
APPENDIX 3. - CITY OF STATESBORO CRITICAL ROOT ZONE (CRZ)
To calculate critical root zone radius, begin by measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH). This is done by measuring the tree's trunk diameter (thickness) at a point 4.5 feet above the ground. The measurement should be done in inches. For each inch of DBH, allow for 1.5 feet of critical root radius for significant or sensitive trees, or 1.0 feet for tolerant trees. For example, if a tree's DBH is 10 inches, then its critical root radius is 15 feet (10 × 1.5 = 15). The PRZ is an area around the tree with a diameter of 30 feet (2 × radius) and is the area in which a critical amount of the tree's roots may be found. Whenever possible, isolate this area from construction disturbance.
Approximate a tree's protected root zone by calculating the critical root radius (crr). First, measure the tree diameter in inches at breast height (DBH). Then multiply that number by 1.5 or 1.0. Express the result in feet.
Example:
dbh = 8 inches
8 × 1.5 = 12
crr = 12 feet
Measure diameter (width) = dbh
