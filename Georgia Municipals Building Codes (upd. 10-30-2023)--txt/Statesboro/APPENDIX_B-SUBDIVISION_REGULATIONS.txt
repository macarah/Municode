ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL

Section 2.1. - Short title, jurisdiction and application.
A.
Municipalities play a vital role in regulating land use within their jurisdictions. Land use is primarily regulated by use of a zoning ordinance and a subdivision regulations ordinance. The zoning ordinance is used to determine the specific uses that can be made of a parcel of land, minimum lot sizes, density per acre, maximum heights of buildings, the use of accessory buildings, the setbacks a building must be from the front, side, and rear property lines, the amount of off-street parking required to accommodate the intended use, signage, fencing and buffering requirements between parcels, regulation of noise, vibration and odors traveling off-site, regulation of solid waste collection systems, and similar matters.
The subdivision regulations ordinance is used to determine the city's standards for new developments within its jurisdiction. Subdivision regulations set out the definition of a subdivision or re-subdivision of property into more than one tract of land, and require the recording of a detailed plat after approval by the city showing the relationship of the proposed development's lots, road system, water system, sewer system, gas system, electric system, cable television system, telecommunications system, stormwater drainage and detention system, and street lighting system to the existing systems. Also included are the minimum standards for extension of these systems that the city will accept as adequate. This includes the size of various pipes, valves, hydrants, road widths, curb and gutter, culverts, and similar standards. This assures our citizens of two primary purposes: that the systems, especially the street system, have been logically extended and connected back to the existing system using sound urban planning techniques, and that the infrastructure that is installed complies with the city's standards.
The city has previously adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, and the mayor and city council have recognized the need to adopt a comprehensive subdivision ordinance so that both primary tools for land use regulation would be in place. The Georgia Constitution at Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 4 authorizes each city and county to adopt plans and exercise the power of zoning. Article 3, Section 6, Paragraph 2(a)(1) and (3) of the Georgia Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to authorize by statute restrictions upon land use. Chapter 70 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia, entitled "Coordinated and Comprehensive Planning by Counties and Municipalities" specifically authorizes and requires cities to develop comprehensive plans and procedures for implementation in accordance with Administrative Rules and Regulations adopted by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. Administrative Rule 110-3-2-.04 Minimum Local Planning Standards, at subsection (3)(c)3(iii) specifically authorizes "...A description of administrative systems, regulatory measures or land development regulations to be adopted or amended over each of the next five years. Land development regulations may include building codes, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, performance standards..." Finally, the City Charter issued by the general assembly at section 4-11 authorizes the mayor and city council "...to promulgate rules, regulations, and ordinances whereby the City of Statesboro, Georgia may be zoned and districted for various uses, and other or different uses prohibited therein, and to regulate the use or uses for which such zones or districts may be set apart, and to promulgate rules, regulations, and ordinances for the development of real estate." Clearly, the State of Georgia by its Constitution, general statutes, administrative rules and regulations, and passage of the Statesboro City Charter has authorized and delegated to the city the authority to implement a subdivision regulations ordinance as part of the state's legislative scheme for comprehensive and coordinated land use planning and development throughout the state.
The regulations set out in this ordinance [this appendix] shall be known and may be cited as "The City of Statesboro, Georgia Subdivision Regulations".
These regulations shall apply to all land located within the boundaries of the City of Statesboro and shall be applicable to all divisions of a tract or parcel of land which meet the definition of "subdivision" herein. For purposes of this ordinance [this appendix], the term "subdivision" means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, buildings, sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development; includes all division of land involving a new public road or a change in existing public roads; includes resubdivision; and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards of the municipality.
(2)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved. However, this exception shall not apply to land being developed for retail commercial purposes, such as a large shopping center or single retail establishment, or an enclosed mall or other group development which may exceed five acres in size. Such developments are considered subdivisions under this ordinance [this appendix].
This definition is identical to that set out in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-150 for use by the Georgia Department of Transportation, except for subsection (2) regarding large commercial developments of more than five acres.
The public health, safety, economy, good order appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly and progressive development of land within the City of Statesboro. In furtherance of the general intent of the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance, the regulation of land subdivision by municipal governing authorities is authorized for the following purposes, among others:
1.
To encourage the development of an economically sound and stable City;
2.
To assure the timely provision of required streets, utilities and other facilities and services to new land developments;
3.
To assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in and through new land developments;
4.
To assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and
5.
To assure, in general, the wise and timely development of new areas, in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the City of Statesboro.
Section 2.2. - Scope.
1.
No person shall divide or subdivide or cause a subdivision to be made, by deed or map, of any parcel of land which is located within the boundaries of the city limits of Statesboro, except in conformity with the provisions of these regulations.
2.
Any owner or developer of any tract of land situated within the City of Statesboro who subdivides the same shall cause a plat of such subdivision, with reference to known or permanent monuments, to be made and recorded in the office of the clerk of court of Bulloch County, Georgia. No such plat of subdivision shall be recorded unless and until it has been approved by the mayor and city council.

ARTICLE 3. - SUBDIVISION PLATTING PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS

Section 3.1. - Procedure for plat approval.
A.
Review steps. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps. These are:
Step 1: Review of the sketch plan;
Step 2: Review and approval of the preliminary plat; and
Step 3: Review and approval of the final plat.
Review of the sketch plan (step 1) and the preliminary plat (step 2) shall be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing utilities or making any other improvements. Review and approval of the final plat (step 3) shall be completed prior to the completion of all proposed site improvements as approved by all city departments. Approval of the final plat shall also take place prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision, unless the required improvements are guaranteed as required by section E [subsection E. below].
B.
Sketch plan review. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plan, the subdivider may submit to the city zoning administrator a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan shall include a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning, and enable him to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The zoning administrator shall review and approve or approve with modifications the sketch plan within 21 days from the date it was received by the city. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted on the returned sketch plan.
C.
Preliminary plat and approval process. Preliminary plat is the plat that developer will use for the construction plans. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, who will coordinate the plan review with the other city departments. The subdivision plat shall be submitted in four copies and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained under [sub]section 3.2.B. Additional copies of the plan and supplemental information may be requested. Each person or agency responsible for reviewing a copy of the preliminary plat shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plan received and return their plan copy to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall compile all comments by the other review officials and return the "redlined" preliminary plat to the subdivider along with all comments that must be addressed in order for the preliminary plat to be approved. The review process of the preliminary plat shall take at the most 21 days. If the preliminary plat needs no further revisions, the zoning administrator shall submit 15 revised copies of the preliminary plat for approval by the planning commission and by the city council. Upon approval by the city council, the mayor shall sign the certificate of preliminary plat, which entitles the developer to start construction. Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final or as-built subdivision plat. Approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute approval of the proposed width and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the city planning and the city engineering departments. Approval of any building and site construction plans shall be granted by the city engineer's office upon the submission of detailed construction drawings and specifications that meet the city ordinances for streets, drainage, utility design or any other applicable ordinances.
Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat, the subdivider may start the construction of the site for the proposed subdivision. The developer shall complete all site work prior to any construction of buildings or houses. This means that all roads, drainage, and utilities have to be completed and approved by the city before houses and buildings can be built. The developer shall arrange periodic inspections of the project by the appropriate city departments during the course of construction. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 12 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require a re-submittal of the preliminary plat to the zoning administrator for approval.
[D]4.
Variance procedure. Any preliminary plat that will require a variance from the city zoning ordinance in order to be approved shall be taken before the city planning commission and the city council for variance approval by the zoning administrator. Upon receiving a preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall have the preliminary plat reviewed by the appropriate city staff for approval for all items; and, the review will include any comments regarding the item that will require a variance from the zoning code [ordinance] in order to be approved. City staff will return all comments to the zoning administrator. Any comments significant in nature will be returned to the subdivider to address prior to the zoning administrator placing the plans in the variance process. Once all comments from the appropriate city staff are addressed, the subdivider submits a variance request for those items that differ from the zoning ordinance. The zoning administrator will place the plans in the variance process following the guidelines stated under Article XVIII entitled "Zoning Board of Appeals" of the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance. The City of Statesboro Planning Commission will then review the subdivision plat with the applicable staff comments and recommend to the city council whether to approve or deny the variance request and the city council will consider the variance request at a formal public hearing to be scheduled by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will note the date on which any variances were granted for the preliminary plat and the date written notification was sent to the subdivider or authorized agent. The variance process usually takes between four to six weeks to complete, once a subdivision plan is placed in the variance process. The zoning administrator shall return the approved or denied preliminary plat to the submitting developer within three working days after final decision is taken by the city council on the variance request.
[E]EF.
Final plat. The final plat may be approved by the planning department in two ways. The developer has a choice to apply for approval of the final plat either when all required improvements are completed, or if he provides an assurance of completion and maintenance of improvements to the City of Statesboro.
Option [No.] 1. Required improvements are completed:
When all required improvements are completed, the final plat shall conform substantially to the approved preliminary plat and if there was substantial deviation from the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall prove these deviations. If desired by the developer, the final plat mayconstitute only that portion or phasing of the preliminary plat he or she is proposing to record and develop at one time. Following approval of the preliminary plat and the completion of all required improvements to city standards, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator an application for final approval. The application shall include the following:
1.
A complete list of deviations, if any, from the approved preliminary plat.
2.
A certified copy of all covenants and restrictions, if any, pertaining to platted subdivision.
3.
A surety bond or maintenance bond for 20 percent of total improvement costs for those facilities to be dedicated and then maintained by the city. This bond insures the maintenance of required public facilities and improvements for one year after completion and approval of said facilities.
4.
A minimum of four prints of the final as-built plat, including any easements and reserved strips,and a copy of an electronic drawing file compatible with AutoCad, as per the city engineering department.
5.
All as-built plans showing the locations of utility lines and service taps.
The planning department and the engineering department shall review and approve a final plat. The mayor and planning director shall sign the certificate of final plat approval. The subdivider then submits the final plat for recording to the Bulloch County Clerk of Court.
All Final plats provided to the city must be of a size acceptable by the Bulloch County Clerk of Court for recording. For large subdivisions, the final plat may be submitted for approval progressively in different phases satisfactory to the zoning administrator. Approval of the final plat shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by the public or the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. Until the city officially accepts the dedication of any streets, parks, or any grounds, it is the developer's responsibility to maintain such facilities. Applicants attempting to dedicate a street or any other facility shall follow the procedure listed under article 8.
The owner or agent of a subdivision shall not transfer title to any lot within the subdivision without the approval and the recording of the final plat.
Option No. 2. Assurance for completion of improvements:
The developer can apply for approval of the final plat if required improvements are partially completed and if he provides the City of Statesboro with assurance for completion of the remaining required improvements. Under this option, the developer must complete the grading of all roads; however he can bond the base and paving of these roads. When this method is chosen, the developer shall consider the following:
[F.]
Improvement and guarantee: Before the planning commission and the city council approve the final plat, all applicants shall be required to complete or provide improvement guarantees (in the form of a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit, as provided in section 9.7) for all remaining construction of roads, utilities, drainage system and other improvements as required.
1.
Improvement guarantees: The subdivider may provide improvement guarantees and deed and easement documents at the time of application for final subdivision approval. The city engineer shall approve the amount of the improvement bond which shall be sufficient to secure to the City of Statesboro the satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. The improvement cost estimate shall be provided by the developer and shall be prepared by a professional engineer. Assurance guarantees shall be structured to permit periodic demands for payment from the issuer in whole or in part for the entire amount of the credit. The improvement guarantee shall not be less than 100 percent of the total cost of required improvements and can be renewed for a period not to exceed one year.
2.
Failure to complete improvements: In those cases where an improvement guarantee has been posted and required improvements have not been installed, the City of Statesboro shall call the improvement guarantees due and collect all funds.
3.
Release or reduction of improvement guarantees: The City of Statesboro will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce improvement guarantees, until all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed.
4.
Maintenance of public improvements: The subdivider shall maintain all required improvements until acceptance of such improvements by the city. Before dedication of improvements, the applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the City of Statesboro in an amount considered adequate by the engineering department. The maintenance bond shall assure the satisfactory condition of streets and other facilities for one year after the date of their approval by the City of Statesboro. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be set at 20 percent of the total costs of required improvements of said facilities. The bond amount will be refunded after one year.
Once the improvement guarantees have been posted, the developer shall apply for the approval of the final plat and follow the same criteria cited in [subsection] F.1. [above]. However, the owner or agent of a subdivision shall not transfer title to any lot within the subdivision without the approval and recording of the final plat.
G.
Sketch plans and preliminary plats not required. Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction or opening of new streets, water, or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets shall be accepted by the zoning administrator in the form of a final plat.

In addition, the city engineering staff may be requested by planning department staff to review the site plan for utility concerns and/or drainage issues. If such standards are met, the survey shall be certified by the signature of the mayor of the city and the planning director. If the planning director determines that the requirements are not met by the proposed division of property, the plat or survey shall not be certified and the reasons shall be stated in writing.
(Ord. of 4-1-03(2), § 2)
ARTICLE 4. - IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED AND DESIGN STANDARDS

Section 4.1. - Required improvements.
The subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by the regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
1.
Natural gas. The city will provide natural gas service to subdivisions where the proximity of the existing system makes it economically feasible. All developers should contact the natural gas department to determine whether the city can provide the service. If so, there will be no cost to the developer for this installation, and potential property owners would be eligible for all customer rebates and incentive programs of the natural gas department. Where gas lines are located within a street right-of-way, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
2.
Water supply. A water system shall be installed in a subdivision. Water mains, valves, and fire hydrants shall be installed according to ordinances and regulations set forth by the City of Statesboro. The water system installed shall be connected to the City of Statesboro water system through tapping into the existing lines. The property developer shall bear all the costs for the installation of this system within the actual subdivision. When the water mains to be installed are allowed to be located in the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to service each lot before the street is surfaced. Illustrations 6 and 8 [see illustrations at the end of this appendix] show water system details applicable in Statesboro.
3.
Sanitary sewerage. A sanitary sewer system shall be installed in a subdivision, unless the city council specifically allows another system. Sanitary sewers shall be designed and installed according to the plans and specifications approved by the City of Statesboro, which are compatible with the city's sanitary sewer system master plan. The sewer system installed shall be connected to the City of Statesboro sewer system through a connection tying onto the existing lines. The property developer shall bear the costs for the installation of this system within the actual subdivision. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. See Illustration 7 [at the end of this appendix] for sewer tap connection. In addition, if non-metallic pipe is used, the end of this connection shall be wrapped with magnetic tape to facilitate its future location.
4.
Utility easement. A 15-foot city utility easement shall be located along each side of the road right-of-way. If these 15-foot easements can not be provided, then a written appeal with justifications can be submitted for approval by the director of the water/sewer department.
5.
Sewerage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewerage disposal system such as an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by the city engineer or his designee and the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. These type facilities would only be considered under extreme cases where it is absolutely not practical to tie onto the city's existing sewer system. Where septic tanks are used, the health department may require larger lots than required under the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance. Since the health department's requirements are for conformance with health standards, the prescribed lot size for such uses shall be the minimum size used in the development.
6.
Curb and gutters. If used, concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications of the city. Approval of the subdivider's plans by the city engineering department is required. Curb requirements shall vary depending on the functional classification of each street, (local, collector, arterial), the location and the traffic volume. Curbing may also be required as follows:
a.
For storm water management;
b.
To stabilize pavement edge;
c.
To delineate parking areas;
d.
Ten feet on each side of drainage inlets;
e.
At intersections;
f.
At corners; and
g.
At tight radii.
Curbing shall be designed to provide a ramp for bicycles and/or wheelchairs as required by state law and according to the ADA requirements. The standard curb section used shall be 20 feet in length with a construction joint, 18 inches, 24 inches, or 30 inches wide including a roll curb and gutter. Residential curb and gutter shall have a minimum gutter thickness of 6 inches and commercial curb and gutter shall have a gutter thickness of 8 inches or thicker depending on it's location, soil conditions and traffic load. All concrete used for curbs shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Georgia Department of Transportation State of Georgia Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges. Curb and gutter shall be constructed with Portland cement concrete having a compressive strength of equal or greater than 3,000 psi.
Curbs and /or combination curbs and gutters shall be constructed of Class B concrete. Asphalt curb and gutter will not be acceptable within publicly maintained R/W. Curb and/or gutter shall be constructed prior to the construction of the pavement. Where drainage inlets are constructed, but curbs are not required, curbing must be provided at least ten feet on each side of the inlet, set back one foot from the extension of the pavement edge. For more information on types of curbs, refer to the Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Street, AASHTO, 1990 edition.
7.
Shoulders.
a.
Shoulders are required on all roads.
[b.]b.c.
Shoulders shall measure four feet in width, or as required by designing engineer, on each side for all streets and shall be located within the right-of-way as shown in Illustrations 4 and 5 [see illustrations at the end of this appendix]. The width of swales shall be determined by site-specific conditions.
c.
Graded shoulder shall be stabilized turf or other material acceptable to the city engineer.
8.
Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation and surfacing of local streets shall be carried out by the subdivider according to this ordinance [this appendix].

The type of soil encountered will be considered in selecting the proper slope. Side slopes flatter than 3:1 may be required if soil conditions warrant.
(6)
Drainage design standards, methodology and criteria. All drainage design and analysis shall be based on the city's drainage control ordinance.
Exemption: If the proposed subdivision encompasses less than 4.5 acres and the total combined impervious areas of all streets, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas and curb and gutter are less than one-half acres, then on-site detention is not required.
Note: The developer is responsible for verifying that immediate off-site drainage systems (i.e., storm sewers, culverts, ditches, detention areas) are adequately sized to accept the storm water run-off from the proposed development. The developer will be required to upgrade said pipes or ditches if found necessary by the city engineer.
(A)
Methodology. Two hydrological methods for computing surface runoff are hereby adopted: "The Rational Method" and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Technical Release No. 55 FR-55; entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" or any other method recognized by engineering standards.
(B)
Drainage design criteria. The following design criteria shall be used for either methodology utilized for computation:
Design storm—Culverts crossing beneath public roadways (in subdivisions) must be designed to pass at least the 25-year frequency[,] 24-hour storm. All other storms water piping, except that associated with a detention pond outlet, shall be designed to pass at least the 10-year frequency 24-hour storm. The city recommends the oversizing of stormwater piping.
(C)
General requirements.

9.
Major drainage canals shall not be used for storage.
10.
Use of rectangular weir outlets will be allowed only where the weir will provide better outlet control needed for a given situation than that provided by a V-notched weir. V-shaped of V-notched weir outlets are recommended to achieve detention storage. Use of innovative outlet structures such as pipe-culvert combinations, perforated riser pipes, or specially graduated opening outlet control boxes, are encouraged as ways of reproducing pre-development runoff conditions. Whichever restrictive outlet devise is chosen, it should be designed to reduce clogging.
11.
Design data for storage volume and detention outlet requirements shall be submitted and approved by the city engineer.
12.
Detention and retention ponds shall be designed for ten-year sediment load before the one-foot storage volume requirement is included.

Such approval by the city does not obviate the need for state or federal agency approval where applicable.
(D)
Direct storm water discharge.
(1)
Discharges to natural water bodies. Where a specific site requires a permit to allow direct discharge into a natural water body, methods of diffusing and filtering the discharge and of reducing velocity may be required.
(2)
Final landscape design and planting shall not work against the storm water runoff controls and drainage concepts approved as part of the construction plan approval process.
(3)
Rip rap. Sufficient rip rap shall be provided anywhere that soil scouring will occur because of excessive runoff velocities. Other energy dissipation will be considered.
(E)
Drainage easements. All drainage easements offered to the city for dedication to public use shall have a minimum width of 25 feet or as shown in table below (section F). For underground storm drain pipes, the minimum width of the easement shall not be less than 25 feet. The applicant shall submit to the city engineer a request for permanent dedication of drainage systems for city maintenance. (See Exhibit 5 [attached to the subdivison regulations of the city adopted Jan. 4, 2002].) The city engineer shall certify that all as-built improvements so offered are in conformance with approved plans and with all prevailing city standards.
