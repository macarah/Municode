  C.
Stacking. For any use with a drive-up facility that requires vehicles to wait for merchandise or service, such as a restaurant, a vehicular stacking area shall be provided with sufficient area for a minimum of four vehicles to park in line behind one vehicle stopped at the facility's first stopping point. The stacking area shall be provided entirely on the property and shall be designed so it does not prohibit vehicles from entering or exiting parking spaces or the lot itself and it shall not be within a required drive aisle.
D.
Islands. Parking facilities that are part of a commercial development requiring 50 or more spaces shall include landscape islands at the rate of one landscape for every 50 required spaces. Islands may be landscaped and counted towards requirements of chapter 86, division 2, section 86-62 of the Statesboro Code of Ordinances.
E.
Shared and joint parking facilities.
1.
Shared parking between day and night users. One-half of the offstreet parking spaces required by a use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be shared with a use that will be closed at night or on Sundays.
2.
Joint parking. Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to all uses collectively and not appear to be serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building.
3.
Shared parking agreements. Joint or shared parking arrangements involving two or more parcels must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the director of planning/community development and approved by the owners of each of the affected properties or uses. A copy of the agreement shall be filed for record with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Bulloch County.
4.
Shared parking for multiple or mixed uses. The zoning administrator may approve a reduction of up to 20 percent in the number of parking spaces required for a specific use where inter-parcel access is provided and a shared parking arrangement demonstrates that adequate parking will be provided for the affected uses.
F.
Surfacing material.
1.
All parking lots and loading areas shall be paved with concrete, asphalt, concrete/brick pavers or similar "all weather" surface materials approved by the city engineer.
2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following may utilize contained alternative surfacing material to include, but not limited to, porous asphalt, turf, gravel, wood, mulch and cobble for spaces other than areas dedicated for disability access:
a.
Minimum parking, pursuant to section 1600, of five spaces or less;
b.
Parking reserved exclusively for employees or company vehicles (provided in addition to minimum required spaces for customers);
c.
Parks, playgrounds, fields used for organized sports, fairgrounds, and other similar uses;
d.
Overflow parking areas for religious facilities, flea markets, produce stand or uses similar in nature;
e.
Other uses as approved by administrative variance.
3.
An administrative variance may be granted from the paving, marking, and or curb/gutter requirements of this provision if negative impact to the environment would occur, or, if the provision of alternative surface materials, curbing, or access control would be more compatible with the character of the area or more suitable for environmental, drainage, storm water, or other relevant considerations. Administrative relief may be granted from this provision upon a showing of facts substantiating the requested relief, rather than upon a showing of hardship.
G.
Proper grading to eliminate sheet flow of drainage water onto sidewalks, public rights-of-way, and abutting property shall be designed and constructed. Provisions may be necessary for the on-site collection and storage of drainage water. The effects of sheet flow may be mitigated by the use of pervious surfaces for parking facilities.
H.
Adequate aisles and turn-around areas shall be provided so all vehicles may enter and exit the parking facility in a forward manner.
I.
Clear and permanent markings shall be provided to define individual parking spaces, drive aisles, drive lanes, and intersections in accordance with specifications approved by the city engineer. Markings shall not be required of spaces used exclusively for demonstration of inventory.
J.
Wheel stops shall be provided in all parking facilities that do not already have curbing for all spaces abutting property lines, buildings, and landscaping. No vehicle shall overhang a public right-of-way. They shall be a minimum of four inches in height and width and six feet in length. They shall be firmly attached to the ground and so constructed as to withstand normal wear.
K.
Parking facilities shall be at all times maintained at the owner's expense in a clean, orderly, dust free, and undeteriorated condition and in conformance with the provisions of this section.
[L]J.
Parking facilities must be in conformance with the provisions of this section prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building served by the parking facilities or an occupational tax certificate for a business on the property.
[M]L.
Parking facilities shall be constructed or enlarged and meet all applicable provisions of this article when a new building is constructed, an existing building is enlarged, additional dwelling units are created, or when a use is intensified by the addition of floor space, seating capacity, or change in use.

Section 1602. - Required offstreet loading spaces.
Loading spaces required under this section shall be at least 50 feet long and 12 feet wide. The regulations of this section are not applicable in the CBD district. Every lot used for commercial or industrial purposes and having a building or buildings with a total area of at least 10,000 square feet and every lot used for office or research purposes on which there is a building or buildings having a total floor area of at least 20,000 square feet, shall be provided with an offstreet loading space. An additional offstreet loading space shall be required for lots used for commercial or industrial purposes where the floor area of all buildings exceeds 100,000 square feet.
(Ord. No. 2016-06, §§ 1, 2, 8-2-16)
Section 1603. - Requirements for single-family and two-family residential parking.
For single-family and two-family dwellings within the R-15, R-20, R-30, and R-40 zoning districts, the following restrictions shall apply:
A.
It shall be unlawful for any person to park, place, or allow the parking or placement of an automobile, truck, trailer, motorcycle, all-terrain vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat, or similar item on an unimproved surface within the area between any outside wall of a house and a property line which is also a public right-of-way boundary. If the property abuts more than one public right-of-way, this prohibition shall apply to the area between any outside wall of the house and any property line that is also a public right-of-way boundary.
B.
Vehicles and other items as described above may be parked or placed on an unimproved surface only if located on a part of the property that is not between the house and a property line that is also a public right-of-way boundary and only if parked or placed in an orderly fashion.
C.
The owner of the property must provide an adequate area meeting the provisions above for all vehicles and/or other items used or owned by residents or visitors of the property.
D.
The planning director for the city shall have the authority to waive, in whole or in part, the provisions of subsections A., B., and C. above in the event of a hardship related to physical constraints of the property or health of a resident of the property. The property owner shall be required to provide proof of a hardship sufficient to warrant a waiver.
E.
All vehicles and other items referenced in section 1605.A shall have valid and current license and/or registration as required by the State of Georgia and shall be legally and safely operable as originally designed.
In the event of a conflict between the requirements of this section and any other access control and driveway standards and specifications in use by the city, the most restrictive specifications and requirements shall take precedence.
