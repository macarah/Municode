DIVISION 2. - CAPITAL COST RECOVERY FEE

Sec. 82-72. - Purpose.
The mayor and city council have determined that an effective means of financing the installation of the major trunk water and sewer lines inside and adjacent to the city limits, is to finance the cost using a GEFA loan or revenue bond with a 20-year amortization period, and then to recoup most of the principal cost for said loan from a charge against each parcel or equivalent of such parcel. Said cost shall be determined based upon a detailed engineering study that includes an equitable mechanism for prorating the cost among all of the developable property (which excludes wetlands and road rights-of-way). As the property served by the major water and sewer trunk lines is developed, the fee would be paid into the water and sewer fund.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07)
Sec. 82-73. - Authorization.
The mayor and city council hereby establish a capital cost recovery fee (CCR fee), to be charged in any capital cost recovery fee district created under section 82-74 below.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-74. - Establishment of a CCR fee district by resolution.
The mayor and city council may by resolution establish a CCR fee district, after receiving a detailed engineering study that identifies the sewer drainage basin to be served, and the water system necessary to service that drainage basin. The engineering study must provide a coherent, equitable methodology for apportioning the principal cost of the loan necessary to finance these major water and sewer lines between the various owners of the property, whether used for residential or commercial purposes. The initial costs to be imposed shall be as estimated for construction in the engineering study, and shown on the study's CCR fee district maps.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-75. - Amendment of a CCR fee district by resolution.
The mayor and city council may amend by resolution a CCR fee district whenever in their judgment the area needs to be enlarged or contracted, based upon the area to be served; or, to reflect the actual cost of construction once a major line has been installed. This will assure that the final cost of construction is the number used in computing the actual CCR fee. The estimated costs are for planning purposes, and represent the engineering firm's best estimate of construction costs.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-76. - Property must be within city limits to obtain water or sewer service within a CCR fee district.
No water or sewer service shall be offered or provided to any property or its owner within an established capital cost recovery fee district unless the property to be served has been annexed into the city limits of Statesboro prior to development, and the owner has entered into a water and sewer agreement with the city. This will assure that the city's zoning, subdivision regulations, and development standards are met on each such development, and that it becomes a part of the city.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-77. - Collection.
The CCR fee shall be collected at the time that a building permit is issued for a new development within a defined CCR fee district. The city will not take partial payments of any kind.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-78. - Separation as a source of revenue within the water and sewer fund.
The CCR fee revenue shall be separated in the accounting records so that the amounts collected within a CCR fee district can be tracked on an annual basis. The finance director shall be responsible for setting up the accounting system changes to do this.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-79. - Appropriation.
As long as there is any outstanding debt issued for any portion of a CCR fee District, the revenues generated shall be classified as restricted cash set aside to pay that debt. In the event that sufficient CCR fees are restricted to cover all principal and interest payments on said outstanding debt, any CCR fees collected above that amount may be classified as unrestricted cash, and used for any purpose within the water and sewer fund.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Sec. 82-80. - Duration of a specific CCR fee district.
Any CCR fee district established pursuant to this code shall remain in place until all of the available developable property within said district has been developed, and the required fees have been collected.
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07
Secs. 82-81—82-90. - Reserved.
