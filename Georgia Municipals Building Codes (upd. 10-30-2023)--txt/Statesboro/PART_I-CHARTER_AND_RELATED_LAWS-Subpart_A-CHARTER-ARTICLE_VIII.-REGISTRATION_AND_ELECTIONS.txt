"All and each of us do swear that we will faithfully superintend this day's election; that we will make a just and true return thereof and will not knowingly permit anyone to vote in this election unless we believe that such person is entitled to vote accordingly to the law of the City of Statesboro; nor will we knowingly prohibit anyone from voting who is by law entitled to vote; so help us God"; the oath to be signed by each manager in the capacity in which such person acts.
