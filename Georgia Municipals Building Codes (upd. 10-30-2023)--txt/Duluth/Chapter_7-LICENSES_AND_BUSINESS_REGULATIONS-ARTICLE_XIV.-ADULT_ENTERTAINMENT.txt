Footnotes:
--- (14) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance of October 13, 1997, §§ 1—18, and 20—34, has been treated at the editor's discretion as superseding the provisions of former art. XIV, §§ 7-601, 7-621, 7-622, 7-631—7-634, 7-641—7-647, 7-651, 7-661, 7-671, 7-672, and 7-681—7-684. Former art. XIV pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from ordinances of April 26, 1993; August 14, 1995; and October 9, 1995.
Cross reference— Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited in an establishment dispensing alcoholic beverages, § 3-123; public indecency, § 10-10.

Sec. 7-601. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
