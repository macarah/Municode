Engaging in the business of pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling used or previously owned merchandise, furniture, machinery, appliances, utensils, firearms, gold, silver, coins, precious metals, jewelry, and precious stones within the unincorporated areas of the county is hereby declared to be affected with the public interest due to the opportunity it affords for the disposal of stolen property.
In the public interest and as set forth herein, all pawnbrokers shall maintain records documenting all pawnshop transactions.
(1)
All pawnbrokers shall maintain records documenting accurate descriptions of all property pledged, traded, pawned, exchanged, or sold to the pawnbroker. Such description shall include, to the extent possible, the manufacturer, model, serial number, style, material, kind, color, design, number of stones if jewelry, and all other identifying names, marks, and numbers. The pawnbroker shall assign a pawnshop transaction number documenting each transaction, and ensure each item received is tagged with the pawnshop transaction number.
(2)
The tag bearing the pawnshop transaction number must remain attached to the item until the property is disposed of by sale, trade, or other lawful means. This paragraph does not apply to the purchase of property from licensed wholesale or distributor businesses for the purpose of retail sales; however the pawnbroker shall be required to maintain all purchasing records for property exempted from this paragraph.
(3)
The pawnbroker shall require all persons pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling property to show proper identification prior to conducting a pawnshop transaction. Proper identification is defined as a government issued photo identification card such as a driver's license, military identification card, state identification card, or passport.
(4)
The pawnbroker shall also document the name, address, telephone number, race, sex, height, weight, driver's license number, date of birth, and social security number of the person pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling the property, along with the date and time of transaction. This documentation shall be made at the time of the transaction.
(5)
The pawnbroker shall photograph, with a digital camera or web camera, the person pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling the property. The photograph shall clearly show a frontal view of the subject's face along with the pawnbroker's ticket transaction number and a photograph of the item being pledged, traded, pawned, exchanged, or sold. Digital images shall be labeled and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable and readily available for review.
(6)
The pawnbroker shall obtain from each person pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling any property, the fingerprint of the right hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed. The fingerprint shall be imprinted onto the pawn transaction form in the designated area along with the signature of the person pawning, trading, pledging, exchanging, or selling the property. The fingerprint must be clear and legible. In the event that more than one (1) pawn transaction form is required, a fingerprint and signature should be obtained for each form. Fingerprints and the information required herein shall be obtained each time such person pledges, trades, pawns, exchanges, or sells any property.
(7)
Items of property that appear to be new, unused, and in their original packaging cannot be accepted by the pawnbroker unless the customer can supply a copy of the original sales receipt, or other proof of purchase from the place of purchase, to the pawnbroker who shall retain the receipt or proof of purchase on file.
(8)
The pawnbroker shall store the above records, digital images, and fingerprints for a period of four (4) years and make them available to law enforcement personnel upon request.
(9)
Every pawnshop shall enter each transaction as it occurs into the electronic automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system. The administrator of the electronic automated reporting system will electronically transmit all transactions to the city police department.

Sec. 7-328. - Daily report to police; required format.
Every pawnbroker shall make a daily report, in such form as may be prescribed by the chief of police, of all pawnshop transactions that occurred during 24 hours ending at 9:00 p.m. on the date of the report.
(1)
Daily reports shall list all property pledged, traded, pawned, exchanged, or sold, the pawn transaction number for each transaction, and a description of the property including, to the extent possible, the manufacturer, model, serial number, style, material, kind, color, design, number of stones if jewelry, and any other identifying names, marks, and numbers. The daily report shall also list the name, address, race, sex, height, weight, driver's license number, date of birth, and social security number of the person pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling the property along with the date and time of the transaction.
(2)
Every pawnshop shall enter each transaction as it occurs into the electronic automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system. The administrator of the electronic automated reporting system will electronically transmit all transactions to the police department.
(3)
In the event that the electronic automated reporting system becomes temporarily or permanently disabled, pawnshops and pawnbrokers will be notified as soon as possible by the police department. In this event, the pawnbrokers will be required to make records of transactions in paper form as prescribed by the police department. Such paper forms must include all information as enumerated in 7-327. Pawnbrokers shall be responsible for maintaining an adequate inventory of these forms.
(4)
The chief of police or his designee shall select and designate the required automated reporting system and required equipment needed. There will be a fee assessed to the pawnshop for each reported transaction. Said fee may be assessed against the persons pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling property. The accessed fee shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the actual cost charged by the police department or the third party administrator. This fee will be invoiced to the pawnbroker and collected by the chief of police or his designee, which may be a third party administrator of the automated reporting system.
