Chapter 87 - SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS

Sec. 87-1. - Intent.
new
To provide comprehensive guidelines for the safe and orderly development of solar energy.
(1)
Whereas it is in the best interest of Jones County to facilitate the siting, construction, installation, and decommissioning of solar energy systems (SESs) in Jones County in a manner that encourages local economic development and protects the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Jones County, and at the same time mitigates any adverse impacts to wildlife, agricultural lands, forests, and other natural landscapes; and
(2)
Whereas the intent of Jones County is to increase energy security and diversify the energy portfolio, to promote the use of Georgia-based energy resources, to decrease the cost of energy, to bolster local economic development and employment prospects, to increase consumers' choices in energy consumption, to encourage the use of a renewable energy resource, to support Jones County's sustainability agenda, and to reduce air and water pollution; and
(3)
Whereas the intent of Jones County is not to compromise or contradict the health, safety, or environmental requirements contained in other federal, state, and local laws, nor is it to create heightened standards for the siting, construction, installation, and decommissioning of SESs that would discriminate against SESs relative to other similar commercial, industrial, or utility projects within Jones County;
(4)
Be it ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Jones County as follows.

Sec. 87-2. - Supplemental definitions.
new
Solar energy system (SES) means a device or structural design feature that provides for the collection of solar energy for electricity generation, consumption, or transmission, or for thermal applications. For purposes of the Jones County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution, SES refers only to (1) photovoltaic SESs that convert solar energy directly into electricity through a semiconductor device or (2) solar thermal systems that use collectors to convert the sun's rays into useful forms of energy for water heating, space heating, or space cooling. SES as used in the Jones County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution excludes concentrated solar power, which uses mirrors to focus the energy from the sun to produce electricity.
Integrated solar energy system means an SES where solar materials are incorporated into building materials, such that the two are reasonably indistinguishable, or where solar materials are used in place of traditional building components, such that the SES is structurally an integral part of a house, building, or other structure. An Integrated SES may be incorporated into, among other things, a building facade, skylight, shingles, canopy, light, or parking meter.
Solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the roof of a house, building, or other structure and does not qualify as an Integrated SES.
Mounted solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the ground and does not qualify as an Integrated SES. For purposes of the Jones County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution, any solar canopy that does not qualify as an Integrated SES shall be considered a Ground Mounted SES, regardless of where it is mounted. The Footprint of a Ground Mounted SES is calculated by drawing a perimeter around the outermost SES panels and any equipment necessary for the functioning of the SES, such as transformers and inverters. The Footprint does not include any visual buffer or perimeter fencing. Transmission lines (or portions thereof) required to connect the SES to a utility or consumer outside the SES perimeter shall not be included in calculating the Footprint. Ground Mounted SESs shall be delineated by size as follows:
(a)
Small Scale Ground Mounted Solar Energy System (Small Scale SES) means a Ground Mounted SES with a Footprint of less than one acre.
(b)
Intermediate Scale Ground Mounted Solar Energy System (Intermediate Scale SES) means a Ground Mounted SES with a Footprint of between one and 15 acres.
(c)
Large Scale Ground Mounted Solar Energy System (Large Scale SES) means a Ground Mounted SES with a Footprint of more than 15 acres.

Sec. 87-3. - Applicability.
new
(a)
This chapter applies to the siting, construction, installation, and decommissioning of any new SES to be constructed or installed after October 6, 2020 within the jurisdiction of Jones County.
(b)
Any SES that, prior to October 6, 2020 1) is in operation; 2) is being lawfully sited, constructed, or installed; or 3) has caused the incurrence of substantial liabilities relating to siting, construction, or installation; shall be exempt from complying with this Resolution, unless the surface area of an Integrated SES or Rooftop SES or the Footprint of a Ground Mounted SES is increased by more than 25 percent after October 6, 2020.
(c)
Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, an SES shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including the requirements of the Jones County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution and applicable building, fire, electric, and plumbing codes. If a provision in this chapter directly conflicts with a requirement of any other Jones County requirement, the more stringent of the relevant criteria shall control. Where such conflict is deemed otherwise irreconcilable by zoning enforcement officer, an applicant seeking to install SES may be awarded a variance, pursuant to the criteria for awarding such variances as established in Section 116.
(d)
Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, any SES shall be subject to any design review requirements that may be instituted for the location where the SES is proposed for installation.

a.
For a Ground Mounted SES allowed without a permit, within six months of the beginning of decommissioning, the SES and all structures associated with it shall be removed, all materials shall be recycled or otherwise reused to the extent reasonably practicable, and the property shall be returned to its condition prior to the installation of the SES or to some other condition reasonably appropriate for the designated land use; and
b.
