Section 84. - Buffer and landscape standards for gateway overlay zoning district.
This section enacts a new article to provide guidance in the management of development along the major highways entering Jones County, which are U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, Georgia Route 18, Georgia Route 49, Georgia Route 57, and the proposed Gray Bypass; and shall apply to all properties bordering these highway corridors. These are the major highways through Jones County, which are traveled daily by many people and are home to numerous businesses and residents, thus making these highway corridors the major gateways to Jones County with much value to the community, both economically and aesthetically.
The purpose of this section is to set standards for development of property fronting these highway corridors, including the establishment of buffers and the preservation and establishment of landscaping and trees as a part of all land-disturbing activities in order to safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, to enhance and protect property values, and to make Jones County a more attractive place to live, visit, and conduct business.
Buffer areas visibly separate one use from another through screening and distance; shield and block noise, light, glare or visual or other conditions; block physical passage to nonsimilar areas; and reduce air pollution, dust, dirt, and litter.
Trees, woodland areas, and landscape strips act as buffers against noise, wind and sun; filter out pollutants; assist in stabilizing the soil; reduce erosion and stormwater runoff; improve water quality; enhance wildlife; and increase the aesthetic, social, and property values of the community.
Thus, the board of commissioners of Jones County hereby finds that requirements for buffers, the planting of new trees and other landscape material, the protection and preservation of trees as part of the land development process along the gateway highways U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, Georgia Route 18, Georgia Route 49, Georgia Route 57, and the proposed Gray Bypass are public purposes and provide for the public health and general welfare.
Regulations of the gateway overlay zoning district are as follows:
84.1.
Applicability. Any lot within 500 feet of a gateway highway shall be included in the gateway overlay. If any portion of a lot is affected by the overlay than the entire lot shall conform to section 84. Buffers shall be required between dissimilar districts, incompatible uses or specified properties, frontage strips shall be required for all property fronting on a gateway, landscape strips shall be provided between commercial properties, and parking lots shall provide required landscaping in accordance with the provisions of the gateway overlay zoning district or as a condition of zoning, building permit, conditional use permit or variance approval.

84.11.
Tree protection.
a.
Planning considerations: Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the development process. The root systems of trees do extend beyond the drip line of the canopy. The root system within the drip line region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this root zone will directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these trees' critical root zones the following standards shall apply:
1.
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization as related to tree protection.
2.
Tree protection zones for stands or single trees should include an area no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy drip line of that tree(s).
3.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities must be placed along corridors between protective zones.
4.
Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection zones.
5.
No disturbances shall occur within the protective zone of stands of trees during construction.
b.
Protective barriers: Protective tree barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones of all designated tree protective zones prior to any land disturbances.
1.
These barriers will be a minimum of four feet high constructed in a post and rail configuration. Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable.
2.
Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging.
3.
All tree protection zones should be designated as such with a "tree save area" sign posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are highly recommended for site entrances.
4.
All designated tree protection zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion material. Type A, B or C silt screening as defined in the "Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia" shall be installed when necessary along the outer uphill edge of the tree protection zone at the land disturbance interface, and shall remain in place throughout the construction and landscape installation process.
c.
Encroachment: Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of designated tree protective zones the following preventive measures shall be employed:
1.
Where soil compaction might occur due to traffic or material storage the tree protective zone must first be mulched and maintained with a minimum four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw.
2.
The installation of utilities through a protective zone shall occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root pruning procedures must be employed.
3.
No fill shall be allowed within the drip line.
4.
Where the zoning officer has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced.
d.
Landmark and historic trees: The "Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register" was established in 1994 by the Georgia Urban Forest Council. The register serves as a record of all the significant trees across the state.
Landmark and historic trees are those individual trees or groups of trees that have been designated as significant on the basis of their importance in national, state, or local history. They possess integrity of location, setting, design, progeny, and represent events, heritage, feeling and association.
Inclusion of a tree or group of trees on the register is used for the protection and preservation of the tree(s). Any tree or group of trees which is included on the "Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register" is prohibited from being damaged and may be removed only with prior planning and zoning department approval. If a historic and/or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval, the planning and zoning department will impose a fine equal to $1,000.00 per inch DBH of the damaged or removed tree(s).
1.
Landmark trees: For a tree or group of trees to be considered landmark for inclusion by the Georgia Urban Forest Council on the "Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register" at least one of the following criteria must be satisfied:
A.
The tree(s) is/are commonly recognized as an established and familiar feature of the community or as a significant part of the community's heritage;
B.
The tree(s) must have been planted and maintained for educational purposes for more than 75 years;
C.
The tree(s) was/were planted as a memorial to an individual, group event or cause and is confirmed to be more than 75 years old;
D.
The tree(s) symbolize(s) a historically significant individual, place, event or contribution.
2.
Historical trees: For a tree or group of trees to be considered a landmark for inclusion by the Georgia Urban Forest Council on the "Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register" at least one of the following criteria must be satisfied:
A.
The tree(s) is/are identified with a historically significant individual or group.
B.
The tree(s) is/are located at the site of a historical event and significantly affects one's perception of the event.
C.
The tree(s) date(s) to the time of a historic event at the location of the tree.
D.
The tree(s) is/are confirmed as the progeny of a tree that meets any of the criteria.
3.
Hazard trees: In the event a specimen, historic or landmark tree is determined to be a hazard to property, power lines or people the tree may be removed without recompense or penalty only with prior approval from the zoning enforcement officer.
84.12.
Tree planting specifications.
a.
Planting: Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication.
b.
Spacing: No trees may be planted closer than 20 feet.
c.
Utilities: No street trees other than those species listed herein as small trees may be planted under or within ten lateral feet of any overhead utility wire, or over or within five lateral feet of any underground water line, sewer line, transmission line or other utility.
d.
Distance from curb: The distance trees may be planted from the curb or curb lines and sidewalks will be no closer than four feet.
84.13.
Maintenance. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a horticultural healthy and aesthetically pleasing manner.
a.
Upon final installation of new trees, shrubs or other landscape material planted to meet the requirements of this resolution, and following acceptance by the zoning enforcement officer in accordance with the procedures in the Jones County Comprehensive Land Development Resolution, the developer shall guarantee all plant materials and provide adequate maintenance of the improvements for a minimum of one year from implementation.
b.
Continuing maintenance. The owner, occupant, tenant, and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the perpetual maintenance and protection of buffers and landscape plantings required by this resolution.
c.
Buffers that, over a period of time, lose their screening ability shall be replanted to meet the requirements of this resolution.
d.
Replacement trees and landscaping shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of this resolution.
e.
Each owner, lessee, or occupant of any site shall provide for the maintenance and upkeep (lawn care, leaf and trash removal, pruning, fertilizer, etc.) of their parcel at least once a week during the growing season and once every two weeks in the winter.
f.
Pruning of trees. Pruning of the center leader or "topping" of any tree is not allowed at any time. If the tree is damaged (whether from a storm or accident), it will be up to the discretion of the zoning enforcement officer as to whether the tree should be replaced or pruned and cared for by a tree surgeon.
g.
Pruning of all trees and shrubs shall be done in a manner to protect and enhance the natural character of the plant.
h.
Protection of plant material. In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury from pedestrian or motor traffic, said plants shall be protected by appropriate curbs, bollards, tree guards or other effective devices.
i.
Irrigation. All flower beds/seasonal color and sodded areas throughout the site shall be provided with an automatic underground irrigation system utilizing pop-up heads where feasible.
j.
Swale and erosion control. All areas with slopes steeper than six to one, or areas prone to erosion, shall be sodded or planted with low-maintenance shrubs or ground cover to maintain smooth slopes, and to prevent erosion. Acceptable plant materials shall include approved sod, ground covers, or low-growing shrubs as appropriate. Swales shall have side slopes and back slopes no steeper than three to one.

T.
Riverbank. The rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
U.
River corridor. All the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river, and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the riverbanks.
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbanks, usually marked by a break-in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering riverbank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Jones County Comprehensive Plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.

DD.
Wetlands. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
85.4.
Groundwater recharge area overlay district.
85.41.
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste, and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
85.42.
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
85.43.
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area overlay district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18" (1989 Edition). Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20" (1992 Edition). Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this resolution.
85.44.

Notes to tables:
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical sized home (three or four bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed for construction, or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Jones County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Jones County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to: the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, the need for subsurface drainage, or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: right-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other body of water, and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system, and an area equal in size for a conventional system, or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by a nonpublic or individual water supply system, or 1,200 gpad when served by a public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpad. To determine the square footage of the lot needed (X), use the following formula:
X = 5,000 gal/day
1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres x 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed.
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed (Y), for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpad, use the following formula:
Y = 5,000 gal/day
600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres x 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.
85.45.
Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this resolution is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in section 85.44.C. and D.
85.5.
Wetlands protection overlay district.
85.51.
Findings of fact. The wetlands within Jones County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities.
85.52.
Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands, and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
85.53.
District delineation. The wetlands protection overlay district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Jones County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this resolution, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Jones County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this resolution does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
85.54.
Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use, except those identified in section 85.55, shall be allowed within the wetland overlay district without a development permit from Jones County. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection overlay district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
85.55.
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection overlay district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 Regulations [of the Clean Water Act], provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit.

Water supply watershed protection overlay district.
85.61.
Purpose. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Jones County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
The purpose of this resolution is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Jones County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This resolution shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within Jones County.
85.62.
Establishment of water supply watershed overlay district. The Ocmulgee and Town Creek Water Supply Watershed Overlay Districts are hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the Ocmulgee and Town Creek water supply intakes and Town Creek Water Supply Reservoir. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes or reservoirs. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Overlay Map of Jones County. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this resolution by reference.
The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined, and the boundaries shall be identified on the water supply watershed district overlay map:
(1)
The Ocmulgee Watershed is a large water supply watershed. An intake from which the water is pumped and transported to the Town Creek Reservoir is located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir.
(2)
The Town Creek Watershed is a small water supply watershed. An intake for Macon-Bibb County is located on this creek. This water supply watershed contains a reservoir that is located in unincorporated Jones County. The Macon Water Authority has a reservoir management plan in place.
(3)
Town Creek Reservoir: The normal pool level elevation at contour line (E1.375).
85.63.
Protection criteria. The following regulations shall apply to the Ocmulgee Water Supply Watershed identified on the adopted map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir:

River corridor protection overlay district.
85.71.
Purpose. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
The Ocmulgee River has been designated as a protected river by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this resolution is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Ocmulgee River as defined herein.
85.72.
Establishment of Ocmulgee River Corridor Protection Overlay District. The Ocmulgee River Corridor Protection Overlay District is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Ocmulgee River within Jones County and being within 100 feet horizontally on the eastern side of the river as measured from the riverbanks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Ocmulgee River Corridor Protection District Overlay Map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this resolution by reference.
