Determine funding. The USER is responsible for providing proper funding. Specific budget account numbers must be on the purchase requisition.
(c)
Determine specifications. The USER is responsible for determining the quantity, quality, dimensions, duration and all other necessary specifications essential to the determination of what is to be procured. The specifications must, where applicable, conform to the approved city standards for identity and continuity.

(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-626. - Purchasing functions.
(a)
Source selection. Except as provided in this section, all vendor selections shall be made by the purchasing office. When making the vendor selection, the purchasing office will choose the lowest, best, responsible, responsive vendor. It is recognized that exceptional requirements may dictate that the USER is instrumental in selecting vendors. In such cases, it is necessary that this need be transmitted to the purchasing office with sufficient documentation as to the reason for the exception. This must be done in advance of any firm negotiations or commitment with the vendor.
(1)
In determining where to purchase products and services based on competitive prices and costs incurred in obtaining the purchase, the city shall purchase locally when all of these requirements are equal.
(2)
The city shall not make purchases of products or services from city employees or councilmembers or from businesses owned by members of these two groups. The city shall have the right to piggyback from other city, county, local authority and board of education contracts if the vendor will extend the same prices, terms, and conditions to the city. This source selection shall only be available where competition was used by the other agency to secure the contract and only for a period of 12 months following entry, renewal or extension of the contract by the other agency. This provision shall not apply for any contract where state law mandates the city utilize its own competitive procurement process.
(b)
Quotation/bidding. All quotations for materials or service must be requested through the purchasing office. Price quotations will be obtained in accordance with city ordinances.
(1)
Exception for professional services. The quotation/bidding requirements of this subsection (b) do not apply to contracts for professional services, so long as the anticipated value of such services is $50,000.00 or less. The city may, in its sole discretion, utilize competitive procurement methods in the procurement of professional services, irrespective of the exemption noted above. For the purposes of this division, the term "professional services" shall mean services requiring the exercise of substantial discretion and independent judgment, rendered by an individual or firm having expertise due to advanced, specialized education, training, licensure or skill customarily acquired either by a prolonged course of study or equivalent experience.

"Professional services" generally do not include skilled or licensed trades such as the installation, maintenance and repair of HVAC, plumbing, electrical wiring, and vehicles. The purchasing office shall make the final determination regarding which services are classified as professional services.
(2)
Verbal quotes. Requisitions for items under $5,000.00 require at least three documented verbal quotes. The vendor name and quote must be written on the requisition, which is used to generate the purchase order.
(3)
Written quotes. Purchasing will receive at least three written quotes on items requisitioned that are valued over $5,000.00 and up to $50,000.00. These requests will always be made in writing. The request for quotes can be made either verbally or in writing; the purchasing agent will determine this.
(4)
Sealed bids.
a.
The purchasing office will request sealed bids on items or projects requisitioned that meet the following criteria:
1.
The items or projects are valued over $50,000.00.
2.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.

c.
O.C.G.A. §§ 36-91-70 and 36-91-90 require public works projects over $100,000.00 to have payment bonds and performance bonds for 100 percent of the contract amount. When these bids are requested, the standard city documents with this information will be used. The city will also require that a five percent bid bond be submitted with the bid. These projects will be advertised in the legal organ of the city.
d.
Sealed bidding process and award.
1.
Receipt of bids. No bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the bid request. The purchasing agent shall cause all bids to be stamped with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city, and shall be returned unopened to the bidder.
2.
Bid openings. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the bid letter. The name of each offerer, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened.

3.
Modification of bids. Any clerical mistake which is patently obvious on the face of the bid may, subject to the limitations described in this section, be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the offerer. A nonmaterial omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the city's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to the price or insurance shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after the bid opening.
4.
Withdrawal of bids. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, the bidder shall give notice in writing of his or her claim of right to withdraw his or her bid within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
5.
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the specifications. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
6.
Bid cancellation. A bid may be canceled prior to the opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the city's best interest in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file.
7.
Modification of specifications after bid opening. The city reserves the right to negotiate with the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder after the bids have been opened and before an award is made in an effort to make sure that the specifications and budget have been met. This will allow staff to add or delete parts for equipment or value engineer a project in the city's best interest. On construction projects, the negotiations will be conducted with the design firm and city staff before a recommendation is made for the award of the bid.
8.
Negotiation with lowest, responsive and responsible bidder. Once a bid has been opened and accepted, the city reserves the right to negotiate with the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder in an effort to ensure that the bid meets the approved budget and specification.

a.
When the quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to the price in procurement of technical supplies or services.
b.
When the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest.
c.
When the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
d.
RFPs will generally be solicited on a project-by-project basis. Professional services may be solicited in multiyear increments deemed beneficial to the city based upon the investment of staff time and return on such investment through savings on existing prices for service. The USER will submit the scope of services to purchasing, which will then determine which of the following processes to use:
1.
Purchasing will request letters of interest and statements of qualifications from qualified firms. The responses will be reviewed by the USERS and the purchasing agent and interviews will be conducted with the firms selected by them. The price proposals will be requested from the most qualified firms.
2.
Purchasing will request letters of interest, statements of qualifications and price proposals from qualified firms. The USERS and the purchasing agent will review the information submitted and make a selection from this information. This process should be used when the city is familiar with the firms.
3.
Purchasing will request letters of interest and statements of qualifications from qualified firms and schedule a meeting with all the firms to discuss the project and answer questions. Then the firms who have attended the meeting will submit price proposals. The USERS and the purchasing agent will review all the information and make a selection.
4.
Request for proposal receipt, evaluation and award.

A proposal delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city and shall be returned unopened to the bidder.
(iii)
Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the RFP. The name of each proposer shall be announced but no other information shall be disclosed nor shall the proposals be considered an open record until a contract is awarded.
(iv)
Proposal cancellation. A RFP may be canceled prior to the opening date or any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the city's best interest in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office, or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the proposal file.
(v)
Evaluation of proposals.
A.

Emergency purchasing. It is understood that, from time to time, occasions arise at departments which require immediate action to purchase items in order to prevent disruption of operations. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services, and where the adverse effect of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time.
a.
If the emergency occurs after normal business hours and the purchasing agent is unavailable, the department directors/chiefs will be given the same authority as the purchasing agent. The documentation and purchase requisitions are to be submitted to the purchasing office as soon as possible following the emergency.

Adherence to these regulations and procedures concerning dollar amounts and bidding will be followed as closely as circumstances will allow. All emergencies will be documented and reports given to the city manager, mayor, and council.
(6)
Brand name purchases. The purchasing agent may elect to purchase brand name products or services when the goods comprise a major brand system, program or service previously selected by the city and, due to operational effectiveness, future enhancements or additions, or maintenance or storage of spare parts, precludes the mixing of brands, manufacturers, etc.
(7)
Sole source purchases. A contract may be awarded or a purchase made without competition when the city determines that there is only one source for the required products, supply services, or construction items.

(8)
Grants/donations. Periodically, the city may be given private/public grants and donations from sources such as the state and federal government and private corporations. These types of solicitations are more restrictive and will dictate the procurement process and methodology that the city is to follow.
(9)
State contract.

The purchasing agent will review the contract for form, completeness, insurance considerations, legal implications, and any other items dictated by each situation. The contract will then be sent to the USER and approved by the director/chief and returned to purchasing. The purchasing office will be responsible for having the contract signed by the city manager or his or her designee after it is signed by the vendor.
b.
The purchasing office will forward three copies of the contract for signature to the vendor, with the vendor returning two copies.
c.
The original of the contract will be filed in the open contract file. The other copy will be attached to the purchase order.
d.
A copy of the completed contract will be forwarded to the USER.
e.
Once a contract is awarded by the city the contract may be amended without the necessity of rebidding such contract; provided that such amendment shall not result in a variance in price exceeding ten percent of the original contract amount.
(g)
Delivery, quality, and payment. It shall be the responsibility of the purchasing office to ensure the quality, delivery, and payment of required goods and services.
(h)
Disputes. Final adjudication of any dispute between the vendor and USER shall be made by the purchasing office with appropriate input from the USER.
(i)
Vendor. In most cases, contact with vendors will be by the purchasing office and in conjunction with the USER as necessary. All vendors must coordinate with the purchasing office before visiting any other department. All visits must be made with the knowledge of the purchasing office and the purchasing agent has the option of accompanying the visitor. It is recognized that this restriction on visitation will not necessarily apply to those vendors with ongoing relationships, such as computer and copy machine service technicians.
(j)
Return of goods and/or cancellation of agreements. All returns of goods must be initiated by the USER through the purchasing office. Additionally, all cancellations of, or modifications to, any agreements must be made by the purchasing office.
(k)
Receiving of goods. It shall be the responsibility of the USER to ensure that purchased goods and equipment are received, inspected and verified as to condition. This will be accomplished by the use of a receiving report. Since the department director/chief signed the purchase requisition, he cannot be the receiver of the goods and must appoint an individual within the department to be the receiver of the goods and services.
(l)
Use of state/co-op contracts. The purchasing manager may, independent of the requirements of bid process of this article, procure supplies, services or construction items through the contract established through competitive means by the purchasing division of the state, national co-ops (i.e., U.S. communities), and collaborative purchasing agreements when deemed to be in the city's best interest.
(m)
Change orders.
(1)
The purchasing office will review all change orders and adjust encumbrances as applicable. Change orders will be processed to correct:
a.
The account distribution;
b.
Quantity;
c.
Addition/deletion of line items;
d.
Change in description; and
e.
Unit price.
(2)
If a quoted price is equal to or less than $5,000.00, the department head will approve. If a requisition for a change order is received for over $5,000.00, but the total procurement remains less than $50,000.00, the requisition will be sent to the city treasurer and city manager for approval. Any requisition with a change order where the total procurement equals more than $50,000.00 requires mayor/city council approval. The department cannot use the change order process to circumvent these purchasing regulations. Additionally, an available appropriation must exist for all change order amounts prior to approval occurring.

(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-628. - Procurement of engineering and design services for projects using Federal Aid Highway Program funding.
(a)
Applicability.
(1)
Section 2-628 applies only to the procurement of engineering and design related services for projects involving Federal Aid Highway Program funds, where construction is to be performed by the Georgia Department of Transportation or under its direct or indirect supervision.
(2)
For purposes of this section, "engineering and design related services" means professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, or incidental services that members of the architectural and engineering professions (and individuals in their employ) may logically or justifiably perform, including program management, construction management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design engineering, surveying, mapping, or architecture-related services. Excluded are services provided under any contract for construction work, including design-build contracts.
(3)
This section shall be interpreted to implement the federal procurement and contract administration requirements set forth at 40 U.S.C. § 1101—1104, 23 C.F.R. Part 172, and 2 C.F.R. Part 200, as may be amended in the future.
(b)
Competitive negotiation/qualifications-based selection.
(1)
Primary procurement method.
a.
Except in the exceptional circumstances described in subsection (c), procurement of contracts subject to this section shall follow the competitive negotiation/qualifications-based selection method set forth in this subsection.
(2)
Advertising of solicitation.
a.
Solicitation shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-state and out-of-state contractors are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract.
(3)
Solicitation process.
a.
Procurement may involve any of the following solicitation processes:
1.
Issuance of a request for proposals for a specific project.
2.
Issuance of a project-specific request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications, whereby responding contractors are ranked based on their qualifications. A request for proposals is then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified contractors.
3.
Issuance of a generic request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications on an annual basis, with responses kept for future use. As projects are developed, a project-specific request for proposals is provided to three or more of the most highly qualified contractors with qualifications on file.
b.
Regardless of the solicitation process used, a request for proposal specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a contractor's specific technical approach and qualifications.
(4)
Contents of request for proposal (RFP). Every RFP shall contain:
a.
A schedule of key dates for the procurement process and a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP which provides sufficient time for interested contractors to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances may be not fewer than 14 calendar days from the date of issuance of the RFP.
b.
All information necessary for interested contractors to provide a response to the RFP that is sufficiently specific and detailed that responses can be fairly judged based on quality.
c.
A clear, accurate, and detailed description of the scope of work, technical requirements, and qualifications of contractors, necessary for the services to be rendered. The scope of work shall detail the purpose and description of the project, services to be performed, deliverables to be provided, estimated schedule for performance of the work, and applicable standards, specifications, and policies.
d.
Specification of the procedure the city will follow for holding additional discussions with the most highly qualified contractors following submission and initial evaluation of proposals.
e.
Specification of the contract type and method(s) of payment to be utilized in accordance with subsection (b)(5)c. of this section.
f.
Identification of any special provisions or contract requirements associated with the solicited services.
g.
A requirement that the contractor identify and state the experience and qualifications of all key personnel who will work on the project.
h.
Notification that contractor or subcontractor suspension or debarment from work on federal contracts will disqualify a proposal. The RFP shall also contain a requirement that the contractor provide sufficient information to verify suspension and debarment status in accordance with 2 C.F.R. Part 1200 and 2 C.F.R. Part 180. The contractor shall be informed that its signature on any proposal or statement of qualifications constitutes an authorization to the city to ascertain the eligibility of the contractor to enter into a federally-funded contract, including without limitation confirmation of such eligibility on the federal government's award management website (www.sam.gov). In addition, the contractor and any subcontractor shall be required to certify as to their own current eligibility status, as well as that of their principals. Failure to provide the certification will result in the disqualification of the proposal.
i.
If one has been assigned by the Georgia Department of Transportation, identification of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) contract participation goal for the project.
j.
The requirement that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals, as cost shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase.
k.
Identification of all evaluation factors that will be used, including their relative weight of importance. Evaluation factors shall comply with the following minimum requirements:
1.
While the contract will be with the prime contractor, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime contractor and any subcontractors identified within the proposal.
2.
Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of contractors must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, pre-qualification in the appropriate technical areas by the Georgia Department of Transportation, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, suggestion of innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance.
3.
Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. This includes all price or cost related items such as cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs.
4.
In-state presence shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. However, compliance with state licensing laws and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement.
5.
The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted, provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed ten percent of weight given all evaluation criteria:
A.
A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a contractor to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified contractors, given the nature and size of the project. If a contractor outside of the local area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criterion.
B.
The contractor's disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) policy and practices, and the proposed participation of qualified and certified DBE subcontractors, may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 26. However, if a DBE goal has been established for the contract, the contractor's DBE qualifications cannot be used as a scoring criterion.
(5)
Evaluation and negotiation process.
a.
Evaluation and ranking of proposals.
1.
Following submission, proposals shall be evaluated and initially ranked based on the criteria established within the public solicitation.
2.
Next, the city shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions with no fewer than three of the most highly-ranked contractors to clarify as necessary the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP. (If only two or three qualified proposals are received, the city shall interview all qualified contractors.) Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview, or may be waived if proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria. In instances where only two qualified contractors respond to the solicitation, the city may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements that arbitrarily limited competition. In instances where only one qualified contractor responds to the solicitation, the city shall take reasonable steps to obtain more submissions, including extending the submission deadline or cancelling, modifying and re-advertising the procurement. If these steps remain insufficient to obtain at least two qualified contractor responses, the city may cancel the project or it may proceed with the evaluation/award process and, in consultation with GDOT, prepare a request for non-competitive award approval, which will be sent to FHWA.
3.
From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions that have been conducted, the City of Milton shall establish a final ranking, in order of preference, of at least three contractors determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria.
4.
Notification regarding selection of the three most highly-ranked contractor shall be provided to all responding contractors.
5.
The city shall then begin negotiations with the top-ranked contractor as set forth below.
b.
Procurement of independent price estimate.
1.
Before negotiating with the top-ranked contractor over price, the city shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and a fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the contractor services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost.
2.
Elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fee, and other direct costs) shall be established separately in accordance with 23 C.F.R. 172.11, and used to ensure the contractor services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost.
3.
In determining fair and reasonable compensation, the city will consider the scope, complexity, professional nature and estimated value of the services to be rendered.
c.
Contract provisions.
1.
In negotiating a contract, the city shall select one of the approved contract types specified at 23 C.F.R. 172.9(a) and shall include in the contract all of the appropriate provisions specified in 23 C.F.R. 172.9(a).
2.
The contract shall state the method of payment that will be used. Permissible methods of payment are specified in 23 C.F.R. 172.9(b).
3.
The contract may withhold retainage under the conditions specified in 23 C.F.R. 172.9(b)(6).
4.
The contract shall require the contractor to be responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that all costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with federal cost principles. The contract shall provide that if a contractor charges unallowable costs, the city may pursue all available administrative, contractual, or legal remedies and impose such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate.
5.
Each contract shall also contain all of the provisions specified in 23 C.F.R. 172.9(c). For this purpose, the city may incorporate (and modify as necessary) acceptable provisions developed by the Georgia Department of Transportation, including those provisions set forth at Section 7.18 of the GDOT Transportation Services Procurement Manual.
d.
Negotiation.
1.
Negotiations shall proceed in order of ranking. After obtaining an independent price estimate, the city shall negotiate the terms of the contract, including price, with the top-ranked proposer. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract, it shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the next highest ranked proposer, and so on, continuing the process until an agreement is reached. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the most qualified proposers, it shall select additional proposers in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations in accordance with this section until a satisfactory contract is achieved.
2.
The negotiated contract shall allow only costs or prices that are allowable in accordance with federal cost principles. The city shall comply with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. § 112(b)(2) and 23 C.F.R. 172.11(b) in calculating and negotiating contract costs or prices.
3.
To the extent the city uses an accepted cost rate or is involved in reviewing a cost rate proposal, it shall comply with the requirements of 23 C.F.R. 172.11(c) and (d).
4.
If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the contractor with which negotiations are initiated may be considered (cost proposals of multiple proposers may not be compared). Concealed cost proposals of contractors with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective contractor due to the confidential nature of this information (as specified in 23 U.S.C. § 112(b)(2)(E)).
(c)
Alternatives to competitive negotiation/qualifications-based selection requirement.
(1)
Alternative procurement methods.
a.
When appropriate, the "small purchase" method or the "noncompetitive" method of procurement may be used instead of the competitive negotiations/qualifications-based selection method. The city shall document the reasoning for selecting an alternative procurement method in the procurement file.
(2)
Small purchase/simplified acquisition method.
a.
Applicability.
1.
The small purchase method may be used in the procurement of engineering and design related services where the total contract costs do not exceed the lesser of (a) the federal simplified acquisition threshold, which is $150,000.00 (subject to updating at 2 C.F.R. § 200.88); or (b) the state simplified acquisition threshold, which is $75,000.00 (subject to updating at O.C.G.A. § 50-22-7(d)).
2.
Contracts procured under the small purchase method may not subsequently be modified or amended such that the total contract amount exceeds the threshold amount stated above.
3.
The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures.
b.
Method of procurement.
1.
For small purchase procurement, the city shall follow its standard procurement methods, subject to the following requirements:
A.
The city shall review submissions from a minimum of three contractors. In instances where only two qualified contractors respond to the solicitation, the city may proceed with evaluation and selection if it is determined that the solicitation did not contain conditions or requirements that arbitrarily limited competition.
B.
The allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with federal cost principles.
(3)
Noncompetitive method.
a.
Applicability.
1.
The noncompetitive method shall be used only upon the joint recommendation of the public works director and the procurement manager, based upon one of the following justifications:
A.
The service is available only from a single source;
B.
There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or
C.
After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate.
2.
The city must submit justification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and receive approval before using this method of contracting. The only exception to this is in the event of an emergency purchase where it is not feasible to obtain approval prior to performing work. In this event, the city shall proceed with the work and gather the information necessitating the emergency purchase and submit to FHWA as soon as practical.
b.
Method of procurement.
1.
The city shall use its standard noncompetitive procurement procedures, provided that the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with federal cost principles.
(d)
Additional requirements for contract procurement and administration.
(1)
Conflicts of interest.
a.
No employee, officer, or agent of the city may participate in the selection or in the award or administration of a contract if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict arises when there is a financial or other interest in the contractor selected for award by:

3.
His or her partner; or
4.
An organization that employs or is about to employ any of the above.

Appointment of responsible contract manager.
a.
For each contract procured under this section, the city shall appoint a qualified, full-time, public employee of the city to ensure that the work delivered under contract is complete, accurate, and consistent with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract. While an independent contractor may be procured to serve in a program or project management support role, or to provide technical assistance in review and acceptance of engineering and design related services performed and products developed by other contractors, the city shall designate a public employee as being in responsible charge of the contract. A public employee may serve in responsible charge of multiple projects and the city may use multiple public employees to fulfill monitoring responsibilities. The duties of the responsible public employee shall be as set forth at 23 C.F.R. § 172.9(d)(1).
(7)
Performance evaluation.
a.
At the appropriate time, the city shall prepare an evaluation summarizing the contractor's performance on any contract procured under this section. The contents and handling of the evaluation shall be as set forth at 23 C.F.R. § 172.9(d)(2). The evaluation shall be stored to allow the contractor's performance data to be used in the city's future evaluation and ranking of the contractor's ability to provide similar services.
(8)

a.
In addition to any requirements imposed by Georgia law, and subject to the specific provisions of 2 C.F.R. § 200.333, the city shall retain documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and ranking of the successful contractor, as well as negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract, for three years from the date that the city issues a final acceptance to the contractor of the construction project or the design consultant's work is complete as defined in the contract, whichever is later. This documentation shall include the contractor cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of any indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract.
(10)
Monitoring, enforcing, and contract close-out.
a.
The city shall follow its standard procedures, in coordination with the Georgia Department of Transportation, for monitoring the contractor's work and compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract; determining whether the contractor has complied with the terms of the contract and pursuing appropriate legal remedies; and closing out a contract.
