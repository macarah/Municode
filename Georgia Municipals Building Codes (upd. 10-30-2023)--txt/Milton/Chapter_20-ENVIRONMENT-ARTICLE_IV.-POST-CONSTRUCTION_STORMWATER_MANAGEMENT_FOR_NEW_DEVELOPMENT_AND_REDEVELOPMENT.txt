Prior to the issuance of any permit for a land development activity requiring a stormwater management facility or practice hereunder and for which the city community development department requires ongoing maintenance, the applicant or owner of the site must, unless an on-site stormwater management facility or practice is dedicated to and accepted by the city community development department, execute an inspection and maintenance agreement, and/or a conservation easement, if applicable, that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site.
(3)
The owner shall execute an inspection and maintenance agreement with the city obligating the owner to inspect, clean, maintain, and repair the stormwater management system, including vegetation in the final BMP landscaping plan. The form of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall be the form provided by the city or a city-approved alternate. After the inspection and maintenance agreement has been signed by the owner and the city, the owner shall promptly record such agreement at the owner's cost in the real property records of Fulton County for all parcel(s) that make up the site.
(4)
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall identify by name or official title the person(s) serving as the point of contact for carrying out the owner's obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The owner shall update the point of contact from time to time as needed and upon request by the city. Upon any sale or transfer of the site, the new owner shall notify the city in writing within 30 days of the name or official title of new person(s) serving as the point of contact for the new owner. Any failure of an owner to keep the point of contact up to date shall, following 30 days' notice, constitute a failure to maintain the stormwater management system.
(5)
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall run with the land and bind all future successors-in-title of the site. If there is a future sale or transfer of only a portion of the site, then:
a.
The parties to such sale or transfer may enter into and record an assignment agreement designating the owner responsible for each portion of the site and associated obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The parties shall record and provide written notice and a copy of such assignment agreement to the city.
b.
In the absence of a recorded assignment agreement, all owners of the site shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement regardless of what portion of the site they own.
(6)
The city may refuse to accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility if the director of public works or his/her designee determines that accepting the facility is not in the best interest of the city due to maintenance cost or other factors.
