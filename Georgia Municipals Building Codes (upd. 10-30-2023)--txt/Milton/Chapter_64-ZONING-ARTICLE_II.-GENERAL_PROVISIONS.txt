Within the zoning districts established by this ordinance, there may exist lots, structures, and uses of both land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was adopted or subsequently amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this zoning ordinance as adopted or subsequently amended. Nonconforming lots, uses and structures may continue in their nonconforming status with the following limitations and requirements:

a.
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a permitted use;
b.
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building which was arranged or designed for such use at the time the use became nonconforming, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
c.
If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restrictive nature;
d.
When a nonconforming use of a structure or a structure and land in combination is replaced with a conforming use, such structure or land may not later revert to a nonconforming use;
e.
When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination is discontinued or abandoned for one year, the structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
f.
A nonconforming use of a structure or a nonconforming use of land shall not be extended or enlarged by attachment to a building or land of additional signs which can be seen from off the land or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district.
(4)
Nonconforming structures. When a structure exists on the effective date of this zoning ordinance or its amendments that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance because of restrictions on building area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may remain as long as it complies with all other zoning regulations, subject to the following conditions:
a.
No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity;
b.
Destruction, by any means, of more than 60 percent of the gross square footage of a structure shall require that the structure be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance;

Exemptions due to state or city action. Whenever a lot becomes nonconforming as a result of land acquisition by the county or state, building permits shall be granted for new construction provided the proposed structure complies with all but lot area requirements, and setback requirements shall be reduced without the requirement for a variance to the extent of the width of the acquired property.
Whenever a structure becomes nonconforming as a result of city, county or state action other than an amendment to this zoning ordinance, the use of the structure may continue and the structure may be replaced as though no nonconformity exists if, subsequent to such action, the structure is destroyed.

DIVISION 4. - LARGE-SCALE RETAIL/SERVICE COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES AND DEVELOPMENTS 75,000 SQUARE FEET OR GREATER

Sec. 64-98. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The term "large-scale retail" means any individual retail establishment that is 75,000 square feet or greater. This size threshold refers to an individual establishment and its associated areas used for display and storage.
(b)
The purpose of establishing requirements for large-scale retail establishments is to apply design standards and additional conditions to large developments proposed in the city in order to ensure the development of appropriate, functional, well-planned, aesthetically pleasing retail/service commercial developments that stimulate economic and social growth, are integrated with surrounding areas, positively contribute to the changing community character, with facilities that have functional reuse potential in the future.
(c)
As such, these regulations intend to promote high quality materials and design, promote pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage infrastructure concurrency, encourage responsible stormwater management practices, and promote environmental planning policies.
(d)
The regulations are to be used in conjunction with the development criteria of the city zoning ordinance and all other adopted development standards and criteria, including overlay district standards.
Sec. 64-99. - Number, size and location criteria.
(a)
Large-scale retail establishments or developments cannot be accessed solely via collector or local roads, as defined by city guidelines and depicted on the Georgia DOT Road Functional Classification maps. They are solely permitted on sites with at least one frontage on an arterial road. However, the director may waive the road classification criteria if the developer can demonstrate that the proposed road improvements, with identified funding sources, will accommodate projected traffic volume to be generated by the proposed development to the degree that the current LOS or better is maintained for the affected road segment.
(b)
No more than four large-scale retail establishments, as defined in this zoning ordinance, are allowed in a single development. Developments may include additional smaller retail structures as part of the overall development; however the number of retail establishments 75,000 square feet or larger is limited to four, and such developments are subject to the regulations outlined in this zoning ordinance.
(c)
Developments are encouraged to create a cluster effect in order to achieve a village and/or town center effect. This zoning ordinance promotes an appropriate mix of large and small scale retail with smaller retail buildings located closer to streets in order to reduce the visual scale of the development, encourage pedestrian traffic, and promote the use of architectural details.
(d)
This ordinance also recognizes the varied types of developments in the city and promotes the use of screening and buffers in areas with a more rural aesthetic.
