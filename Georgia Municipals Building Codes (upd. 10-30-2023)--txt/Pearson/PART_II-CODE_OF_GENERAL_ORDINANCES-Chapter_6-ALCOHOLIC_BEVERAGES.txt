Sec. 6-11. - Findings.
(a)
It is the finding of the council that under circumstances related to the presence of minors in bars and/or establishments that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises causes and begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions.

Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the presence of minors in bars and/or establishments that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises are disorderly conduct, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and other related criminal conduct. Increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the presence of minors in bars and/or establishments that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises.
(c)
The council therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of our minor children and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of schools, and parks to prevent the adverse impact of the presence of minors in bars and/or establishments that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare by furthering legitimate governmental interest, such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration.
