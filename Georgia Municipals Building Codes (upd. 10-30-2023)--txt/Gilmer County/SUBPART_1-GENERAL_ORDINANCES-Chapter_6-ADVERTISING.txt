Sec. 6-31. - Introduction.
(a)
The county's population has grown substantially in recent years. With the increase in population has come a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the county. Uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial, and noncommercial information to the motoring public, to promote public safety, is essential.
(b)
Various and diverse businesses are located within the county. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the county's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety.
(c)
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the county without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values of the community. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the county in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.

(a)
The board of commissioners finds that:
(1)
The following regulations in this article are necessary to the county's fundamental goals of protecting the health, safety and welfare of residents, visitors and businesses in the county.
(2)
A sign is by its very nature designed to draw an individual's attention to that sign. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication; however this same characteristic can distract motorists and pedestrians thus creating traffic hazards.
(3)
The clutter created by excess in number, size and height of signs creates a distraction to travelers and negatively impacts the general appearance of an area. Signs may lessen the aesthetic qualities of an area and intrude upon the residential character of an area.
(4)
Signs must be regulated to insure that they are structurally safe and sound and for those signs illuminated electrical hazards are eliminated.
(5)
Proper regulation is necessary to limit the negative impact of signs while encouraging the positive and constructive uses of signs.
(6)
Signs enhance the economy and the business and industry of the county by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
(7)
Signs, which are compatible with their surroundings, will be promoted.
(b)
It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
