Sec. 24-2. - Definitions.
As used in this subchapter, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:
Alarm signal: A detectible signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the county sheriff's department, and/or the county fire department is expected to respond.
Alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department, and/or the county fire department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms.
Alarm systems coordinator: An employee of the county designated by the board of commissioners to administer this subchapter.
Alarm user:
(1)
The owner and/or resident of any residence in which a household alarm system has been activated;
(2)
In the case of a commercial business, any manager or operator of a facility in which a commercial alarm system has been activated; or
(3)
Any person(s) registered with the county as a user of an alarm system.
Calendar year: For purposes of this code section, calendar year shall be defined as beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year.
Commercial alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event, including fire, at a commercial business or premises requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department and/or the county fire department is expected to respond. Apartment complexes shall be considered as commercial premises.
False alarm: The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement or emergency personnel unless response was canceled by the alarm user or his agent before personnel are dispatched to the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this subchapter when, upon investigation or inspection by county employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
Household alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event at a residential address or premises requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department and/or the county fire department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms.

Sec. 24-6. - Government immunity.
