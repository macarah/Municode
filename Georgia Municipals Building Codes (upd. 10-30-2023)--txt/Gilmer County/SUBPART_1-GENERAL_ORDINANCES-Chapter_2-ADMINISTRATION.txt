Editor's note— Res. No. 18-095, adopted Sept. 13, 2018, amended div. 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 2 pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 2-111—2-119, and derived from an ordinance adopted Apr. 7, 1993.

Sec. 2-111. - Purpose.
The purpose of this code of ethics is to:
(1)
Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by county officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the county;
(3)
Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the county; and
(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
(Res. No. 18-095, 9-13-2018)
Sec. 2-112. - Scope.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to county officials.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This ordinance shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law.

The terms do not include other county elected officials, county employees, the county attorney, the executive assistant to the board of commissioners, the comptroller, or department heads or chief executive officers, by whatever names designated, of the various departments of the county.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the board of commissioners or other county board, commission, or authority, as well as the discussions or deliberations of a county board, commission, or authority which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.

Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.

Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where:
