Sec. 38-21. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b)and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16) of this section in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(15)
Except as provided in subsections (16), (17) and (18), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his/her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his/her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(17)
There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and

(a)
The city is subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages.
(c)
Increased velocities and quantities of water draining off developed land causes erosion, sedimentation and maintenance problems resulting in significant damages.
(d)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(e)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(f)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(g)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of a storm sewer system.
(h)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm sewer system.
(Ord. No. 97-1, § 2, 1-28-1997)
Sec. 38-88. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote, protect, maintain and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damages at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, wetlands, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Comply with state (DNR) and federal (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include:
a.
Control the contribution of pollutants to the storm sewer system by stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of commercial and industrial activity;
b.
Prohibit illicit connections to storm sewers;
c.
Control discharge to storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and

The enactment and enforcement of this article is intended to address the following policy objectives:
(1)
To recognize the necessity of and to encourage joint action and a full exchange of information by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems, the prevention of their worsening or recurrence and the implementation of these objectives;
(2)
To work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the objective stated in subsection (1) of this section by encouraging through this article and other public actions the development of on-site self-maintaining retention/detention facilities and for off-site centrally located regional retention/detention facilities;
(3)
To maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions;
(4)
To incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system;
(5)
To require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system;
(6)
To encourage the construction of joint retention/detention ponds serving several properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the city upon completion of project development. The city encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these retention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate in the construction of major retention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems;
(7)
To encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge which shall be acceptable shall include, but need not be limited to, retention/detention ponds, percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the city encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located; and
(8)
To require any development to retain any runoff which exceeds an allowable increase of one cubic foot per second per acre caused by the development and to utilize the parking area or privately owned retention/detention facility.

Secs. 38-147—38-175. - Reserved.
DIVISION 4. - DRAINAGE

Sec. 38-176. - Standards.
(a)
Water quality goals and objectives contained in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (CSS), and any relevant local addenda, will be followed in design of stormwater systems.
(1)
CSS compatibility with other regulations: This subsection (a) is not intended to interfere with, modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(b)
All engineering design items for storm drainage and erosion control and sedimentation control and delineation of the 100-year floodplains shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the liberty consolidated planning commission. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area.
(c)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second per acre for a 25-year frequency (type II) storm. This shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres.
(d)
The release rate of stormwater from all developments where detention is required shall:
(1)
Not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state for all intensities up to and including the 25-year frequency for all durations of rainfall; or
(2)
Not be greater than that calculated for a 25-year (type II) frequency storm with a runoff coefficient of 0.20, 0.25 and 0.35 for land with an average slope of up to two percent.
(e)
The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a (type II) storm of 25-year design frequency except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency.
(f)
Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt build-up.
(g)
The live retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the National Weather Service for the affected areas. The retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 25-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the proposed development, with a release rate that does not exceed the pre-development runoff. Retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention/detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in previous sections and will have provisions for overflow of the 100-year storm without damage to the structure.
(h)
When the developer requests and the liberty consolidated planning commission determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the liberty consolidated planning commission upon application for approval being submitted through the planning commission. Where joint retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention facility, except upon approval of the liberty consolidated planning commission.
(i)
When adequacy of existing drainage structures is being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention/detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate. The developer will be responsible for providing calculations and studies needed to evaluate downstream structures. If an existing structure not being modified by the development is found to be inadequate to handle the pre-development flows, the developer shall provide calculations to show the structure size required to handle the pre-development flows of the entire basin area. The city at that time will evaluate its ability to modify that structure. This evaluation will take into consideration available funds, required permits, capabilities of downstream structures and current work loads. Based on the counties findings, the developer will be notified within 45 days of the county's intentions for modification and any schedule required for modification of structures.
(j)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all retention, detention and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff.
(1)
Permanent chainlink fencing at least six feet in height shall be required around all these facilities. This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment (if intended) into the facility. The fence shall include a lockable gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities (12 feet minimum). Different fencing material may be substituted for chain link upon approval of the liberty consolidated planning commission. Requirements for fencing may be waived if deemed necessary by the city council.
(2)
These facilities shall be located on tracts of land designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions including trees, utility poles, fences, buildings, headwalls, weirs, settling basins, top of slope or other drainage structures.
(3)
Perforated standpipes or a french drain, as approved by the county engineer, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and/or inadequate drainage shall be installed within all these facilities.
(4)
Except as provided in subsection (i)(5) of this section, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these retention facilities during grading, construction and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
(5)
In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of this article, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by Georgia Laws 1972, p. 1552 will be established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage.
(6)
These facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the adoption of this article will not be accepted for city maintenance unless individually approved and accepted by the city council and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the city council accepts a retention facility for city maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the retention facility is designed.
(7)
Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the city as authorized by Georgia Laws 1972, p. 1552, revenues to fund city maintenance of retention facilities may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the board of commissioners when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established.

Sec. 38-195. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, certain words or terms shall be defined as follows. Words not defined in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations their most reasonable application. Words used in the singular shall include the plural and the plural the singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future tense. The word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary. The word "may" is permissive. The phrase "used for" shall include the phrases "arranged for," "designed for," "intended for," and "occupied for."
Administrator is the director of the liberty consolidated planning commission or designee.
Buffer is any visual and physical separation between two parcels of land.
Caliper is the diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at six inches above ground level. This measurement is used for nursery-grown trees having a diameter of four inches or less.
Canopy trees are large preferred trees which provide canopy over streets and sidewalks and other paved areas. Upon reaching maturity, a canopy tree will achieve a canopy spread of in excess of 40 feet in diameter. Using a radius of 20 feet for calculation purposes, the canopy cover area for one mature tree will be equal to 3.1416 × 20 2 or 1,257 square feet. Total canopy coverage for one acre of land would be equal to 43,560 divided by 1,257 which equals 35 large canopy trees.
Critical root zone is the minimum area surrounding a tree that is considered essential to support the viability of the tree and is for purposes of this article equal to the diameter at breast height in inches (DBH) converted into the radius of the circular area in feet around a preserved tree.
Development is the act, process, or state of erecting buildings or structures, or making improvements to a parcel or tract of land.
Developable acre(s) is/are the land area(s) that can potentially be developed, i.e. this area does not include environmentally sensitive areas including but not limited to wetlands, stream buffers, marshlands, etc.
Diameter breast height (DBH) is the diameter or width of the main stem of a tree as measured 4.5 feet above the natural grade at its base. Whenever a branch, limb, defect, or abnormal swelling of the trunk occurs at this height, the DBH shall be measured at the nearest point above or below 4.5 feet at which a normal diameter occurs.
Exceptional tree is any tree designated, as provided for in this chapter, to be of notable historic interest, aesthetic value, or of unique character because of species, type, age or size.
Fifty percent canopy cover is a canopy expected to be achieved over a 30-year period by the planting of large, preferred trees or the retention of existing canopied trees which result in a minimum of 50 percent cover across the city. Fifty percent canopy cover will be approximately 18 large preferred trees per acre quantified as 1,600 tree quality points per acre.
Greenspace is any area retained as permeable unpaved ground and dedicated on the site plan to supporting vegetation.
Greenspace plan is a map and/or supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation (greenspace) is to be retained or planted in compliance with these regulations. The greenspace plan shall include a tree survey, tree establishment plan, and/or a tree protection plan, and a landscape plan.
Landscape plan is a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation is to be retained or provided in compliance with the requirements of this article. The landscape plan shall include any required buffer elements.
Landscape quality point is a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of small trees, shrubs, and ground cover which are planted or retained on a given site.
Native tree is any tree species which occurs naturally and is indigenous within the region.
Plot plan is a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where the building(s), driveway, utility corridors, and easements are to be located and where greenspace is to be retained or planted in compliance with these regulations.
Preliminary plan is a plan which shows the proposed design for a commercial project or subdivision as specified in the subdivision regulations.
Quality points factor is a decimal fraction that is assigned to each tree species in the tree lists and is used as a multiplier in calculating the tree quality points for any tree retained on a site.
Set-asides are lands dedicated to open space by the developer or owner. Examples of set-asides include parklands, recreation areas, medians of boulevards, etc.
Sketch plan is a conceptual layout for a subdivision as specified in the subdivision regulations.
Species diversity is a planting or retention of diverse tree species on a site or within the community to prevent dominance by any single type of tree. The purpose of this diversity is to prevent the destruction of the entire urban forest in the event of disease or pestilence. For any site of one acre or larger, no more than 45 percent of trees and shrubs planted shall be of the same species.
Tree easement is an easement not less than ten feet in width and not in conflict with any other planning requirements under the zoning and subdivision regulations for public planting and/or maintenance of canopy street trees exclusive of utility, drainage, or other easements. Administrative approval is required for easements greater than ten feet in width.
Tree establishment plan is a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be planted in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points.
Tree fund is the tree protection escrow fund established to receive funds paid in lieu of required tree quality points or for compensation for damage or removal of trees owned by the governing authority.
Tree protection plan is a map and surrounding documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees, and their corresponding tree quality points.
Tree protection zone is the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines of these regulations. The minimum tree protection zone required for retained trees is the tree diameter's inches (DBH) converted into feet of radius around the tree. For planted trees, see table.
Tree quality point (TQP) is a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of trees that are planted or retained on a given site. Tree quality points quantitatively express the desirable qualities of the species with regards to size for each tree that is retained on a site. For planted trees, tree quality points are an expression of species desirability and the expected mature size of each tree.
Tree Survey is a map or site plan prepared and sealed by a registered land surveyor within two years of the date of application. The survey shall be at the same scale as the required site development plan and shall include the following information:
The location of all trees 16 inches or greater within the limits of disturbance and 25 feet beyond in each direction or to the property line whichever is less.

Decay-resistant wood includes wood that is naturally decay resistant (e.g., cedar, cypress, redwood) or wood that has been chemically and/or mechanically treated (e.g., chromate copper arsenate (CCAJ) to a retention rate such that the manufacturer provides a guarantee against decay for 40 years.
Unfinished concrete block shall not be permitted. Chain-link or wire fences shall be permitted within nonresidential zoning districts to buffer similar uses provided that plant material is planted immediately behind or in front of the fence.
The height of a fence or wall shall not exceed eight feet. Fences and walls shall be interrupted at intervals not exceeding 25 feet by architectural features such as pilasters or columns or by various species of plants that are at least as tall as the fence or wall or taller.
The fence or wall shall be set back not less than five feet from the property line unless otherwise approved by the LCPC. The height of a fence or wall shall be measured from the finished grade at the base of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall, but shall not include columns or posts.
(3)
Hedges. For newly established hedges, plants shall be a minimum of three feet in height. The area between the property line and the hedge shall be grassed and well maintained.
(4)
Vegetative buffers. In general, the purpose of a vegetative buffer is to achieve a degree of opacity that prevents clear recognition of the use being buffered. There shall be no encroachment of structures or paving within the area designated as a buffer.
a.
Trees. Trees shall be planted in conformance with requirements of this article. Standards for the size, planting, protection, and care of trees planted within a required buffer shall conform to the requirements of this article regardless of whether tree quality points are requested for the trees.
b.
Shrubs. Shrubs shall be planted in conformance with the requirements of the landscape and tree protection article. Standards for the size, planting, protection, and care of shrubs planted within a required buffer shall conform to the requirements of this article or the landscape and tree ordinance manual regardless of whether landscape quality points are requested for the shrubs.
(5)
Preserved stands of vegetation within buffers. Preserved stands of mature trees within buffers shall also conform to the requirements of this article. The acceptability of mature stands of trees as a buffer shall be determined by the administrator in conformance with the provisions of said ordinance regardless of whether tree or landscape quality points are requested for the stands. Provided however; that selective hand clearing of underbrushing may be permitted if approved.
(6)
Other fences. In general, a wall or fence shall not exceed six feet unless specifically permitted or unless specifically requested by this Code. Under no circumstances shall a fence in the front yard be located parallel to the right-of-way that is higher than four feet.
(e)
Buffer and landscape/tree requirements. This is also addressed in section 6.14 and 6.14.2.3 as part of the OC-1 (commercial overlay district). In case of conflict or omission, the more stringent and/or more specific requirement shall prevail.

(2)
The administrator shall make a final inspection of the trees and landscaping at the scheduled completion of work. If work has been completed, the temporary tree and landscape bond shall be refunded. If the landscaping is not complete at the scheduled deadline, the temporary tree and landscape bond shall be withheld based on the amount of work incomplete.
(c)
Two-year tree and landscape establishment bond.
(1)
A two-year tree and landscape establishment bond equal to the value of 50 percent of the tree quality points shall be posted with LCPC after the administrator gives an approval of the trees and landscaping at the final inspection and prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
(2)
Two years after the date of the bond, the administrator will inspect the site and make a determination of whether the required trees and landscaping are viable, in which case the bond will be released. If deficiencies are found, the owner of the property shall be notified to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the deficiencies are not corrected in 90 days, the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance with the provisions of this article.

(1)
Any damage or injury occurring to a preserved tree by determination of the administrator sufficient to cause the tree to die within five years or develop into an irreparable hazard tree shall be removed and shall lose tree quality points. Any tree so removed from the site shall be replaced with a tree(s) of equal or greater tree quality points.
(2)
Damage not considered to be fatal to a preserved tree by the administrator but considered hazardous to the public shall immediately be repaired and shall result in a proportional decrease in tree quality points where applicable. Assessment of damage and repair shall be made by the administrator.
(3)
The property owner shall be solely responsible for watering and fertilizing trees and landscaping to maintain plants health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required points on the property shall be a violation of this article.
