Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of Dec. 9, 2008, repealed the former Ch. 6, §§ 6-1—6-6, and enacted a new Ch. 6 as set out herein. The former Ch. 6 pertained to adult entertainment and derived from Ord. No. 1997-2, §§ 1—3, §§ 5, 6, 2-25-1997.

Sec. 6-1. - Public purpose.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Garden Grove, California, Hinesville, Georgia, Austin, Texas, and Warner-Robins, Georgia, whose experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional, at the mayor and city council hearing on August 12, 2008; and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the mayor and city council on other occasions and on documentary evidence submitted to the mayor and city council, the mayor and city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the mayor and city council of the City of Flemington that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The mayor and city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and city council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
The mayor and city council finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. The mayor and city council of the city therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and city council of the city finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is hereby adopted.

In the event of the sale or other conveyance of the property within five years of the date of adoption of this ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the new property owner shall make application to transfer the zoning permit for the registered legal nonconforming use to the purchaser in order that the purchaser may enjoy the same protection afforded to non-conforming uses provided for herein.

For partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability companies, any transaction in which 30 percent or more of an ownership interest is transferred from one person or group of persons to one person or group of persons so that control in interest of the grantee is transferred or assigned to another person or group of persons shall constitute a conveyance for the purposes of this section.
