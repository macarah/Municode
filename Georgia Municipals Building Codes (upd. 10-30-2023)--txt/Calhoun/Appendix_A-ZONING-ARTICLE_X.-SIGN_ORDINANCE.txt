The mayor and city council find that there presently exists 98 miles of roads, streets, primary highways, and interstate highways within the city limits of which 12.77 miles are part of the primary highway system and 5.2 miles are part of the interstate highway system. There are presently 28 signs which can be categorized as billboards currently erected along and visible from I-75 and more than 17 similarly defined signs currently erected along and visible from the primary highway systems which pass through the city.
The mayor and city council find that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city directly affect the public, health, safety, welfare and property values in the community.

The mayor and city council finds that there remains a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of these regulations contained in this Code.

(d)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the surrounding area.
(e)
To maintain for the residents, workers, and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the city.
(f)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and developmental needs with safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to Calhoun.
(g)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses that are located within the city and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods, or services to promote economic vitality.
(h)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State of Georgia and United States Constitutions within the city.
(i)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts that are consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of the areas where the signs are to be located.
(j)
To allow certain signs that are of appropriate size, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this article but without a requirement for permits.
(k)
To provide for temporary signs in certain circumstances.
(l)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs.

(h)
When a non-conforming sign is destroyed, toppled, or structurally impaired by force majeure and such non-conforming sign cannot be restored through normal maintenance and repair as defined in this ordinance, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason for grant of a variance to re-erect the non-conforming sign.
