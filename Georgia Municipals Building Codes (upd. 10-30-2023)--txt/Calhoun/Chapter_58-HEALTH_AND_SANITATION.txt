Editor's note— Sections 1—13 of an ordinance adopted Apr. 25, 2011 , added provisions to the Code, but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as art. III, §§ 58-51—58-64 herein.

Sec. 58-51. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority.
new
(a)
Based upon the experience of other municipalities and counties, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems potentially faced by the City of Calhoun, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and city council that the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful controlled substances by unconventional pain clinics begets criminal behavior, tends to create an undesirable community and constitutes a danger to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Calhoun. Among the undesirable community conditions identified are drug addiction, drug overdoses, drug abuse, the illicit use of pharmaceutical drugs and other associated illegal activities. The mayor and city council find that such conditions increase expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence hereof and lead to a potentially dangerous condition for the citizens of the City of Calhoun. Therefore, this article is established to license certain entities and the same is created in the interest of public welfare and as a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the negative impact on the Calhoun community as set forth herein.
(b)
This article is adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 13.
(c)
This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the City of Calhoun.
(d)
This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of the City of Calhoun.
(e)
This article is further adopted pursuant to the Charter of the City of Calhoun.
