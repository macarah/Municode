DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 22-41. - Purpose and scope of tax.
The occupation tax levied in this article is for revenue purposes only and is not for regulatory purposes, nor is the payment of the tax made a condition precedent to the practice of any such profession, trade, or calling. The occupation tax only applies to those businesses and occupations which are covered by the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-13-5—48-13-26. All other applicable businesses and occupations are taxed by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinances.
(Ord. No. 583, § 12-10, 12-11-1995)
Sec. 22-42. - Right to establish exemptions or reductions in tax for certain businesses.
The mayor and council may by ordinance or resolution provide for an exemption from or reduction in occupation tax for one or more types of businesses or practitioners of occupations or professions as part of a plan for economic development or attracting or encouraging selected types of businesses or practitioners of selected occupations or professions. Such exemptions from or reductions in occupation tax shall not be arbitrary or capricious, and the reasons shall be set forth in the minutes of the meeting of the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 583, § 12-37, 12-11-1995)
Sec. 22-43. - Returns confidential.
Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax levied by this article, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, agent, or clerk of the city, or any other person, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross receipts or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this chapter. All contents of such return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents or clerks of the city using such returns for the purpose of the occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as employees. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the publication by the city officials of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof, or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the state, the United States, and other local governments.

State Law reference— Confidentiality of information, O.C.G.A. § 48-13-15.
Sec. 22-44. - Lien for delinquent tax.
In addition to the other remedies provided for in this chapter for the collection of the occupation tax levied in this chapter, the city clerk, upon any tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of the tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for the tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date when such tax becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for the tax, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of the city and the laws of the state. The lien of the occupation tax shall become fixed on and dated from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city clerk or the clerk's duly designated officer of the city upon the property of defendant located in the jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances and Charter of the city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of taxes.
