Discharge of hazardous wastes.
a.
The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e).
b.
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a)(21)a of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
c.
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
d.
In the case of any notification made under subsection (a)(21)a of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable.
(22)
Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
(e)
Permit for exceeding concentration limits. The utilities general manager may issue permits specifying limits greater than the limits in this article based on special agreements with the city, provided that all applicable state and/or federal categorical pretreatment requirements are met and provided that local treatment plant mass loadings are not violated. The permission to exceed concentration limits will be revoked if local treatment plant mass loadings are exceeded. Additional testing requirements will be necessary for an industry which seeks permission to exceed concentration limits and may include testing of the waste treatment plant influent and effluent as well as the user's own effluent. The costs associated with such testing will be paid by the user for the parameter the user seeks permission to exceed.
(f)
Modification of limits. The city reserves the right to modify the industrial discharge limits and conditions at the time of the permit renewal. Industrial users requesting a permit variance must do so at least 60 days prior to the expiration of their discharge permit.
(g)
Exemption from BOD loading levels. Industrial users that contribute mass BOD 5 loading at levels below one-fourth of one percent of the design BOD 5 loading may be exempt from industrial pretreatment requirements, unless they are subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards, in which case they will not be exempt. However, the city reserves the right to terminate such exemption provisions if the industrial discharge is deemed to interfere with POTW operations.
(h)
Local limits. The following are state environmental protection division approved technically based local limits for 12 mgd and 16 mgd average daily flows at the POTW. The city shall enforce the adopted limits for the 12 mgd plant until the current plant expansion to 16 mgd is completed.

(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(n), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-185. - Confidentiality of information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections, shall be available without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret, in which case the information may be withheld from the general public. The effluent data will never be considered as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential, and portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes, shall be transmitted to a governmental agency when required to document compliance with the pretreatment program. In matters of judicial review or enforcement proceedings against an industrial user, the city shall provide all available information pertaining to that industry to the governmental agency.
(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(o), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-186. - Monitoring facilities.
The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer, and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.

(a)
Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The utilities general manager shall notify all affected users of the new standard and applicable reporting requirements.
(b)
Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. For purposes of this subsection, the term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system and 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) or 40 CFR 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403, section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(q), 6-9-1997)

(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(t), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-191. - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the utilities general manager a report containing the information described in section 94-189(b)(1) through (7). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified.
(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(u), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-192. - Periodic compliance reports.
(a)
All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the utilities general manager, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 94-171.
(b)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(c)
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the utilities general manager using the procedures prescribed in this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(v), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-193. - Notification of violation; repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation of wastewater discharge limitations, the user must notify the utilities general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the utilities general manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the utilities general manager monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the utilities general manager resamples within a month following the violation.
(Code 1988, § 11-27; Ord. No. 613, art. 6(w), 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-194. - Accidental discharges; defenses; bypass.
(a)
Protection from accidental discharge; slug control plan. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. A slug discharge is any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to, an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. The city shall evaluate all industrial users of the need for developing a slug discharge plan at least every two years. Industrial users shall complete such a plan within 90 days after being notified by the city. No user shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge or slug loading procedures have been approved by the city. A slug control plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.
(2)
Description of stored chemicals.
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for followup written notification within five days.
(4)
If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measure for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge or slug loading, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(b)
Written notice of accidental discharge. Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug loading, the user shall submit to the utilities general manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
(c)
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event or a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(d)
Upsets.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (d)(3) of this section are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the utilities general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including the exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, upon reduction, loss, or failure of the user's treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment if provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost, or fails.
(e)
Defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of this article or the specific prohibitions if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(f)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section:
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (f)(3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utilities general manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the utilities general manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utilities general manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
Bypass is prohibited, and the utilities general manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment.

(b)
Compensation for injury to inspectors. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in subsection (a) of this section, any claims resulting from injury or death to the utilities general manager or duly authorized employees of the city shall be compensated by the company even when there is no negligence or failure on the part of the company.
(c)
Right of entry; sampling and monitoring. The utilities general manager shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article. Users shall allow the utilities general manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1)
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the utilities general manager will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(2)
The utilities general manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operation.
(3)
The utilities general manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated once a month to ensure their accuracy.
(4)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the utilities general manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(5)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the utilities general manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(d)
Testing by independent laboratory. At the order of the utilities general manager, all persons discharging wastewater into the city sewer system shall have their discharge tested by a city-approved independent testing laboratory at such person's expense at a frequency specified by the utilities general manager at his discretion.
(Code 1988, § 11-29; Ord. No. 613, art. 8, 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-222. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notice of violation. When the utilities general manager finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued under this article, the utilities general manager or his agent may serve upon the user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the utilities general manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The utilities general manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(c)
Show cause orders. The utilities general manager may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued under this article, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
(d)
Compliance orders. When the utilities general manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued under this article, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements deemed reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. When the utilities general manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or any permit or order issued under this article, the utilities general manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do one of the following:
(1)
Comply with the order.
(2)
Take appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
(Code 1988, § 11-31; Ord. No. 541B, § 2, 5-9-1994; Ord. No. 613, § 10.1, 6-9-1997)
Cross reference— Administration, ch. 2.
Sec. 94-223. - Emergency actions.

(Code 1988, § 11-31; Ord. No. 541B, § 2, 5-9-1994; Ord. No. 613, § 10.4, 6-9-1997)
Sec. 94-226. - Authority to terminate service; revocation of discharge permit.
(a)
Termination of service after notice and hearing. In addition to other remedies provided in this article, the utilities general manager may issue a show cause notice to any user who appears to be violating any provision of this article to show cause why sewer service should not be discontinued. The notice shall include the nature of the violation with sufficient specificity as to the character of the violation and the dates on which such violations occurred to enable the user to prepare a defense. Such notice shall be mailed to the user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or shall be personally delivered to the user at least 20 days prior to the proposed action, except in the event of an emergency. At the show cause hearing, the user may present any defense to such charges, either in person or through submission of written or documentary proof. Following the hearing or opportunity for a hearing, the city may at the city's discretion order termination of sewer service if satisfied from all available proof that the violation was willful and the termination is necessary to abate the offending condition or to prevent future violations. The city may terminate service for a period not to exceed one year for a willful violation and may terminate service indefinitely to abate offending conditions or prevent future violations subject to the correction of such conditions or violations by the user. Any violation of provisions of this article that is not corrected or abated following a notice and opportunity for a hearing shall be grounds for termination of water service and/or plugging of the sewer line.
(b)
Emergency termination of service.
(1)
The utilities general manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The utilities general manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(2)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utilities general manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utilities general manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utilities general manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (c) of this section are initiated against the user.
(3)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utilities general manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing.
(4)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(c)
Revocation of discharge permit. The utilities general manager may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the utilities general manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 94-146;
(6)

Sec. 94-229. - Civil penalties.
(a)
Generally. Any person, including but not limited to industrial users, who does any of the following acts or omissions shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 per day for each day during which the act or omission continues or occurs:
(1)
Violates any effluent standard or limitation imposed by a pretreatment program.
(2)
Violates the terms or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to a pretreatment program.
(3)
Fails to complete a filing requirement of a pretreatment program.
(4)
Fails to allow or perform an entry, inspection, monitoring, or reporting requirement of a pretreatment program.
(5)
Fails to pay user or cost recovery charges imposed by a pretreatment program.
(6)
Violates a final determination or order of the city.
(7)
Violates any provisions of this article, the pretreatment permit or any order.
(b)
Assessment procedure; appeals. Any civil penalty shall be assessed in the following manner:
(1)
The utilities general manager may issue an assessment against any person or industrial user responsible for the violation.
(2)
Any person or industrial user against whom an assessment has been issued may secure a review of such assessment by filing with the utilities general manager a written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for his objections and asking for a hearing on the matter involved before the city council. If a petition for review of the assessment is not filed within 30 days of the date the assessment is served, the violator shall be deemed to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final.
(3)
When any assessment becomes final because of a person's failure to appeal the utilities general manager' assessment, the utilities general manager may apply to the municipal court for a judgment and seek execution of such judgment and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of the assessment.
(4)
In assessing the civil penalty, the utilities general manager may consider the following factors:
a.
Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal activity.
b.
