Section 7.14. - PRD, planned residential development.
A.
Purpose and intent. The PRD district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and provide other public benefits. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed. However, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, water features, pool/clubhouse, playground equipment, recreational facilities, open space, pedestrian plazas, walking trails, etc. The PRD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments, which enhance the surrounding area.
A.1.
Building massing. Street fronting building facades greater than 150 feet in length shall be modulated with breaks in wall surfaces and materials at intervals not to exceed 150 feet, measured parallel to the street.
