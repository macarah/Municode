DIVISION 5. - IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN GENERALLY

Sec. 26-683. - Purpose.
The purpose of a well-designed subdivision, with all of the necessary improvements, is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impact and to ensure a project will be an asset to the community. To promote this purpose, the subdivision shall conform to the following improvement requirements and design standards which are designed to result in a well planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.

Numbered concrete monuments, four inches in diameter or square, three feet long with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at the intersection of curves and tangents along street lines, and at all corners of the plot. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pipes or pins not less than three-fourths inch in diameter and 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.

(1)
Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
(2)
Water supply.
a.
Each subdivision developer shall be required to provide a potable water supply subject to the approval of the city health department.
b.
Where specifically required by the city engineer, each subdivision developer shall provide the subdivision connection to the city water system.

(9)
Preparation of right-of-way.
a.
The full width of all roadways shall be prepared so that pavement and sidewalks (where required) can be constructed in such a manner that future extension of additional utilities or street improvements will not damage yards of abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees not impairing visibility.
b.
Before grading is started, the entire area to be paved shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the subdivider shall stockpile the topsoil later to be spread in all disturbed areas not paved.

(Ord. of 12-2003, § 10-1)
Sec. 26-791. - Application.
(a)
Before the recording of a final plat, or as a condition of final site plan approval, the mayor and city council may require and may accept in accordance with the requirements of this chapter the following guarantees:
(1)
The furnishing of a performance guarantee in an amount not to exceed 120 percent of the cost of installation of improvements;
(2)
The provision for a maintenance guarantee for a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be installed, or the improvements are covered by a performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, no performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee shall be required by the mayor and city council for such utilities or improvements.
(b)
The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the mayor and city council by resolution.
(c)
Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the developer may notify the mayor and city council in writing of the completion or substantial completion of improvement and it shall send a copy to the city engineer. The city engineer shall inspect all improvements of which such notice has been given and it shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the mayor and city council indicating either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.
(d)
The mayor and city council shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements on the basis of the report of the city engineer, and it shall notify the developer in writing of the contents of the report and the action not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice from the developer of the completion of the improvements. Failure of the mayor and city council to provide notification within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the developer of the completion of the improvements, shall be held to constitute approval of the improvement and the obligor as well as the surety, if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance guarantee for such improvements.
(e)
