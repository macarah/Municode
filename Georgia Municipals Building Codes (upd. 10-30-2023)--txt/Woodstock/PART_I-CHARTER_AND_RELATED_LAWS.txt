Ad valorem taxes for city purposes means all ad valorem taxes for city purposes levied by, for, or on behalf of the City of Woodstock, including, but not limited to, taxes to retire bonded indebtedness.
(2)
Homestead means homestead as defined and qualified in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-40.
(3)
Senior citizen means a person who is 62 years of age or over on or before January 1 of the year in which application for the exemption under this Act is made.
(b)
(1)
Each resident of the City of Woodstock who is a senior citizen is granted an exemption on that person's homestead from all City of Woodstock ad valorem taxes for city purposes on the homestead owned and occupied by such resident as a residence as follows:
(A)
For the taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, and prior to January 1, 2003, in the amount of one-half of the full value of that homestead;
(B)
For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, for the full value of that homestead.
(2)
The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall remain subject to taxation.
(c)
A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section unless the person or person's agent files an affidavit with the governing authority of the City of Woodstock or the designee thereof giving the person's age and such additional information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the governing authority of the City of Woodstock or the designee thereof to make a determination as to whether such person is entitled to such exemption. The governing authority of the City of Woodstock or the designee thereof shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose and shall require such information as may be necessary to determine the initial and continuing eligibility of the applicant for the exemption.
(d)
The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-50.1.

It shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under this Act to notify the governing authority of the City of Woodstock or the designee thereof in the event that person for any reason becomes ineligible for that exemption.
