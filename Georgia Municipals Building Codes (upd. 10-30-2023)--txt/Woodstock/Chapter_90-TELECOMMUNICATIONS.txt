The city shall cooperate with a grantee in negotiating and obtaining permission to use such facilities.
(c)
No poles, cables, equipment or wires for the construction, maintenance and operation of the CATV system shall be installed or the installation thereof commenced on any existing pole within the city until the proposed location, specifications and manner of installation of such cables, equipment and wires shall have been set forth upon a plat or map showing the existing poles, streets, alleys or highways within the city where such installations are proposed and submitted in writing by a grantee to the city manager and approved by that department in writing.

The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and a grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance.
