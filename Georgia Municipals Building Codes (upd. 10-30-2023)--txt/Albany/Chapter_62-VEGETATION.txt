The city arborist shall be responsible for permitting the removal of trees located on the public rights-of-way and other city property. Regardless the reason, no public tree in the City of Albany can be removed without the approval of the city arborist.
(2)
The city arborist shall review all requests for the removal of trees located on the public rights-of-way for new commercial development. The city arborist is authorized, at his/her discretion, to require as a condition of granting of approval for such removal(s), that such property owner shall pay all costs of removing such tree(s) and also to require that the tree(s) removed be replaced at some other nearby location by planting another tree(s), not necessarily of the same type. The city arborist may approve, approve with modifications, or deny the request.
(3)
The city arborist shall investigate all requests for the removal of trees located on the public rights-of-way by citizens. Public tree removal is permitted when trees are dead, dying, diseased, or hazardous. The city does not remove a public tree because it drops leaves, cones, or acorns. The city does not cut nor fill roots of public trees.
(4)
The city arborist investigates trees located on the public rights-of-way and other city property that have been damaged or removed without an approved permit.
(5)
The city arborist determines the value of public trees which are damaged or removed in accordance with the latest edition of the 'Guide for Plant Appraisal' and submits the calculations to the risk manager.

(Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015)
Sec. 62-36. - Tree density required.
(a)
Tree density required.
(1)
Any site on which there will be a tree activity shall have not less than 15 tree density units per acre.
(2)
The city desires not to create or impose undue hardship on lands which had impervious areas before the enactment of the first tree ordinance on May 12, 1992. Therefore for lands which do not meet the minimum tree density units and had impervious areas on May 12, 1992 the following applies:
a.
The tree density units required are adjusted by a percentage. This percentage is the ratio of existing preserved and used impervious area which was on the site on May 12, 1992 divided by the overall area of the parcel being developed. The resulting percentage is multiplied by the TDU requirements for the site and that number is subtracted from the original TDU requirements to determine the reduced TDU requirements.
b.
If requirement of subparagraph a. above causes an overall tree density unit total greater than the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1), then the required number of tree density units is reduced to require only the difference between the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1) and the existing tree density units.
c.
The minimum required new tree density units shall not be less than ten percent or require less than one tree (whichever is greater) to be planted;
(3)
Nothing in this division shall authorize the removal of existing trees as to reduce site tree units below 15 tree density units per site acre, and any such removal is prohibited.
(b)
Sites with new paved parking areas.
(1)
On sites where the tree density unit requirements have been met by trees retained on the site, any proposed or new parking areas shall be designed so as to provide for the preservation of existing trees, or living space for additional trees, to break up the expanse of the paved area(s) so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space.
(2)
On sites where the tree density unit requirements are not met by existing trees left on site, the site shall be designed to require planting tree density units in the expanse of the new parking area to meet the site's required tree density units; and at a ratio of not less than one tree density unit per 25 parking spaces, and so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space. If there are tree density units remaining after meeting the previous requirement, then these tree density units may be placed at the applicant's discretion anywhere on the site as per section 62-37, (d) Tree density unit credit for new trees, (10) (11), and (12).
(3)
Multi-level or covered parking areas are exempt from the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) above.
(c)
Off-site tree planting requirements/dedicated tree account. On sites to be altered having serious space limitations such as party walls, zero lot lines or other similar restrictions and having less than 7,500 square feet of paved area, the applicant may elect to:
(1)
Where tree density unit requirements still remain, pay to the city $300.00 per remaining tree density unit. All checks or money orders shall be made out to the "City of Albany". The money shall be paid through the office of the city arborist into a dedicated tree account to be used only for the purchase of new and replacement trees and all materials needed to properly install the trees on public lands, rights-of-way, and on tree easements abutting public lands and rights-of-way, as designated by either the city arborist or the executive director of Keep Albany-Dougherty Beautiful.
(2)
On sites to be developed with fewer than 100 parking spaces, when it is impractical to meet the criteria for replanting on the confines of the property to be developed, as determined by the arborist and/or engineering department, then applicant shall provide for replanting to occur on other properties within the city, public or private, that are acceptable to the city arborist, provided all other requirements are met. As an option to the provision for off-site replanting, the applicant may pay to the dedicated tree account $300.00 per tree density unit to plant the required number of replacement trees on public lands and rights-of-way.
(Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015)
Sec. 62-37. - Tree density unit credits.
(a)
TDU credits. To receive any TDU credits the minimum caliper, the minimum square footage of living space and the minimum living space radius are required. This applies to healthy, actively growing trees and requires approval by the city arborist. If a tree is in a location where a protection zone is needed or is determined to be needed, a protection zone is required to receive any TDU credits for that location.
(b)
Protection zone. The physical barrier shall extend a minimum distance in all directions from the tree base at least one foot for each inch of trunk diameter. Physical barriers include but are not limited to: fencing, security screens, silt fence style of fencing, and construction warning fencing. Special conditions may warrant an adjustment to this requirement. The code enforcement officer with the city arborist's guidance shall set the special conditions and may grant adjustments to this paragraph on a case by case basis.
(c)
Tree density unit credit for existing trees. Conversion from "diameter at breast height" (DBH) to "tree density unit" (TDU) is provided in the table below. To receive credit for the trees remaining on site, the minimum living space and minimum radius for living space are required. (see Appendix A). If the existing tree is a species not on the new tree list, approval must be obtained from the city arborist to receive credit. Existing trees identified as invasive species by the city arborist will not receive credit. The list of invasive species, identified by common name, includes: Catalpa Tree, Cottonwood, Royal Princess Tree, Cherry Laurel or Black/Wild Cherry, Hackberry or Sugarberry, Mimosa, Chinaberry, Tree of Heaven, and Chinese Tallow. The city arborist shall add other tree species to the list as needed.

  (d)
Tree density unit credit for new trees. New trees are either approved shade trees or ornamental trees. Each listed tree has an individual tree density unit depending on the size, shape, and desirability. The minimum tree density unit is one-half and the maximum is one and one-half. Trees are designated as small, medium, or large relative to their potential size and the minimum living space requirement ranges from 100 to 400 square feet for any new trees planted outside the perimeter of parking areas (see Appendix A). A minimum radius of three feet living space for trees planted within the landscape islands of parking areas is required.
(1)
Appendix A (at the end of this division) contains the listing of trees that are available to receive credit. The appendix contains common tree name, botanical name, minimum living space, tree density units, and general comments.
(2)
The caliper of new trees is required to be between one and one-half and three and one-half inches, except that a pine tree caliper is required to be between one and one and one-half inches.
(3)
Palm trees are assigned credit based on height, not caliper, and receive one-half TDU credit for each ten feet height increment.
(4)
All new trees shall be planted on site between October 1 and April 15 unless an operational underground or drip irrigation system exists in place or the city arborist grants permission otherwise.
(5)
Trees not on the list are required to be reviewed and approved by the city arborist prior to any tree permit application submittal.
(6)
At least one-half of the new trees shall be from the shade tree class regardless of whether planting is for the purpose of meeting parking area requirement or TDU requirement.
(7)
No more than one-third of the new trees shall be from any one species regardless of whether planting is for the purpose of meeting parking area requirement or TDU requirement.
(8)
For a new tree surrounded by existing or new pavement, the minimum required living space is 150 square feet for all species.
(9)
Crape myrtles may be grouped together, in maximums of three per single living space, though the minimum living space becomes 150 square feet.
(10)
Trees being placed for this requirement may not be placed in locations such as sight clear zones that may cause hazardous situations for traffic.
(11)
Trees shall be placed such that full shape and height will be reached without trimming, cutting or altering. For example: a large shade tree (height over 40 feet) placed near or under a power line shall not be allowed.
(12)
Trees shall not to be planted within ten feet of any existing or proposed natural gas or sanitary sewer lines and within five feet of any other existing or proposed underground utilities.
(Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015)
Sec. 62-38. - Receiving a building permit or certificate of occupancy.
(a)
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the city arborist has conducted the final inspection.
(b)
Due to the restricted tree planting period (October 1 to April 15) an allowance is made for activities to be completed during the non-tree planting time. A bond or an irrevocable letter of credit may be posted with the city arborist which will allow the applicant to occupy or use the development before all requirements of this division are met. An example letter of credit shall be furnished by the city attorney upon request.
(1)
The amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be $300.00 per required tree density unit.
(2)
In no event shall a bond or irrevocable letter of credit be for a time period of longer than seven months.
(3)
A bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be accepted only during the time of April 1 to October 1.
(4)
A request for an extension of an existing bond or irrevocable letter of credit may only be done through the appeal process. A request for an extension appeal application does not exempt the bond or letter of credit from the original termination date of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit.
