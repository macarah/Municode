ARTICLE IV. - SIGN REGULATIONS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 21-124, § 1(Exh. A), adopted August 24, 2021, amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. IV, §§ 4-71—4-81, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 15-111, §§ 1, 2(Exh. A), adopted April 28, 2015.

Sec. 4-71. - Statement of purpose.
In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the mayor and board of commissioners of the City of Albany not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to:
(a)
Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(b)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning;
(c)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
(d)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(e)
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city;
(f)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(g)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(h)
Promote economic development and tourism;
(i)
Protect private property values; and
(j)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and board of commissioners of the city have carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests. These decisions include: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A.11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power the power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics are a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to, and should be accorded, weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs are a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within its territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

If, upon inspection, it is determined that the roof sign is not structurally sound, the engineer shall list the structural deficiencies and the actions which must be taken to correct the structural deficiencies.
