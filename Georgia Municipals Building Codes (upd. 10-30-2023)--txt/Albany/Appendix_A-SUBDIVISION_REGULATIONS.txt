Phased development. Where large scale developments are proposed, the developer may choose to complete the project in phases. This can be done by the submission of a General Development Plan (GDP), which encourages the developer to perform comprehensive land planning while allowing the costs of detailed site engineering to be incurred on a phase by phase basis (see Illustration 3).
(1)
Application procedures.
a.
An applicant requesting approval of a GDP shall submit to the planning staff 20 copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter and a polyester film reproducible together with a completed application form and the stipulated fee.
b.
The application shall be reviewed and commented on by the full staff. Copies of the application and related information shall be furnished to the full staff by planning staff within seven days of the date of certification of a complete application. Written review comments from the full staff shall be returned to the planning staff within 14 days of the date of certification of a complete application.
c.
Review and action for approval of a GDP shall be handled by the planning commission. Action should be taken on this application within 35 days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.
(2)
Effect of approval of general development plan.
a.
An approved GDP is designed to serve as a guide for the applicant's preparation of and the planning commission's review of future preliminary plats. Approval of a GDP grants the following nonvested rights, which are presumed to be valid for ten years subject to engineering and environmental considerations:
1.
The location and general nature of infrastructure such as streets and utilities.
2.
The total number of residential dwelling units by type (i.e., detached single-family, town-houses, garden apartments, etc.) and/or the amount and type of nonresidential floor area (i.e., commercial, office, industrial, etc.)
3.
The general location and density of these uses within the proposed development.
4.
The nature of the proposed phases of development.
b.
Each phase of the development shall be separately granted preliminary and final approval pursuant to major subdivision review procedures. Each section of a phased development must be planned and constructed in such a way that adheres to the GDP concept and meets all design standards. Also, each phase must be able to exist independently and effectively if no further phases are completed.
c.
The planning commission may approve preliminary plats of phases with slight deviations from the GDP, but may require the submission of a revised GDP if the changes are determined to significantly affect the character or performance of the development.
d.
The planning commission may grant the rights referred to above in subsections a. through c. for such period of time longer than ten years that it determines to be reasonable.
(g)
Recordation.
(1)
Plats. The clerk of the superior court shall not file or record a final plat of a subdivision, as defined within these regulations, until such plat has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and signed by the planning director. The planning staff shall be responsible for the delivering of final plats to the clerk of the superior court for recordation and shall accomplish such delivery with the next full working day after all required signatures have been affixed to the plat.
(2)
Deed of conveyance. A deed transferring title of streets, easements and other designated areas shall be submitted to the appropriate commission for their acceptance. These deeds may be submitted upon preliminary approval for acceptance by the commission conditioned upon approval of the improvements by the city engineer or the county public works director as appropriate.
(h)
Administrative subdivision procedures.
(1)
Approval of administrative subdivisions.
a.
An application requesting approval of an administrative subdivision as defined by this chapter shall submit to the planning commission three copies and one polyester film reproducible of plat information and copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter, together with a completed application form and the stipulated fee.
b.
Review and actions for an administrative subdivision shall be handled by the planning director. Actions shall be taken within four days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. Failure to act shall constitute approval.
c.
The planning director shall notify the planning commission of actions taken on administrative subdivisions within 28 days of the action.
d.
Actions of the staff may be appealed to the planning commission. An applicant requesting an appeal of the actions of the full staff shall submit to the planning commission staff ten copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter within 14 days of the action. Such appeals will be acted on by the planning commission within 28 days of the filing of the appeal.

Secs. 25-10—25-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 25-21. - General provisions.
Subdivision development shall be in conformity with the following design and improvement standards. With regard to roadway, drainage, and utility requirements, alternate design standards may be approved by the planning commission, city engineer, the county director of public works, engineering director of water, gas and light commission, or director of traffic engineering; however, such changes shall be in accordance with sound engineering practices and for the purpose of addressing hardship and unsafe conditions which would result under the strict applications of the requirements of these regulations.
(Code 1985, § 25-21; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, A), 6-22-1993)
Sec. 25-22. - General design standards.
The subdivision of land including the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets, alleys, cross-walks, easements, sites for parks, playgrounds, and schools or other land to be dedicated for public use shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the city and the county. Approval of the design of a proposed subdivision shall be considered on the basis of its relation to existing and platted streets, reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjacent land, topographic conditions, run-off of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and appropriate relation to the proposed land uses of the areas to be served.
(1)
Size and shape of land to be subdivided.
a.
The size and shape of the land to be subdivided shall be sufficient and proper for land planning purposes and suitable in area and dimensions for the uses intended.
b.
The plans for the subdivision of the property should incorporate into, and be compatible with, the existing and potential uses on property contiguous to the area to be subdivided.
(2)
Design compatibility with natural features.
a.
The design of every subdivision shall be compatible with the existing topography, drainage patterns, and other natural features on the site.
b.
The design of every subdivision should conserve, wherever possible, isolated mature trees, wooded areas, watercourses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historical landmarks, and other features of the property, which, if preserved, would add to the attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood, or the city/county as a whole.
(3)
Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically or in spelling the name of any other subdivision previously approved and/or recorded, except where the subdivision is a phase or addition of a large or existing development or is a resubdivision of a previously recorded subdivision. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve the name of the subdivision and phase or addition number.
(4)
Lots.
a.
Political boundaries. In general, lots shall be laid out so that they do not cross any political boundary. However, if a proposed subdivision is so located as to require or is proposed to have access provided through another county or is to be located partially within either the county or the city and partially within some other jurisdiction, the subdivider shall provide the planning commission with official assurances from such other jurisdictions that such access is, in fact, on a public thoroughfare.
b.
Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with these city/county regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved public or private street.
c.
Lot specifications.
1.
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance and the health department in areas not served by public water and sewer.
2.
In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule shall provide a better street or lot plan.
3.
The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance.
4.
In general, if there are easements down side lot lines of individual lots in a subdivision and a building site consists of more than one lot, the easement down the middle of interior lot line is voided or removed unless there has been some utility construction placed within the easement and the utility easement is relocated down the new property line. An administrative subdivision shall be filed removing the center lot line.
5.
Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have a minimum width and depth required to provide an adequate building site while providing front, side, and rear yards as required in the zoning ordinance. As required in the city/county floodplain management ordinance, the building finished floor elevation shall be one foot above the flood level as measured from the 100-year floodwater line.
d.
Access.
1.
All lots shall abut a public or approved private street as permitted by the provisions of these regulations.
2.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major or minor arterial streets or highways or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
3.
All subdivisions containing lots fronting on state highways shall be submitted to the department of transportation for approval.
4.
Single business enterprises and multiple business developments considered to be high-traffic generators shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites.
e.
Driveway location.
1.
Driveways shall be located so that there is adequate clear sight distance onto the abutting road, avoiding locations along the inside curve or below the crown of a hilltop on an arterial street.
f.
Flag lots. Flag lots shall be allowed as follows:
1.
Where the flag lot makes it possible to better utilize irregularly shaped properties or areas with resource limitations.
2.
The "pole" portion of a flag lot shall be included as part of the lot area for the purpose of determining average lot area, and the "pole" shall have a minimum width at the street right-of-way of not less than 30 feet, provided that, where flag lots are used, there shall be at least two lots at any point of access for a total minimum joint frontage of 60 feet.
3.
Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of driveways taking access to a collector or arterial road. Shared driveways shall be used to eliminate additional points of access. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the developmental costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots, even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads. The shared driveway cut shall be provided by the developer and the driveway shall be constructed to the minimum depth necessary to serve all lots prior to recording the plat.
4.
Minimum lot area for flag lots shall be at least twice that of the zoning district in which the flag lot is located, except in the AG district where the minimum lot size shall remain ten acres.
5.
Side and rear yard requirements shall be met on the lot excluding the "pole" portion of the lot.
6.
The maximum length of the "pole" portion of the lot shall be no more than five times the lot width measured at the building line. This may be greater due to unusual circumstances when approved by the planning commission.
7.
A minimum frontage of 30 feet shall apply to lots which front upon the turn-around portion of a cul-de-sac.
(5)
Blocks.
a.
Design.
1.
The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following:
i.
Provisions for adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of uses contemplated.
ii.
The size requirements of lot size within the applicable zoning district.
iii.
Need for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of the street traffic.
2.
Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, water-courses, drainageways, or other property lines of the subdivision.
3.
No block should exceed 1,800 feet in length except where required by unusual topographic conditions.
4.
In blocks exceeding 1,200 feet in length, the planning commission may require a 20 foot-wide right-of-way or easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, and/or a paved sidewalk.
(Code 1985, § 25-22; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, B), 6-22-1993; Ord. No. 94-133, § 1, 6-29-1994; Ord. No. 94-158, § 1, 10-11-1994; Ord. No. 97-131, § 1, 7-8-1997; Ord. No. 99-137, 12-14-1999)
Sec. 25-23. - Streets.
(a)
General standards.
(1)
All streets. All streets in the subdivision shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system as established on the DARTS plan and comprehensive plan of the city and the county.
(2)
Major elements. Major elements of the street system should be used to help define and buffer different land use areas, enhancing their identity and cohesiveness.
(3)
Minimize length, intersections and paved area. To the extent feasible, the lineal length of streets, the number of street intersections, and the paved area within intersections should be minimized.
(4)
The design of the street system. The design of the street system of the subdivisions shall be in accordance with table I-A and I-B—minimum standards for street design and construction—and shall be in accordance with the engineering standards herein.
(5)
Adequate drainage structures. Adequate drainage structures shall be provided. The design, installation, and construction of drainage structures shall comply with the engineering standards herein and the city and the county floodplain management ordinance.
(6)
Private streets. Private streets shall be permitted if they have an alignment and width consistent with engineering and planning commission recommendations, have adequate easements for utilities and access and are local in nature and designed to prevent through traffic. Prior to final plan approval, the applicant shall file a release of maintenance agreement with the city/county attorney, releasing the relevant governing body from any present or future maintenance of all private streets. The perpetual maintenance of private streets shall be guaranteed by the establishment of a homeowners' association, other responsible association, or other instrument. In all cases, the instrument of street maintenance shall be approved by the planning commission. When built, private streets shall have signs posted indicating they are private streets. If, in the future, the property owners desire the streets to become public, they shall be improved to existing city/county standards prior to acceptance by the governing body. Private street design and construction standards shall be submitted to the city/county engineer for approval. In no case shall land reserved for right-of-way be less than required for a similar public street, nor shall the road width be less than required for a public road of similar classification.
(7)
Private access drives. Private access drives shall be permitted to serve landlocked lots only where landlocked lots were in existence prior to the enactment of these regulations or are a result of special physical features that otherwise render the property undevelopable. No more than one such drive shall be approved per subdivision development and must be approved as part of the original plat.
(8)
Listed thoroughfares. Listed thoroughfares to which driveway access is restricted or limited by these regulations are included in appendix 2 and regulated as follows:
a.
Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the thoroughfares listed in appendix 2, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed thoroughfares except in the cases of:
1.
Subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land; in which case, minimum frontages are to be as close to that required by exception 3. below as practical; however, when such frontage cannot be met, the planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the county director of public works or such person as may be directed to act as the county traffic engineer, approve lesser frontages and driveway spacing as low as that permitted in exception 4. below;
2.
When there are particular and unusual physical conditions not caused by the owner which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience;
3.
Where any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 200 feet and only one driveway per lot; or
4.
Where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 200 feet for all corner lots and 150 feet for all noncorner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line.
Generally, this would mean that lots should not front said listed thoroughfares; however, any design solution which satisfies the intent of restricting direct vehicular access to such thoroughfares would be acceptable. Potential design solutions to achieve this purpose include:
i.
Use of marginal access streets wherein land abutting a listed thoroughfare is separated from such thoroughfare by a planted or grassed strip of land and a marginal access street;
ii.
Use of reverse frontage lots wherein lots back up to a listed thoroughfare and front on and have access only to a local or minor collector street running approximately parallel to the listed thoroughfare. Such reverse frontage lots shall have a no-access reservation (at least 15 feet wide) along their rear property line and immediately adjacent to any abutting listed thoroughfare;
iii.
Using one or more cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets wherein lots front and only have access to such streets and those streets are only entered from and generally designed at right angles to a street not a listed thoroughfare and laid out approximately parallel to any listed thoroughfare; and
iv.
Other such design solutions as may be devised to achieve the same results. The use of deep lots with rear service alleys and a no access reservation along the front of the lot or the use of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets having direct access to a listed thoroughfare is not considered a good solution and should be approved only when unique circumstances make other solutions unacceptable.
Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain a listed thoroughfare, the planning commission may require the use of such design standards as listed above.
b.
Any lot on a designated listed thoroughfare but not a state highway which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall be reviewed and approved as a business use property.
c.
Single business enterprise on a single lot on a "listed thoroughfare."
1.
Traffic movements confined primarily to on-site employees of any type business of no more than 40 employees are permitted driveways as follows:
i.
Corner lots. One two-way on the principle thoroughfare and one two-way on the cross street; or
ii.
Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways.
2.
Traffic movements consisting primarily of in-and-out customer activities with any type business except service stations and convenience stores with gas and characteristics shall be permitted driveways as indicated below:
i.
No more than 50 on-site parking spaces or are located on sites of less than 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows:
aa.
Corner lots. One two-way driveway on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or
bb.
Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways.
ii.
More than 50 on-site parking spaces and are on sites having a minimum of 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows:
aa.
Corner lot. Two two-way driveways on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or
bb.
Interior lot. Two two-way driveways.
cc.
Service stations and convenience stores which include gas and oil sales and have a minimum frontage of 150 feet shall be permitted no more than one curb opening for each 50 feet of frontage or major fraction thereof along any street.
No driveway or curb opening shall be located nearer than ten feet to any corner or exterior lot line, as measured along the property line. No driveway shall be located nearer than 30 feet, as measured along the property line, to any other driveway giving access to or from the same service station.
cc [dd.]
In all cases, driveways are to be located as far as practical from an inter-section.
d.
Multiple businesses on either corner or interior lots or tracts on a "listed thoroughfare." The following applies to as many said thoroughfares as the property borders and any business use.
1.
Sites with up to 300 feet of frontage are permitted one two-way driveway or two one-way driveways.
2.
Sites with more than 300 feet and up to 1,000 feet of frontage are permitted two two-way driveways.
3.
Sites with more than 1,000 feet and up to 2,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways.
4.
Sites with more than 2,000 feet and up to 3,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways or two one-way driveways and one multilaned driveway.
5.
Sites with more than 3,000 feet of frontage will be permitted driveways on a case-by-case basis upon study and recommendation of the person designated to act as the county traffic engineer and/or state traffic and safety engineer as appropriate.
In the above instances (1.—5.), driveways of corner lots or tracts shall be as far as practical from the intersection.
h. [6.]
(Driveway access for listed streets in the city, not under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Transportation (GDOT), is regulated by h(5)[e.]—(9)[i.]. Listed streets within the Central Business District are exempt from these regulations.)
(e) [e.]
Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the urban principal or minor arterials listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed urban principal or minor arterials. Access must be from an interior local street or frontage street.
The planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the city Engineer, allow direct access to listed principal or minor arterials under the following conditions:
(a)
Subdivision of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land;
(b)
When there are particular and unusual physical conditions, not caused by the owner, which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
The following minimum frontages for listed urban principal or minor arterials are allowed if the planning commission grants direct access based on (a) or (b) above; any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 450 feet and only one driveway per lot; or where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 300 feet for all corner lots and 250 feet for all non-corner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways, or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line.
(f) [f.]
Subdivision of property on a listed urban principal or minor arterial, which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall follow access requirements outlined in (7) for commercial and industrial subdivisions.
(g) [g.]
Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain an urban principal or minor arterial listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix A.
(h) [h.]
Where any lot abuts or contains a collector listed in appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix 4.
(i) [i.]
An appeal for additional access for (7) and (8) above must be made to the city engineering department according to that department's procedure.
(9)
Improvement plan and grading requirements. Streets shall be graded and improved to conform to the city and county construction standards and engineering specifications and shall be approved as to design and constructions by the city engineer and the county director of public works.
(10)
Alleys. Alleys may be required in high density residential, commercial and industrial developments. Where provided, alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way (ROW) width of 25 feet and a minimum pavement width of 20 feet. (See table I-A, I-B—minimum standards for street designs.)
(11)
Dead-end streets (temporary). If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary line of the property being subdivided. A temporary turnaround of a design approved by the city engineer and the the county director of public works shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land required outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting owners whenever the street is continued.
(12)
Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs in residential areas should not be longer than 1,800 feet, but may be approved for longer lengths depending on design constraints. Cul-de-sacs may be built with standard circular turnarounds or with standard circular turnarounds with center islands. If a cul-de-sac is built with standard circular turnaround with center island, the island shall be landscaped with grass or trees and maintained by a homeowners association. All dead-end streets shall be provided with a cul-de-sac.
(13)
Sight triangles (clear sight distance). Where any street intersection is created which would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the sight triangle, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance requirements of these regulations and shall not erect any sign or improvement which would preclude safe sight distance.
(14)
Curb and gutter.
a.
Where curb and gutter are constructed, vertical curb shall be used on all collector streets. Mountable (rolled) curb may be used on local streets if its use does not adversely affect storm drainage, if approved by the city engineer. (Design specifications for curb are contained in the appropriate jurisdiction's constructions specifications).
b.
Where provided, curb and gutter shall be constructed based on city/county construction standards and specifications.
(15)
Roadside ditches. Where curb and gutter is not provided, drainage ditches shall be constructed to provide for proper drainage. Drainage ditches shall have side slopes no steeper than 3:1, and shall be grassed and mulched, sodded, or paved depending on the intended design velocity of stormwater. Drainage ditch construction shall conform to the specifications detailed in applicable city/county construction standards.
(16)
Utility areas. Utilities shall generally be located within the right-of-way and/or easements on both sides of and parallel to the street in accordance with table I-A, I-B. Utility areas shall be planted with grass or ground cover or treated with other suitable cover material.
(17)
Street names and signs. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of existing streets. Therefore, developers are required to submit their proposed street names to the planning commission. Duplication of street names between the city and county are not to occur except where a street is planned as a continuation of a street between the two jurisdictions. A street which exists or is planned as a continuation of a street shall bear the same name. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve street names in new subdivisions. At least two street name signs shall be placed at each four-way intersection and one at each "T" intersection. Signs shall be free of visual obstructions. Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the city or county. These shall be paid for by the subdivider prior to the recording of the final plat.
(18)
House numbers/street addresses. House numbers or street addresses shall be provided by the planning commission after preliminary plat approval and a copy of the final plat showing the approved house numbers or street addresses shall be submitted along with the final plat. The planning staff may approve minor corrections or modifications at final review.
(19)
Reserve strips. The creation of fee simple reserve strips to preclude access shall not be permitted. Streets roughly parallel to the boundary line of the subdivision shall be located either on that boundary line or not less than one lot depth from said boundary line. All streets intended to provide the subdivision and adjacent parcels of property with means of ingress and egress shall extend to the boundary line of the subdivision.
(b)
Design criteria. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and to avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards are hereby required. The following design criteria are ideal standards that should be the goal of all design. However, specific site conditions may dictate these goals to be unattainable. In such cases, flexibility will be allowed.
(c)
Design layout.
(1)
General concepts.
a.
All streets shall be located in relation to existing topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to efficient drainage and utility systems.
b.
All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industrial business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to patterns of existing and proposed land uses.
(2)
Residential streets.
a.
A residential area should be conveniently accessible from arterial streets.
b.
Residential streets shall provide safe and convenient access to housing.
c.
Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage high speed or through traffic, but the design shall be logical and comprehensive to a motorist or a pedestrian attempting to travel to and through the subdivision.
d.
Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or looped streets shall be used where such will result in a more desirable layout.
e.
Layout of residential areas should be planned to avoid future need to widen any local streets or minor collector streets.
(3)
Nonresidential streets.
a.
Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended through adjacent existing or potential residential areas.
b.
The streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
c.
Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should:
1.
Be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure depth for commercial or industrial sites, and
2.
Be at a distance at least 50 feet from the railroad right-of-way when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary, when intersecting a street which will be grade separated when crossing the railroad.
(4)
Design speeds for streets. Part of the criteria to be used in the layout and design of streets shall be the following vehicular speed design factors:
EXPAND
Arterial 45—55 miles-per-hour
Major collector* 40—45 miles-per-hour
Minor collector* 30—45 miles-per-hour
Local 25—30 miles-per-hour
  *The lower speed within the range shown shall apply specifically to residential areas while commercial and industrial area streets may use the full speed range depending on specific requirements of the development.
NOTE—The above vehicular speed design factors shall not necessarily be used to establish speed limits.
(5)
Intersections.
a.
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case shall any intersection be less than 75 degrees. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one 100 feet therefrom.
b.
Intersections on the inside of a curve, on a hilltop, or a point slightly below a hilltop shall be avoided.
c.
An intersection of more than two streets shall not be permitted without approval of the planning staff, traffic engineer, city engineer or the county public works director.
d.
In nonresidential areas and along arterial streets, proposed new intersections shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any intersections on the opposite side of such street.
e.
In cases of intersection off-sets, centerline jogs of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted whenever possible; however, major streets should be aligned to avoid off-sets altogether.
(d)
A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established wherever feasible along "listed thoroughfares," and the building site shall incorporate the following:
(1)

Spacing of Driveways. Guidelines for driveway spacing, associated with the construction of new driveways, are provided in Table I—Driveway Spacing Criteria. Driveways should be separated from any other facility, which accesses a city roadway, whether it is another driveway or a public street.
Spacing of One-Way Driveways. Figure 1 shows a typical layout of one-way driveways. The spacing criteria presented in Table I does not apply to the distance between the two (2) one-way driveways (driveway pair).
A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in Table I. A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in Table I.
