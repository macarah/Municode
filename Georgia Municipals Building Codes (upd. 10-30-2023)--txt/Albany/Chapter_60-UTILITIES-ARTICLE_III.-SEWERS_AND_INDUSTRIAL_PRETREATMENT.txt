When the building sewer is not located at the property line and the city public works department has to make additional trips to reference the tap, the additional cost will be billed to the person responsible for demolition.
c.
Reuse of existing taps. Taps will be reused by the next occupant provided the tap is in good condition and sufficient in size, as determined by the superintendent of the sewer systems division. The tap reuse fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners from time to time, and made available for public examination in the offices of the public works department and the city clerk, will be assessed.
d.
Locations subject to backup conditions. At locations where backups are known or are expected to occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing the installation of a manhole containing a plug valve and a check valve for backflow prevention. Where backups are known to occur, the city will provide all equipment and labor to make the installation if the property owner will furnish all materials.
At undeveloped locations where the director of engineering has reason to believe back-up conditions may occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing that the owner make the installation of the manhole and valves at the owner's expense. Subsequent flooding damages will not be the responsibility of the city if the owner does not make the installation. If the owner later experiences backup conditions, the owner will pay the total cost, if he or she desires to have the backflow prevention installed.

Sec. 60-136. - Sewer extension policy.
(a)
Existing development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer if an existing septic tank or private sewer fails. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charge, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work shall be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge.
(b)
New development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charges, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work would be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge.
(c)
Areas not served by city sewer can obtain city sewer service in one of the following ways:
(1)
Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property, property owners within the city limits may petition the city for sewer service. All property owners to be affected by the sewer extension would be notified of the petition by certified mail and would have 30 days to vote for or against the project. If 51 percent or more of the property owners to be affected are in favor of the project, the city commission by a majority vote could pass an ordinance to do the work and assess all property owners to be served by the extension.
(2)
Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property located within the city limits, the city commission can pass an ordinance after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, with a majority vote to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension.
(3)
Provided capacity is available and sewer service is located more than 1,000 feet from unserved property located within the city limits, but based on the existing development patterns and/or the existing land use map, the development density in the service area of the sewer extension is or could be 3.25 units per acre, the city commission may pass an ordinance, after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension.
(4)
A developer of property, inside the city limits, can submit plans to the director of engineering for approval to extend sewer service to a new development such as a subdivision. Sewer shall be extended to the limits of the property to allow future developments access to sewer. Upon approval of plans, the developer can hire a contractor, provided capacity is available to extend the sewer. Developer would pay for all costs with installing sewer within a new subdivision. Taps would be installed to the lots by the contractor. All development charges would be paid as building permits are issued. The city will pay for increased capacity, extra depth or increased pipe size if the director of engineering determines it necessary.
(5)
Provided capacity is available, the county can request the city to provide sewer service to an unserved area located in the unincorporated part of the county. The county would pay the city for all costs of construction and all other associated costs. A sewer development charge would also be due as building permits are issued.

DIVISION 3. - USE REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 60-194. - Prohibited discharge standards.
(a)
General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(b)
Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
(1)
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
(2)
Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;

Sec. 60-195. - National categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR ch. 1, subch. N, §§ 403—471 are hereby incorporated.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
a.
Industrial user must develop a pilot testing program at the POTW. This program will include a pilot unit or a prototype treatment plant, of reasonable scale, to conduct treatment of actual influent wastewater, spiked with proportional synthetic mass quantities of expected concentration of the concerned contaminant.
b.
User will present to the city a pilot testing program (PTP) plan with the following requirements:
1.
A detailed description of the objectives of the PTP plan. Those objectives must be identified early in the planning process for the city's review.
2.
Plan should also include:
(i)
Extent of user's process problem related to permit's constituent limits.
(ii)
Objectives of proposed process change or constituent level variance.
(iii)
Design and operation plan of PTP plan.
(iv)
Implementation schedule.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

Sec. 60-196. - Local limits.
(a)
The City of Albany Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) is designed to handle conventional organic pollutants derived from domestic discharges. The plant can also handle non-toxic organic loads to a certain degree. The city allows non-domestic users to discharge conventional pollutants such as five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ), total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in levels that do not offset the WPCP operation. Non-domestic users that discharge these pollutants are required to pay an additional user fee to the city on the basis of mass quantities (i.e., for every pound of BOD 5 and TSS) discharged to the sewer system. Therefore, the non-domestic users have the option to decide if it is more economical for them to install a pre-treatment system to reduce the BOD 5 and TSS loads or to pay the city the user fees to treat the wastewater loads at the WPCP. However, if any non-domestic user discharges conventional pollutants that may cause pass through and interference, then specific limits will be set by the city on a case-by-case basis. Non-domestic users that have a valid written discharge permit from the city will have specific requirements for conventional pollutants in their permits. Non-domestic dischargers without a permit must comply with the following maximum limits of conventional pollutants:
EXPAND
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) Equals 2,500 mg/l
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) Equals 4,250 mg/l
Total dissolved solids (TDS) Equals 1,000 mg/l
Total suspended solids (TSS) Equals 2,000 mg/l
Oil and grease (O&G) Equals 100 mg/l

Sec. 60-387. - Treatment upsets.
(a)
Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operation that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the director of public works thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report thereof shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain:
(1)
A description of the upset, its cause and impact on the discharger's compliance status;
(2)
The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to be restored;
(3)
All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset.
(b)
An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions of this section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the director of public works for any noncompliance with this article, or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out of violations attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented and verified upset.
(c)
The affirmative defense shall be in accordance with the specifications presented in 40 CFR 403.16. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1)
An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset:
(2)
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
(3)
The industrial user has submitted the information described in subsection (a) of this section to the director of public works within the time limits specified therein.
(d)
In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e)
In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, city enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final city action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(f)
The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

The monthly sewer service charge for residential usage shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption of BOD and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March will be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months. For new residential billings with no consumption history, billing will be based on a consumption of 6,000 gallons per month. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department.
(5)
Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in the independent water supply subsection (d) of this section and the city sewer service charge shall be the applicable charge for industrial/commercial or residential usage.
(d)
Independent water supply; installation of meter. In the event a lot, parcel of land, premises or facility discharging sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the city's sewer system, or which ultimately enters the sewer system, is supplied either whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than the Albany Water, Gas, and Light Commission, then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission and, if the water from said wells or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his or her own cost, install and maintain a meter or meters on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by members of the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. In selected cases, certain industries may read and report these readings to Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission.
(e)
Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director of public works that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the sewer system, then the director of public works may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does enter the sewer system, and the corrected meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city.
(f)
More than one residential unit served by a single meter. When more than one residential unit is served by single meter, the sewer service charge shall consist of the base monthly charge for each unit plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption, BOD, and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March shall be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months.
(g)
Establishment of categories of industries and means of setting fees. Industries discharging less than 100,000 gallons per month may be grouped in categories according to SIC classification for the purpose of sampling and billing. A representative sample will be made of selected establishments within the category and an average sewage strength determined for that category. All establishments will then be billed for the amount of their discharge at the strengths determined for that category.
