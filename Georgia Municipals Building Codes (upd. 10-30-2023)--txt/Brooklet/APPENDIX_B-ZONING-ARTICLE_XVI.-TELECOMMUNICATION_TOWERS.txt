D.
To accommodate the increased demand for the development of towers and wireless telecommunication facilities; and
E.
To encourage the location of towers in non-residentially developed and zoned areas.
Sec. 16-2. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings given in this section:
A.
Alternative tower structures: shall include, but are not limited to, man-made structures such as clock towers, bell towers, church steeples, water towers, light poles, warehouses, factories, commercial buildings, multi-family buildings, and publicly-used structures such as police and fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, and other structures that can be used for the mounting of antennas or serving the function of a tower.
B.
Antenna: shall mean any exterior apparatus designed for the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
C.
Co-location/shared use: shall mean the placement of the antennas of two or more service providers upon a single tower.
D.
FAA: shall mean the Federal Aviation Administration.
E.
FCC: shall mean the Federal Communications Commission.
F.
Guy tower: shall mean the tower that is supported, in whole or in part, by guy wires and ground anchors.
G.
Height: shall mean the vertical distance of any tower as measured from the bottom of the base of the tower at ground level to the highest point of such tower, not including any antennas or other attachments.
H.
Lattice tower: shall mean a tower that has open-framed supports on three or four sides and is constructed without guy wires and ground anchors.
I.
Monopole tower: shall mean a telecommunications tower constructed of a single pole, without guy wires or ground anchors.
J.
Tower: shall mean a vertical structure on which is or can be located one or more antennas, including but not necessarily limited to guy towers, lattice towers, and monopole towers.
Sec. 16-3. - Co-location or location on alternative tower structure required; exception.
No new towers shall be permitted unless the applicant adequately demonstrates that neither an existing tower suitable for co-location nor a suitable alternative tower structure is available. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or other structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
A.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
B.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's requirements.
C.
Existing tower or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
D.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
E.
The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower developments are presumed unreasonable.
F.
Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs.
G.
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
Sec. 16-4. - Development standards.
A.
Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size requirements for zoning districts shall not apply to towers. However, the site or parcel on which the tower is located shall be of sufficient size to meet the minimum setback requirements in this article.
B.
Minimum setback requirements. Towers shall be set back a minimum of a distance equal to the height of the tower from all habitable buildings or structures, public rights-of-way, and property lines of any adjacent property. Monopole towers shall not be located any closer than the height of the tower to any residence. Guy towers and lattice towers shall not be located any closer than 500 feet or three times the height of the tower, whichever is greater, to any residence. These setback requirements shall not apply to any building related to the operation or maintenance of the tower.
C.
Structural design. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is designed, constructed, and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), as amended from time to time. A tower must have the structural capacity to accommodate at least two other users comparable to the initial user.
D.
Maximum height. The maximum height of towers in all residential districts shall be 180 feet. In all zoning districts in which towers are permitted as conditional use, the height of all towers may be limited in granting the conditional use permit. If at any time it is determined by the FAA or any successor agency that a tower or antenna is interfering with the operation of the Statesboro Municipal Airport or with the Statesboro Municipal Airport's ability to upgrade its status (such as to an instrument landing system facility), such tower or antenna shall immediately be modified to eliminate such interference. If the tower or antenna cannot be modified to eliminate the interference, then the tower or antenna shall immediately be removed by the owner. If the owner fails to remove such tower or antenna, then the governing authority may remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense and the cost of removal shall constitute a lien upon the property on which the tower or antenna was located.
E.
Illumination. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the zoning administrator, planning and zoning commission, or board of commissioners may review the available lighting alternatives approved by the FAA or any successor agency and require the alternative that would cause the least disturbance to surrounding property: This may include the requirement of a dual lighting system, vertical aiming, or such other FAA-approved measures as may be feasible to reduce the negative impact on the surrounding property. Additional expense shall not be a factor in determining feasibility.
F.
Color and markings. Unless otherwise required by the FAA or other applicable authority, all towers shall be unmarked and shall have either a galvanized finished or be painted a dull blue, gray, or black finish. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the zoning administrator may require the antenna and related equipment or appurtenances to be of a neutral color that is compatible with the color of the supporting structures so as to make the antenna and related equipment or appurtenances as visually unobtrusive as possible. Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
G.
Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. For guy towers, each guy anchor shall also be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height with the fence line set back at least ten feet from the guy anchor.
H.
Landscaping. The visual impact of towers shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures as follows:
(1)
A landscaped buffer area a minimum of ten feet in width shall be maintained around the exterior of the security fencing.
(2)
The landscaped buffer area shall consist of materials of the evergreen variety sufficient to provide screening that will minimize the visual impact of the tower.
(3)
All required landscaping shall be properly maintained to ensure good health and vitality.
(4)
The use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be credited as appropriate toward meeting landscaping requirements.
(5)
Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
(6)
Applicants may submit for approval alternative landscaping plans that meet the purposes of this subsection to limit the visual impact of towers. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
(7)
The zoning administrator is authorized to grant any approvals and/or waivers contemplated by this subsection in zoning districts where towers are a permitted use.
I.
No advertising. Neither the tower nor the tower site shall be used for advertising purposes and shall not contain any signs for the purpose of advertising. Name plates for the purpose of self-identification shall not be considered advertising.
J.
Federal and state requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal or state governments with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency.
K.
Pre-existing towers/non-conforming uses. All towers operative on the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use or structure. Additional antennas and related equipment or appurtenances may be co-located on or around pre-existing towers, provided that a permit for such co-location is obtained in accordance with this article.
Sec. 16-5. - Application procedures.
A.
Building permits. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity who has not made application for and obtained a building permit in accordance with this article to:
(1)
Erect, construct in place, re-erect, or replace, any tower;
(2)
Locate or co-locate any telecommunications facilities on or around a pre-existing tower for which a permit has not been obtained in accordance with this article;
(3)
Locate any telecommunications facilities on an alternative tower structure.
No permit or informational submittals shall be required for the repair, replacement, or addition of antenna(s) to a tower or alternative tower structure that does not involve the installation of equipment or appurtenances other than the antenna(s) not exceeding 20 feet in height. No additional permit shall be required for the co-location of an antenna or antennas and related equipment or appurtenances on or around a tower for which a permit has already been issued in accordance with this article; provided, however, that the co-locating person or entity shall make information submittals as hereinafter required. Applications for building permits and information submittals under this article shall be submitted to the zoning administrator or his designee and shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk.
