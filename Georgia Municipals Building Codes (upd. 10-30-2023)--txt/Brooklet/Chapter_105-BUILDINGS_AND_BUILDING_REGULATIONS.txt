The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system;

The provisions of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes do not apply to this specific case;
(3)
That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case; or
(4)
The true intent and meaning of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted.
(b)
Variances. The construction board of adjustment and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing code or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others;
(2)
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to other buildings, structures or service system;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
(c)
Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the building, gas, mechanical and plumbing codes. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of these codes.

Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 calendar days after the decision is rendered by the building official. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building official.

Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure or service system that, in the opinion of the building official, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such appeals to a shorter period.
Sec. 105-155. - Procedures of the board.
(a)
Rules and regulations. The board shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing code.

Decisions. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall, in each case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay.

If the decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the building official or varies the application of any provision of the building, gas, mechanical or plumbing code, the building official shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. Every decision shall be promptly filed, in writing, in the office of the building official and shall be open to public inspection. A certified copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant and a copy shall be kept publicly posted in the office of the building official for two weeks after the filing.
