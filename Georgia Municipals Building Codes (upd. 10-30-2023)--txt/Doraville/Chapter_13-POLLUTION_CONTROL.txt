Sec. 13-13. - Same—Submission of plans for approval.
(a)
A two-stage alarm system is required for each tank within the City receiving petroleum products from a pipeline transportation company. The high-level alarm shall serve as a warning. The high-level shutdown alarm will signal the pipeline transportation company to immediately shut down delivery to the tank. Both the high-level alarm and the high-level shutdown alarm must signal both the terminal operations and the pipeline operations delivery points. Audible outside alarms shall be established so that they can be heard anywhere on the premises of the company operating the storage tank.
(b)
The equipment and methods of operation are required to be simple and high quality equipment. The National Electrical Code and the local and state electrical codes shall govern the electrical design.
(c)
All equipment must be such as can be easily maintained and accessible. The following requirements must be provided and furnished to the pipelines:
(1)
Interconnection of pipeline pumping control facilities and terminal tank facilities will utilize compatible systems and equipment. Systems and equipment will be subject to approval of the City engineer prior to the installation.
(2)
Separate circuits are required for the two (2) types products delivered to the tanks, namely, gasoline and distillates, where simultaneous delivery of such products is possible. A single circuit may be used to each pipeline company that transmits the alarm signals, provided the two (2) types of alarms can be sent simultaneously. Any violation of this section, as amended, shall be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-12 of the Municipal Code of the City.
(3)
Alarms shall be made only to the pipeline making a delivery.
(4)
The pipelines shall not cancel any alarm received. Receiving terminals (shippers) shall be responsible for rectifying and thereby canceling any and all alarms.
(5)
The high-level alarm shall be set so as to allow twelve (12) minutes from the time of the alarm until tank overflow at the maximum receiving rate. Unless notification to the contrary is given from the terminal operator to the pipeline, shutdown will be started two (2) minutes after the pipeline's receipt of the high-level alarm.
(6)
The high-level shutdown alarm must be set to alarm five (5) minutes before the tank will overflow at the maximum receiving rate. Upon receipt of the high-level shutdown alarm the pipeline company shall immediately shut down its delivery of products to the terminal.
(7)
Cancellation of the alarm signal from a terminal to a pipeline by the terminal operator must be made by closing a limit switch on the respective tank fill valve, or by reducing the level of product in the tank or tanks in the "alarm" condition.
(8)
Upon receipt of a high-level shutdown alarm the terminal when pumping from one (1) tank to another will likewise shut down pumping to the tank in the alarm condition.
(9)
Silencing of any stage audible alarm at a terminal annunciator shall not cancel the alarm to the pipeline.
(10)
All systems shall be "fail safe" in that the alarm relay shall be energized at all times. An alarm condition will interrupt power from a terminal to a pipeline and sound an alarm.
(11)
All alarm testing shall be confirmed in a written document maintained at each facility where such testing occurs and the same shall be open for review by the City of Doraville. To further support terminal alarm testing documentation, the terminals will be responsible for test alarm reconciliation between the individual terminals and pipelines and the same shall be noted in the permanent document maintained at the facility. The pipelines shall also send to each terminal test results weekly from alarm tests.
