(3)
Amateur radio: Receive-only antenna: This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under seventy (70) feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
(4)
Pre-existing towers and antennas: This section shall apply with respect to any subsequent changes, modifications, collocations or replacements to a pre-existing cell tower or antenna. Any such cell towers or antennas shall be referred to in this section as "pre-existing towers" or "pre-existing antennas."
(c)
General guidelines and requirements:
(1)
Purpose: Goals: The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the sitting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to:
(i)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(ii)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(iii)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(iv)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
(v)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
(2)
Principal or accessory use: Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the small lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. The lot upon which antennas and towers shall be is a lot which contains not less than five hundred (500) square feet and the same shall be fenced or otherwise secured in a manner acceptable to the Mayor and Council.
(3)
Inventory of existing sites: Each applicant for any new antenna, including small cell technology, and/or telecommunication wireless support structure, shall provide to the mayor and council an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Mayor and Council may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or variances or special use permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided however, that the Mayor and Council is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
(4)
Aesthetics and lighting: The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this section; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive the requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby:
a.
Telecommunication wireless support structures, antennas and related equipment shall be painted in a neutral color identical to or closely compatible with the surroundings, and in such a manner as to make the structures, antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
b.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
c.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a telecommunication wireless support structure, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
d.
Telecommunication wireless support structures shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(5)
Federal requirements: All telecommunication wireless support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, to provide for new standards of safety or design geared towards increasing safety, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency, and so long as this requirement does not conflict with the provisions of the new standards and regulations. Failure to bring telecommunication wireless support structures and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute a violation of this section and grounds for enforcement of this section by all available means as authorized under federal, state or local law.
(6)
Building codes: Safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of cell towers, the owner of a cell tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the City concludes that a cell tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the structure, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such structure into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such structure into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the City shall enforce this subsection by all available means as authorized by federal, state or local law.
(7)
Distance restrictions: With the exception of small cell technology wireless support structures in the right-of-way, no cell tower shall be located closer than six hundred twenty-five (625) feet from any other cell tower as measured by a straight line between the two (2) structures.
