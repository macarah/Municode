ARTICLE XII. - PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 23-1201. - Parking and loading spaces required.
It is the intent of this article that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes.
Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition.
No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conforms to the regulations for parking and loading contained herein.
Sec. 23-1202. - General requirements.
Off-street parking spaces for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building to be served. Off-street parking spaces for uses other than single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be located more than three hundred (300) feet distant from such uses measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway.
Parking requirements for two (2) or more uses of the same or different types may be satisfied by the allocation of a common or collective parking facility. Such facility shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the individual uses computed separately in accordance with the requirements of this article, except that up to one-half (½) of the parking requirements for churches and similar places of public assembly may be satisfied by the parking areas of other dissimilar uses when the hours of operation are normally at different times of the day.
When multiple uses occupy a building, the parking and loading requirement shall be met by determining the percentage of the total building area devoted to each type of use and then applying the appropriate requirements by use.
For any use not listed, the City Council shall determine the proper requirement by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein as to assure equal treatment. In making any such determination, the City Council shall follow the principles set forth in the statement of purpose at the beginning of this section.
Sec. 23-1203. - Parking space calculations.
modified
The parking requirements of this article will permit the designation of compact car spaces. Compact car spaces may occupy up to twenty (20) percent of required parking spaces. If compact spaces are included as part of the parking requirement, each such space shall be clearly labeled on the ground.
