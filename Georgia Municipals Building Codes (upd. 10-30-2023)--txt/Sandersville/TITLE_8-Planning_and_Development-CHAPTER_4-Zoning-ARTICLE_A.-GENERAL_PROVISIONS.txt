modified
Heavy industry plants in I-2 districts shall have the right to engage in any activity necessary to maintain and expand that industry and shall have the right to engage in any activity to comply with any mandated state or federal legislation or agency. These rights shall exist for I-2, heavy industrial plants, even though specific rights may not be expressly indicated. The rights for activities and fixtures to maintain business and plant maintenance and/or to comply with state and federal regulations shall not be interpreted so as to grant these rights to activities or fixtures that are not necessary for maintenance of heavy industrial plants and shall not permit other businesses to locate in I-2 districts, solely because they engage in similar activities as an independent supplier to said heavy industries. These rights shall exist for contractors that are engaged in such activities for heavy industries on said industries' property.
