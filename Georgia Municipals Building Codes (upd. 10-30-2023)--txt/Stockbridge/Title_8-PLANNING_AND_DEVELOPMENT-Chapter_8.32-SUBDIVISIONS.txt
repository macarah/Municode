3.
A variety of methods of achieving stormwater management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:
a.
The type of development which the detention facility is being provided;
b.
The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect;

Topographic opportunities and limitations;
f.
Safety considerations;
g.
Maintenance requirements;
h.
Aesthetic considerations;
i.
Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities;
j.
Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc.; and
k.
Similar site-specific constraints.
4.
Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two (2) or more types may be used in combination with one another:
a.
Normally-dry basins, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods;
b.
Lakes and ponds, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods;
c.
Parking lot facilities;
d.
Underground facilities;
e.
Rooftop facilities.
5.
Plans, specifications and computations must be complete in detail sufficient to enable another engineer to fully check and verify the results and computations. The plans used for construction must contain basic design data, a project narrative, schedule of construction, name and address of person responsible for construction, the engineer's seal or stamp, signature and address and engineering drawings required for the project construction.
a.
The detention facility shall be provided with an overflow device or emergency spillway to accommodate the one hundred (100) year frequency storm in the event the outflow control structure becomes obstructed with debris.
b.
The configuration of the detention facility, outflow and overflow control devices shall be clearly depicted in plan and cross-section on the construction drawings.
c.
Graded access easement, (maximum six percent (6%) grade) around all detention ponds in areas inaccessible to vehicular traffic.
d.
Temporary sediment basins shall he designed and shown at all detention sites and all major drainage exits. The detention facility shall be designed to provide temporary silt protection.
e.
Underground detention facilities will require details that provide:
i.
The location and type of access protection for the detention facility,
ii.
An outline of maintenance procedures to be filed with the county,
iii.
Safety requirements as specified by the county for the site.
B.
As Constructed Certification of Detention Pond. After construction and before acceptance for occupation or otherwise the engineer shall submit a certified field run topographic map of the detention area and a revised hydrology study using the as-built topographic map to verify that the required detention storage and outflow rates are being provided.
C.
Detention Pond Fencing. When a detention structure is over four feet (4′) deep or in a location that constitutes a danger to human habitation, it shall be protected by a permanent fence or barrier and warning signs. Fences shall be five feet (5′) high chain link or other approved material with a ten-foot (10′) wide gate. Fences shall be located on the outside edge of the twenty-foot (20′) perimeter easement.
