Chapter 2 - ZONING AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS

2.1 - Generally.
All buildings, land, and structures shall be used in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the City of Stockbridge, and they shall comply with the development standards of the applicable zoning district which is established in this chapter. Such buildings, land, and structures shall be occupied or used only in conformity with each of the standards that are set forth herein for the district in which they are located.
2.2 - Official zoning map.
The City of Stockbridge is hereby divided into zoning districts, as is shown on the official zoning map, together with all explanatory notes thereon. The official zoning map may be amended according to procedures that are established in Chapter 2.
2.3 - Establishment of zoning districts.
The zoning districts which are established in this unified development code are comprised of base districts and overlay districts. The base zoning districts refer to "how a property is zoned," while the overlay districts are special areas of the city where additional regulations apply. Many properties in the city have overlay districts in addition to their base zoning districts, whereby properties must comply with the regulations of both districts. If there is any conflict between a property's base zoning district and its overlay district, the overlay district regulations shall rule.
Most properties that are located along the major roads within the City of Stockbridge are also located within the Parkway Mixed Use Overlay District. Please see the adopted overlay map to view these parcels. These properties therefore have two (2) zoning districts—a base zoning district and an overlay district. Each district is assigned development standards that regulate the use and development of property within the city limits of Stockbridge. Uses may be permitted "by right" with no further approvals required; uses may be subject to supplemental standards; and certain uses may be prohibited. The range of residential uses is presented in the respective residential zoning districts. Commercial, institutional, and industrial uses are presented in the respective nonresidential zoning districts. Accessory uses which are permitted in residential and nonresidential districts are presented in the individual zoning districts.
A.
List of Current Zoning Districts. Listed below are the City of Stockbridge's current zoning districts. They are grouped by base zoning districts and overlay districts. The base zoning districts are further grouped by residential districts, commercial districts, industrial districts, and other districts.

PUD—Planned Unit Development
  2.4.13 - PUD—Planned Unit Development District.
A.
District Intent. The intent of the Planned Unit Development District is to:
1.
Allow the development of balanced neighborhoods containing physical, economic, and social assets which are difficult to achieve through the traditional separation of use and density zones;
2.
Provide an appropriate district for mixed-use developments; and
3.
Allow flexibility in design for environmentally challenged properties.
New developments may contain two (2) or more types of uses. Traditional single-family detached subdivisions are envisioned to be in Suburban Residential Districts instead of PUD Districts, unless an unusual site design is proposed (such as cluster housing) or the physical characteristics of the property necessitate flexibility in the site design. Traditional multifamily developments are similarly envisioned to be in a Multiple Family Residential District rather than in a PUD District.
This is accomplished by allowing the applicant the freedom necessary to protect natural resources, to protect and improve the social and economic environment; and to protect the investment of both the city and the community within the development.
In designing a PUD development, special attention should be focused on the arrangement of buildings and other improvements for the orderly function and aesthetics, the preservation of open space for the use of residents and workers in the development, the variety of housing types and densities necessary to achieve a balanced neighborhood, and the provision of a pedestrian environment separate from the vehicular environment.

The process for determining the minimum parking requirements for a mixed-use development or for contiguous properties containing multiple uses is:
a.
Determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for each use category from Section 4.8.5, Parking and Loading Space Standards.
b.
Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods shown on the table below.
c.
Total the number of parking spaces for each of the time periods (add together the numbers in each column).
d.
The largest column total is the minimum shared parking requirement for the development or collectively for the contiguous properties.
e.
In no case shall parking spaces that are farther than one thousand (1,000) feet from a building entrance be allowed to satisfy off-street parking requirements for a use or be counted towards shared parking requirements.

Access.
a.
Adjoining properties shall be encouraged to share curb cuts to reduce interruptions to the sidewalks.
b.
Properties that are adjoining are required to have curb cuts to adjacent properties to create a connection between the two (2) properties. This keeps traffic off the main road and increases the likelihood that a customer will only have to look for a parking space once, if desired.
5.
Landscaping/Buffering.
a.
At least thirty percent (30%) of the paved surface area of each surface parking lot shall be shaded by mature landscaping within five (5) years of construction to provide a cool environment.
b.
The area between a parking lot and the public ROW shall have a boundary strip of at least five (5) feet. Trees within the boundary shall be planted a maximum of forty (40) feet on center, and no boundary shall have less than one (1) tree. A brick or stone wall thirty (30) inches tall, or shrubs maintained at a minimum mature height of twenty-four (24) inches and a maximum height of thirty (30) inches, shall be provided within the strip.
c.
All areas along the corridor which are not developed with buildings or prepared surfaces for parking, circulation, utilities or the like, shall be landscaped and maintained with ornamental plantings. These plantings should be native or drought-tolerant plants to minimize the need for irrigation. Green fields and wooded areas should be left as they are, until they are developed into another use. Paved areas of the site shall be limited in size to the area that is required to accommodate the intended use.
6.
Exterior Lighting.
a.
Decorative lighting must be provided at all entrances, pathways, parking areas, and recessed areas.
b.
All exterior lighting fixtures shall use full cutoff luminaires to reduce both energy usage and glare, as well as prevent light pollution.
c.
Lighting shall be pointed at the ground or the building directly to prevent glare onto neighboring areas.
d.
Light fixtures, light pole bases, and poles, shall be consistent with each other, with the architecture of buildings (if any), and/or with the nearby street lighting.
7.
Building Orientation.
a.
The required building setbacks of the underlying zoning district may be reduced in order to encourage new commercial buildings to develop closer to the street.
b.
Buildings may be set back further to allow for an appropriate building frontage zone which may include balconies or steps, public plazas, outdoor dining areas, or additional landscaping.
c.
Corner lots should be oriented to the corner and be used to create focal points at the four (4) corners of major street intersections.
d.
When buildings are located adjacent to existing commercial developments that are set further back, a step-back design may be utilized to transition to the desirable setback pattern, reducing excessive variation.
I.
Building Service Elements.
1.
Mechanical or utility equipment, including utility meters, shall be screened from public view.
a.
The method of screening may be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials, color, shape, and size in such a manner that the equipment is not visible from street level.

d.
The use of chain link fencing is not acceptable as concealment of mechanical units or waste/grease containers.
e.
New development shall bury utilities when possible to avoid a visually cluttered streetscape and to promote a more aesthetically pleasing environment.
f.
Rooftop mechanical units or other services and utilities that are located above grade shall be screened from public view. The method of screening can be met by implementing one (1) or more of the following strategies:
i.
Enclosing the utility within a roof that is integrated into the building form;
ii.
Locating the utility within an enclosed mechanical penthouse whose materials and detailing complement the building architecture;
iii.
Locating the utility far enough from the parapet so as to be effectively invisible from adjacent public rights-of-way.
J.
Entrances.
1.
All first story uses shall have a primary pedestrian entrance, which faces, is visible from, and is directly accessible from the sidewalk.
2.
All first-story businesses with more than sixty (60) feet of frontage along sidewalks shall provide one (1) pedestrian entrance for every sixty (60) linear feet of frontage or fraction thereof.
