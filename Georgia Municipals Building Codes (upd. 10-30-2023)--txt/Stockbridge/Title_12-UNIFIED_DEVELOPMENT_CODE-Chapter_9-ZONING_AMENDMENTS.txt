Chapter 9 - ZONING AMENDMENTS

9.1 - Application requirements.
9.1.1 - Pre-application conference.
A.
The purpose of the pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for the applicant to consult with city staff for advice and assistance prior to preparation of any zoning application. This will enable the applicant to become familiar with the approval process, required documents, the comprehensive plan, and public hearing standards that may affect the proposed development.
B.
The intent of this unified development code is that all procedural and development requirements be identified during the pre-application conference. However, no person may rely upon any comment concerning a proposed development, or any expression of any nature about the proposal, made by a participant at the pre-application conference, as a representation or implication that the proposal will be ultimately approved or rejected in any form. Additionally, failure of a participant to identify any applicable requirement or condition shall not preclude the city from requiring an applicant to comply with such requirement or condition.
9.1.2 - Amendment application.
After the pre-application conference, the applicant shall provide the following information for a map amendment (rezoning) or conditional use permit:
1.
The City of Stockbridge application for zoning.
2.
Proof of ownership.
3.
When the applicant is a representative of the property owner, a notarized statement authorizing the representative to act as an agent of the property owner with regard to the application and associated procedures.
4.

5.
A property survey conducted no more than five (5) years prior to the filing of the application, containing the legal description, boundaries, land area, notation whether any portion of the property is within a floodplain and existing improvements located on the site. Where two (2) or more parcels are included within a proposed development, the survey shall include all parcels that are part of the proposed development, including all phases. The survey shall be prepared and sealed by a surveyor registered in the State of Georgia. If the survey is older than five (5) years, the survey must be certified by a surveyor registered in the State of Georgia as to whether changes have or have not been made to the property.
6.

11.
Proof of payment of fees.
9.1.3 - Determination of completeness.
A.
All applications shall be complete before acceptance for review and decision-making. A determination of completeness is a determination that all required documents and plans have been submitted in sufficient number, and that all fees have been paid. A determination of completeness is not a determination of compliance with substantive standards and criteria.
B.
If the director determines that the application is not complete, the director shall send notice to the applicant identifying the deficiencies. The applicant shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notice to correct the deficiencies. Until the applicant corrects the deficiencies, no further action shall be taken for processing the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies within the thirty-day period, the application shall be deemed withdrawn, and fees shall be forfeited.

In deciding upon any application for an amendment to the official zoning map, the mayor and city council may, on their own motion or upon the suggestion of the applicant, or on consideration of the recommendations of the planning commission, grant the application subject to certain conditions necessary to promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare.
4.
The mayor and city council may include conditions of zoning which they deem necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the proposed uses of the district(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Such conditions:
a.
Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the amendment of adoption.

c.
Shall be required of the property owner and subsequent owners as a condition of their use of the property.

Shall be permitted and continuously enforced by the community development director in the same manner as any other provision of this unified development code.
5.
Prior to a final vote being taken upon any application for an amendment to the official zoning map for which such conditions shall be imposed, such conditions shall be announced at the public hearing and made a part of the motion to approve. If such conditions are found to be unacceptable, the applicant may withdraw or request a postponement. Upon such withdrawal, the applicant shall not be permitted to re-file the same zoning map amendment for the same property until twelve (12) months has elapsed from the date of withdrawal.

9.2.2 - Standards governing the exercise of zoning powers.
A.
In ruling upon any application for a zoning map amendment, or any other zoning decision, the mayor and council shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city. In doing so, they will consider one (1) or more of the following standards of review which are relevant to the application:
1.
Whether the proposal is consistent and/or compatible with the city's plans, goals and objectives reflected in the city's comprehensive plan.
2.
How the proposal impacts the purposes of the overall zoning scheme, and whether the proposed change furthers the purposes of these zoning regulations. Applications for zoning amendments that do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttable presumption that the proposed change shall adversely affect the zoning scheme.
3.
How the proposal impacts the character of the zoning district, the particular piece of property, neighborhoods, or the community.
4.
Whether the proposal creates an isolated district unrelated to adjacent properties and nearby districts.
5.
How the proposal impacts the aesthetic character of existing and future uses of the property and the surrounding area.
6.
Whether the proposal is consistent with adjacent development densities and the density patterns reflected in the comprehensive plan.
7.
How the proposal impacts the public health, safety, and general welfare.
8.
How the proposal impacts water, sewerage, other public facilities, or public services, and how the proposed amendment impacts expenditures of public funds.
9.
How the proposal impacts traffic safety and congestion.
10.
How the proposal impacts environmental conditions, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, water quality and quantity.
11.
How the proposal impacts the provision of adequate light and air.
12.
How the proposal impacts the value of adjacent property.
13.
Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations.
14.
Preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall carry greater weight than other factors. Where property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall carry greater weight.
B.
After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the mayor and council shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. The mayor and council are not required to consider every criterion in the standards of review. The applicant carries the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.
C.
If the mayor and council determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions that may be imposed by the mayor and council. Otherwise, such applications shall be denied.
D.
In ruling upon any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge to the existing zoning classification, the mayor and council shall follow these general lines of inquiry:
1.
The existing uses and zoning of the subject and surrounding property.
2.
The extent to which property values may be diminished by the particular zoning restrictions.
3.
The extent to which the reduction of property values, if any, promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.
4.
The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed upon the individual property owner.
5.
The suitability of subject property for development purposes as presently zoned.
6.
The length of time the property, if vacant, has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the vicinity of the property.
E.
The existing zoning classification shall be presumed to be valid; it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to present evidence to rebut this presumption.
F.
If the mayor and council determine, from the evidence presented, that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the applicant and is not offset by consideration of the public's health, safety, morals and general welfare, and consideration of the integrity of this chapter and of the official zoning map, the mayor and council may impose any appropriate zoning classification, including allowable conditions, which might be consistent with the considerations outlined in subsection (a) of this section.
