Chapter 8.12 - SIGN REGULATIONS

8.12.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is set forth as follows herein:
(a)
A comprehensive sign regulation is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth in Stockbridge and Henry County in general and because two (2) major interstate highways run through the city and attract signs that are unrelated to business uses inside the city, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values.
(b)
To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains its appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
(c)
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city.
(d)
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council hereby imposes the sign regulations contained in this article.
(e)
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intends by enacting this chapter to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the aesthetics of the city;
(3)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(4)
Maintain the historical image of the city;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Promote economic development; and
(7)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

(Ord. 03-78 ยง 1, 2003; Ord. 02-46 ยง 2 (part), 2002; Ord. No. 13-335, ยง 1, 11-11-2013)
8.12.045 - Sign measurement.
(a)
Area. The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight (8) straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign area from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within twenty-four (24) inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one (1) continuous polygon.
(b)
Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction; or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. Any portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign shall be included when computing sign height.
(c)
Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delineates the sign face.
(d)
Multi-faced signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle.
(e)
Sign area examples:
