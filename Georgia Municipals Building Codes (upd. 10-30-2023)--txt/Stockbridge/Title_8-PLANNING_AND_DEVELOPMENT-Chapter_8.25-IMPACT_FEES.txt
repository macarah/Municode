Any person who after the effective date of this chapter engages in development shall pay a development impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter.
A.
Construction Not Subject to Impact Fees.
1.
The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this chapter, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees:
a.
Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development (as defined in this chapter) that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property.
b.
Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development.
c.
Replacing a residential housing unit with another housing unit on the same lot or property.
d.
Placing or replacing a manufactured home in a manufactured home park on a prepared manufactured home pad in existence and operation prior to the effective date of this chapter.
e.
Placing a temporary construction or sales office on a lot during the period of construction or build-out of a development project.

Constructing an addition to or expansion of a residential dwelling unit that may increase the floor area or number of rooms but does not increase the number of housing units.
g.
Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, detached garage or utility shed, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool or tennis court.
2.
A person claiming to be not subject to impact fees under subsection A.1. of this section, above, shall submit to the administrator information and documentation sufficient to permit the administrator to determine whether such claim is correct.
B.
Grandfathered Projects.
1.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit.
2.
Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this chapter may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this chapter, provided that:
a.
All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be or have been paid in full; and
b.
Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within one hundred eighty (180) days, whichever is later.
C.
Method of Calculation.
1.
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development.
2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element, and which:
a.
Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and
b.
Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category for which an impact fee is imposed.
3.
The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this chapter shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the city, and may be amended from time to time by official act.
4.
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element.
5.
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element.
D.
Service Areas. The city limits of the City of Stockbridge, Georgia, constitute a single service area for all public facilities subject to impact fees under this chapter.
(Ord. No. 19-480, 1(Exh. A), 3-11-2019)
8.25.050 - Fee assessment and payment.
A.
Fee Schedule.
1.
Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the city council, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
2.
When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure other than a shopping center, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. Shopping centers shall be assessed a single impact fee, in accordance with the fee schedule on file with the office of the city clerk, as a single use without regard to its individual tenants.
3.
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use category and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the land use categories shown on the adopted fee schedule.
c.
If the land use of the proposed development is not similar to a land use category shown on the adopted fee schedule, then an appropriate fee may be determined by the administrator as an individual assessment in accordance with the individual assessment determinations section of this chapter.
d.
Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.
B.
Timing of Assessment and Payment.
1.
Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit.
2.
All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than at the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy for the building or building shell.
3.
For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property, whichever is earliest.
4.
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the following:
a.
Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy, as applicable, the developer shall recertify in writing to the administrator the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage of floor area attributable to each use.
b.
In the event that the actual land use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual land use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the impact fee applicable to the actual land use or uses and/or gross square footage exceeds the impact fee previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy.
c.
The amount of the excess shall be based upon the impact fee schedule in effect on the date the interior finishes permit or the certificate of occupancy is issued.
d.
If the actual gross square footage constructed after the issuance of the building permit is less than the amount originally certified, the developer shall be entitled to a refund of the excess portion of the fee in accordance with this chapter.
5.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the original building permit shall result in the assessment of such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the original building permit.
C.
Individual Assessment Determinations. An individual assessment of development impact fees for a particular property or proposed use may be established as follows:
1.
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office.
2.
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. The individual assessment study shall:
a.
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or
b.
Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the city or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology.
3.
The applicant shall provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination.
4.
The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this chapter. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.
5.
Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

1.
The administrator shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the impact fee schedule within five (5) working days after the administrator's receipt of a completed application. The fee schedule certified by the administrator shall establish the impact fee schedule for the proposed development activity for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of certification.
2.
The administrator shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the administrator shall establish the total impact fee for the proposed development activity for the 180-day period immediately following the date of such certification.
3.
Notwithstanding the issuance of any certification of an individual fee determination, any additions to the proposed development activity different from the development activity identified in the original application shall negate any such certification.
(Ord. No. 19-480, 1(Exh. A), 3-11-2019)
8.25.060 - Exemptions.
A.
Exemption Policy. The city council recognizes that some development projects may provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic and employment advancement of the city and the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general.

1.
An application for exemption approval must be made to the administrator prior to or along with an application for the first building permit or other qualifying permit. Any exemptions not so applied for shall be deemed waived.
2.
A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and payment of impact fees has been made.

Continuation of Validity. Failure of the city council to undertake a periodic review of the capital improvements element shall result in the continued use and application of the latest adopted development impact fee schedule; project listings, including estimated costs and impact eligibility percentages; and data upon which the level of service standards and impact fee calculations are based. The failure to periodically review such data shall not invalidate this chapter.
