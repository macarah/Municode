ARTICLE VIII. - RS—RESIDENTIAL SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT

Sec. 59-800. - Purpose and intent.
It is the intent of the residential single-family district to provide suitable areas where the development of residential subdivisions has occurred or is occurring. These areas are intended to establish and preserve quiet, stable and affordable single-family neighborhoods at medium-densities, free from other land uses, except those which are compatible with and convenient to the residents of such district.
It is also the intent of this district to recognize the need for conservation and open space as densities increase and to require that open spaces be set aside for the benefit of the community, the developer and all future generations who live in this district.
To support conservation designs and encourage open spaces, this district is designed to:
(1)
Retain and protect open space areas within residential developments;
(2)
Promote new development, which is compatible with existing uses, architecture, landscapes and community character;
(3)
Provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and interest of land owners and the individual characteristics of their properties;
(4)
Preserve unique and sensitive landscapes and site features by locating new dwelling sites in areas removed from such features;
(5)
Protect scenic vistas from encroachment by development;
(6)
Provide an opportunity for flexible lot designs and building arrangements not afforded to with lot-by-lot development, allowing for buildings and improvements to be sited as a response to site conditions, with the locations of lot lines reflecting land management decisions;
(7)
Provide for a more varied, innovative and efficient development pattern;
(8)
Provide a means to attain the objectives of the Stephens County Comprehensive Plan providing for orderly growth, enhancement of natural resources and preservation of rural characteristics.
Sec. 59-801. - Permitted uses.

(a)
Residences, single-family detached, including manufactured homes and modular homes, provided that only one such residence is permitted per lot for any properties under two acres.

(b)
Accessory uses and structures normally incidental and subordinate to one or more permitted principal uses.
(c)
Farm animals may be raised on property in a residential single-family district (RS) as long as the parcel has a minimum of three acres and is not within a subdivision as defined by the Stephens County Subdivision Ordinance; with three or more acres, for every whole acre, a limit of one farm animal shall be permitted. An exception shall be backyard chickens, as referenced below. Any and all livestock shall be confined to a fenced enclosure. The enclosure shall be at least 20 feet from any established or existing setback. No farm animals shall be allowed in the front-yard setback.
(d)
Backyard chickens. The keeping of chickens supports a local, sustainable food system by providing an affordable, nutritious food source of fresh eggs. The keeping of chickens also provides free nitrogen-rich fertilizer, chemical-free pest control, animal companionship and pleasure, and weed control. This regulation is intended to make a provision for the limited keeping of chickens, for the health, convenience, and personal enjoyment benefits afforded by such use within single-family residential districts (RS) provided that:
(1)
No roosters shall be permitted in RS-zoned parcels without conditional approval.

Within the fenced enclosure, a well-maintained structure (henceforth referred to as a coop) shall be required for all chickens.
(5)
The coop and area within the fenced enclosure must be clean and odor free, kept in a neat and sanitary condition at all times, in a manner that will not disturb the use or enjoyment of neighboring lots due to noise, objectionable odor, or other adverse impact.
(6)
Objectionable odors from chickens, their waste, or other chicken-related substances shall not be perceptible at the property boundary line to the general public, county marshals, county sheriff, or the lawful designee of Stephens County.

Provision must be made for the storage and removal of chicken droppings and any dead chickens. All stored droppings shall be covered by a fully enclosed structure with a roof or lid over the entire structure. All other droppings not used for composting or fertilizing shall be removed. In addition, the coop, enclosure, and surrounding area must be kept free from trash and accumulated droppings. Dead chickens must be disposed of in a sanitary manner.
