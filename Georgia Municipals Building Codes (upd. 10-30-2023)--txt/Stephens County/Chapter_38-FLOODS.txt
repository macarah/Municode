ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 38-31. - Statutory authorization of article.
The legislature of the state delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. No. 87-2, art. 1, § A, 8-4-1987)
Sec. 38-32. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. No. 87-2, art. 1, § B, 8-4-1987)
Sec. 38-33. - Statement of purpose of article.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. No. 87-2, art. 1, § C, 8-4-1987)
Sec. 38-34. - Objectives of article.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations.
Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls.
Field representative means the county conservation district office field representative.
Flood and flooding mean a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1)
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
(2)
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as zone A.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building, including the basement, such as the top of slab in concrete slab construction or the top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking cars.
Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include longterm storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article.
Mangrove stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which is mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above the ground and which contain one or more of the following species: black mangrove (Avicennia nitida); red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle); white mangrove (Lanauncularia racemosa); and buttonwood (Conocarpus erecta).
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes the terms "park trailers," "travel trailers" and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days.

Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (PL 97-348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, including a manufactured home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.
Substantial improvement means, for a structure built prior to the enactment of this article, any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the closest of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state inventory of historic places.
Variance means a grant or relief to a person from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

Sec. 38-93. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-38 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(Ord. No. 87-2, art. 5, § C, 8-4-1987)
Sec. 38-94. - Standards for small streams.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-38, where small streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet on each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 38-65.
(Ord. No. 87-2, art. 5, § D, 8-4-1987)
