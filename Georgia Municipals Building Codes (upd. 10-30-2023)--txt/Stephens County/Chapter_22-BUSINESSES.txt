ARTICLE III. - DOOR TO DOOR PEDDLERS AND SOLICITORS

Sec. 22-71. - Intent and purpose.
The intent of the board of commissioners in enacting this article is to regulate the sale of goods and services by solicitors or canvassers at residences in the county in order to diminish criminal activity in the county and abusive techniques utilized by any such solicitor or canvasser which adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare in the county. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of door-to-door solicitation, nor is it an attempt to adversely affect interstate commerce. Instead, this article is intended to balance competing interests, reduce criminal activity and protect county citizens from abusive sales techniques versus the conduct of proper commercial sales activity. This article is not intended to allow any business activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
