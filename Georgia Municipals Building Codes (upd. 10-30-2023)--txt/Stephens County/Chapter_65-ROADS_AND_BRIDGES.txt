Chapter 65 - ROADS AND BRIDGES
ARTICLE I. - ROADS RIGHT-OF-WAY AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM

Sec. 65-1. - Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this article is to regulate activities affecting the rights-of-way and drainage system of public ways within the unincorporated area of the county in order to maintain the integrity of the public ways, protect safety of the public by having unobstructed rights-of-way and protect property owners abutting such. Those portions of this article requiring a permit shall not apply to roadways under the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation where permits are issued by that agency. Those portions of this article prohibiting activities which compromise the integrity of the public road system and its drainage structures shall apply to all public ways within the unincorporated area of the county irrespective of the government agency exercising jurisdiction over such roads.

Sec. 65-2. - Residential and commercial driveway and drainage structure permit.
No person shall install a culvert or other drainage structure on any public way for the purpose of allowing vehicular ingress and egress to a dwelling unit, a business or commercial enterprise unless and until a permit has been obtained from the employees of the public works department, the planning department, the building official, the administrator, or such other person or persons as the board may from time to time designate for that purpose. A permit shall not be required for structures installed by county forces. The permit shall set forth the size and type of the culvert or other drainage structure and approve the installation thereof. No fee for the permit shall be charged.

(b)
No person shall cause water to be discharged onto any public way from the premises of a commercial or business enterprise, or from the premises of a dwelling unit, or from a vacant lot, which water discharge contains sediment, trash, or other debris in an amount sufficient to cause deposit of such material within the public way.
(c)
No owner of any interest in real property, possessory or otherwise, shall allow to be discharged from such premises onto any public way water containing sediment, trash, or other debris in an amount sufficient to cause deposit of such material within the public way.
(d)
No person shall alter any public way drainage system in any manner causing water to be discharged across the travelled surface of the public way and all driveway installations, residential, commercial or otherwise, shall ensure that runoff enters the roadway drainage system on the side of the public way abutting the installation.
(Ord. of 11-10-2020)
Sec. 65-4. - Road maintenance and improvement policy.
(a)
New roads and streets will be accepted at the discretion of the Stephens County Board of Commissioners through a motion in an opening meeting and a formal acceptance and recording of right-of-way deeds with a minimum of 60 feet right-of-way where applicable allowing adequate space to turn around the equipment utilized by public works. The county assumes no obligation to improve the quality or character of the roadway or street above that which was accepted for maintenance. Nothing in the section shall imply that any private road or street in the unincorporated area of the county will be accepted into the County Road System by the Stephens County Board of Commissioners. Decisions with regard to the acceptance of a roadway or street into the Stephens County Road System shall be determined on a case by case basis and must be approved and accepted by formal vote by the Stephens County Board of Commissioners.
(b)
Existing county roads and streets located within dedicated rights-of-way accepted by the county shall be maintained at a reasonable level of service so as to provide egress and ingress to abutting property owners; however, the county shall not be obligated to widen, pave or make other improvements to such roads and streets which increase the value of the abutting property.
(c)
Existing roads and streets which have become public through the operation of prescriptive rights of the public users, and on which maintenance work has been historically performed by the county, shall continue to be maintained by the county to a level of service that will provide reasonable egress and ingress to abutting properties; however, the county shall not make substantial improvements on such roads and streets until appropriate rights-of-way have been granted, accepted and properly filed for record.
(d)
Existing private roads, streets and driveways shall not be maintained by the county, nor shall new private roads and streets be constructed by the county. However, safety of the traveling public is a high priority, therefore, from time to time it may be desirable in the interest of safety to perform a limited amount of maintenance to provide positive drainage and sight distance at private road, street, and driveway approaches. This act shall not obligate the county to perform future maintenance at these locations.
(e)
With respect to road and street improvements, the county recognizes its responsibility to expend public funds for road and street improvements on roads which are primarily intracounty traffic conductors. With respect to the improvement of residential streets and other roads primarily residential in nature, it shall be the policy of the county to assign priority to those roads and streets where the benefiting property owners substantially contribute to the payment of the cost of improvements.
