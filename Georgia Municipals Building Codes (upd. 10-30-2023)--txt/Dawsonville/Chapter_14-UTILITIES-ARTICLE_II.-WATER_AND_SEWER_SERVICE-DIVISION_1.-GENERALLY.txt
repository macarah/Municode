(b)
No statement in this section is intended or may be construed to prohibit the appropriate agency from adding, deleting, or changing specific requirements or from making specific requirements more restrictive where wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the sewage system, or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge from any treatment facility operated by the city to violate effluent or stream quality standards imposed or as may be imposed by the state environmental protection division and/or the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Sec. 14-82. - Action required by city, the mayor, or any duly authorized representative.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in sections 14-78 through 14-81 and which, in the judgment of the city, the city manager, or any duly authorized representative, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, sludge quality, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city, the city manager, or any duly authorized representative may:
(1)
Reject the wastes;
(2)
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
(3)
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
(4)
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating wastes not covered by existing fees or sewer charges or such charges as may be set from time to time by the city council; and/or
(5)
Take such other appropriate action as may be found necessary to meet POTW pretreatment program requirements established in or pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f).

Sec. 14-83. - Contracts to provide wastewater treatment services.
In order to comply with applicable state and federal water pollution control standards and to be eligible for grant-in-aid or other allotments, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the city is authorized, in the discretion of the city council, to enter into valid and binding contracts with private persons, firms, associations, or corporations for any period of time not to exceed 50 years, to obtain and provide wastewater treatment services to such private persons, firms, associations, or corporations, provided that such contracts shall provide that the charge for the services shall never be less than the actual cost to the city for providing the services.
(Ord. of 2-23-2004, § 2)
Sec. 14-84. - High strength wastewater surcharge.
(a)
Establishment of surcharge. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the city sewerage system may be assessed a monetary surcharge in addition to the normally required sewer use charges in an amount to be calculated below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains any of the following six primary pollutants above the lower levels set forth on a monthly average concentration basis and shall not exceed the maximum level on a daily average concentration basis:
(1)
Five-day 20°C (20 degrees Centigrade) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) above 350 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 600 mg/l.
(2)
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) above 700 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 1,200 mg/l.
(3)
Total ammonium nitrogen NH 3 -N above 30 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 60 mg/l.
(4)
Total TKN above 40 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 80 mg/l.
(5)
Total phosphorus above 20 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 30 mg/l.
(6)
Floatable oil and grease above 100 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 150 mg/l.
(7)
Total suspended solids above 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 600 mg/l.
The above parameters shall be determined by the utilization of sampling and testing procedures as provided in (d) below.
(b)
Formula. When the concentration of the surcharge parameters exceeds the lower level values shown above, the excess concentration shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount obtained using the following formula:
Surcharge $/month = P × Q × 8.34 × C
Where:
"P" is the excess monthly average concentration in mg/l of the parameter (BOD 5 , etc.) being evaluated i.e. the actual concentration less the allowable lower level concentration listed in paragraph (A). The maximum level concentration shall not be exceeded.
"Q" is equal to the user's monthly flow in millions of gallons.
"C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameter. This value shall be established by the city based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary.
Since high strength wastewater can inhibit the treatment process, as a penalty the costs per pound shall increase if the pollutant concentration increases above the lower level limit as follows:
EXPAND
Pollutant Increase Costs per Pound Net Result
0—25% increase 0% increase Surcharge + no penalty
26—50% increase 100% increase Surcharge + 100% penalty
51—75% increase 150% increase Surcharge + 150% penalty
Over 75% increase 300% increase Surcharge + 300% penalty
  (c)
Quantitative measurements of surchargeable parameters. The measurements of the surchargeable parameters shall be conducted as follows:
(1)
Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the user as required in either the pretreatment permit or a minimum of two tests per month. The average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If multiple tests are taken and at least two tests exceed the allowable limit, then the surcharge and penalty will be prorated.
(2)
Above the required two tests per month, the city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense. The city will split the sample with the user at the user's request.
(d)
Sampling and testing procedures.
(1)
The user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportioned sampling is not feasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
All wastewater monitoring samples required should be tested by an independent laboratory, with the results submitted to the city on laboratory report sheets. The requirement for utilization of an independent laboratory may be waived by the city when the required tests are performed by the city or other approved agency or when "split" samples are provided to the city and the city's testing results show a reasonably good correlation with the user's in-house testing results.
All measurements, tests and analyses shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater."
(3)
The costs incurred for sampling and testing shall be the responsibility of the customer.
(e)
Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section will be included either on the user's regular water and sewer bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill.
