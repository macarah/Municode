(b)
Upon receipt of the written notice of violation, the owner and any party of interest of the structure or premises shall have five days from the date of the written notice to object in writing to the alleged violation. If no objection is received by the city within five days, the violation shall be deemed proven, the structure or premises declared in violation, and action taken as set forth herein below. If an objection is received by the city within five days, the objection shall be reviewed by the director and if upon review the director determines no violation has been proven, the notice of violation shall be dismissed.

If the violation is deemed proven, the director shall issue and serve by hand delivery or via U.S. Mail the owner and any party of interest an administrative order. Except in the case of a violation of sections 102-57 or 102-58, the administrative order shall allow the owner of the premises or structure up to 90 days to cure the violation before any fine is assessed pursuant to subsection (d) below. The administrative order shall be issued according to the following criteria:
(1)
Violations concerning structures:
a.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of a structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to repair, alter, or improve the structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial, or business use within a specified time as is reasonable to accomplish the repair, alteration or improvement. Or, in the alternative, the administrative order may allow the owner or parties in interest to vacate and close the structure to all human habitation, commercial, industrial or business use; or
b.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to remove or demolish such structure within a reasonable specified time. In no event shall the administrative order require removal or demolition of any structure except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value the structure will have when repaired.

Violations concerning premises: When the violation concerns the repair, alteration, or improvement of premises, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to repair, alter, or improve the premises so as to render it fit for its current residential, commercial, industrial or business use. Or, in the alternative, the administrative order may allow the owner or parties in interest to vacate and close the premises to all human habitation, commercial, industrial or business use.

If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an administrative order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close or demolish such structure or premises in accordance with the administrative order:
(1)
The director may assess a fine not to exceed $250.00 per day and serve notice of the fine upon the owner and parties in interest of such premises or structure. Each day that a violation continues after due notice has been served shall be deemed a separate offense, provided that the director shall have the discretion to provide an extension of time to cure any violations in the event that the director determines such an extension is necessary and appropriate in light of the specific circumstances of such violation. Any fines associated with a violation of this article remaining unpaid shall constitute a lien on the real property of the subject premises or structure, and shall be collected pursuant to the process and procedures set forth in subsection (3), below.
(2)
In addition to the fine set forth in subsection (d)(1), the mayor and council may cause such structure or premises to be repaired, altered, or improved or be vacated and closed or demolished in accordance with the administrative order. The director shall post on the main entrance of any structure so closed a placard with the following words:
"This structure/premises is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use; the use or occupation of this structure/premises for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use is prohibited and unlawful."
(3)
In the event the mayor and council cause a structure or premises to be repaired, altered, improved, or to be vacated and closed or demolished, the cost of such action along with any assessed fines shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the payment of the aforementioned costs by the city. The city shall file a statement of lien on the real estate records of Dawson County and cross-reference the same against the owner's deed. The city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for fines, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of structures or premises in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 48-5-358 and 48-5-359 and other applicable state statutes along with section 11-1 of the city code.
