Sec. 8-706. - Annual license fee.
The annual license fee, as described in this article and as set forth in section 2-110, is established pursuant to the following consideration:
(1)
For owner-occupied property used for short-term rentals, only square footage of the dwelling unit actually rented is used to calculate the annual license fee. For example, if there is a secondary dwelling unit or structure that is rented out as a complete unit, the entire square footage of said unit or structure is considered.
(2)
For bed and breakfast establishments, the square footage of any lodging rooms, as well as any common area between guests that is separate and apart from areas used as the primary residence of the operator is used to calculate the annual license fee. For example, if the operator of a bed and breakfast establishment resides in a separate structure on the premise from the main dwelling, the entire square footage of the main dwelling is used to calculate the annual license fee. Alternatively, if the operator resides in the main dwelling and only rents out private lodging rooms, only the square footage of any lodging room, closet, and private bathroom, or common bathroom exclusively used for guests is used to calculate the annual license fee.
(3)
For short-term home rentals, where an entire dwelling unit is rented out, the square footage of the entire dwelling unit is used to calculate the annual license fee. For example, if a property-owner markets and rents an entire home or dwelling unit, the square footage of the entire home or dwelling unit would be considered in calculating the annual license fee.
(4)
For hotels, the square footage of all lodging rooms and guest common areas, including, but in no way limited to, lobbies, dining rooms, hallways, pool areas, gyms, and other recreational facilities are included in the calculation of the annual license fee.
(5)
For buildings or structures used for commercial or business purposes, the square footage of the building, structure or portion thereof that is rented out is used to calculate the annual license fee.

Any licensee who has not submitted the renewal application and required fee by 4:00 p.m. on November 20, shall pay a late charge as determined by the mayor and city council and set forth in section 2-110.
