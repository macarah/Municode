Sec. 98-41. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish a reliable and consistent system of assigning unique addresses to structures and properties within the city. Such system is necessary to ensure the continued public health, safety, and welfare in the following respects:
(a)
It will improve response time by law enforcement, fire, ambulance, and other emergency services;
(b)
It will provide a basis for the development of sub-systems that can automatically and quickly generate specific, reliable directions for drivers from any starting location to any destination within the city;
(c)
It will prevent and resolve duplication of addresses and route names, confusing or misleading addresses, and multiple addresses for a single location.
(d)
It will improve the delivery of public services, such as building inspections, road and infrastructure repair and maintenance, soil evaluations, utility installation and service, health inspections, property tax administration, property mapping, school busing, and other public services;
(e)
It will provide for coordination among the mapping and geographic information systems (GIS) in use by various public utilities, parcel delivery, and governmental and quasi-governmental entities operating in the county;
(f)
It will provide a clear and rational procedure for assigning new addresses and road names within the city as the need shall arise.
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009)
Sec. 98-42. - Enforcement authority.
All addressing functions in the city shall be the responsibility of the chief of the fire department. The fire chief may designate one or more persons to carry out the responsibilities set forth in this article. The fire chief's duties shall include, but shall not be limited to, assigning addresses to new plats, assigning addresses for new residential and commercial construction, identifying and correcting addressing anomalies, giving initial approval or disapproval to new or proposed street names, and making recommendation to the mayor and council for naming new streets or renaming existing streets. All applicants applying to name a new street, to rename an existing street, or to receive a residential or commercial address shall comply with this article.
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009)
Sec. 98-43. - Intergovernmental cooperation.
The chief of the fire department or his designee shall coordinate with the county addressing administrator in carrying out the responsibilities set forth in this article to ensure that the purposes of this article are carried to the fullest extent practicable given the particular interests of the city. Among other things, the city shall use the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of a location identified by the county in determining all addresses.
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009)
Sec. 98-44. - Address number assignment.
Address assignment shall be based upon the type descriptions listed below. Addresses shall be supplied only for habitable structures and devices with existing telephone service. Addresses for proposed habitable structures will be provided only after the final location of ingress and egress to the structure and the final location of the structure are evident on the ground so that the correct and final GPS location of the structure, as an access point can be located. An address will be provided for all final building permit applications.
(a)
Frontage interval address style. Address numbers shall be assigned to each structure, as defined herein, a "location number" based upon its distance (i.e., the number of 10.56-foot segments) from the origin point of the road to the center point of the access drive.
(b)
Odd/even number location. Numbers are odd on the left hand side of the road and even on the right side of the road as the numbers increase.
(c)
Fractional, alphanumeric, hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This also applies to apartment numbers and suite numbers. This also applies to secondary location indicators such as apartment numbers and suite numbers.
(d)
Component order. Components of a road address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), road name and road type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number.
(e)
Diagonal roads. Diagonal roads shall be treated as either north-south or east-west roads. Once orientation is established it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road.
(f)
Circular roads. A circular road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular roads shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered to match and mix with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between the inside numbers. Numbering sequence of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road retaining odd/even designations on the appropriate side of the circular road.
(g)
Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure; odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the road and meeting at the mid-point, or the back of the cul-de-sac.
(h)
Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road off which the driveway is accessed. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested.
(i)
Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. Private drives and easements serving more than two lots or structures shall be addressed to the private drive/easement.
(j)
Single-family dwellings. A single-family dwelling shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction.
(k)
Duplexes/apartment residences/office buildings/strip commercial buildings. Structures of this type shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual unit being assigned unit/suite numbers as secondary location indicators. The unit number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., "Unit 204" is the fourth unit on the second floor). Alphanumeric numbers are not permitted. Buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of units, shall require an address for each individual entrance. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of units/suites.
(l)
Townhouses. Townhouses individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. Townhouses under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators.
(m)
Condominiums. Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit.
(n)
Miscellaneous/secondary structures. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering or possessing landline telephone service are required to have their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drive shall be assigned an address following the basic rules for distance and direction.
(o)
Wireless towers. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When additional carriers are collocated thereon, all carriers, including the first carrier, will be assigned a suite number with the address.
(p)
Flag lots. Buildings obtaining access through a panhandle to a public road will be addressed to the public road to which they obtain access. If the lot contains two or more principal structures and share a common access, the access itself shall be named as a road for addressing purposes.
(q)
Special case lots/parcels. Special case lots developed facing a named road with access provided by a private alley, from a side road, shall be numbered to the facing road. Individual buildings on lots created facing an unnamed driveway shall be addressed off the public street from which it gains access. If the structure is more than 150 feet from the named road or is not visible from the named road, the address number shall be displayed on the structure and at the end of the driveway or easement that provides access to the structures, and be visible and legible from all directions of travel.
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009)
Sec. 98-45. - Street naming.
(a)
Names should be appropriate for the individual street and the area's nature and character, enhance community image, have historical, physical, aesthetic or local color perspective and shall not be vulgar, offensive, or reasonably subject to double meaning.
(b)

(h)
Street names may not be duplicated by combining two words into one word or separating one word to make two words; for example, Maple Crest Drive, Maplecrest Drive.
(i)
Street names may not be duplicated by spelling out a number; for example, 6th Street, Sixth Street.
(j)
Street names that are spelled differently yet sound the same shall not be allowed; for example, Gayle Way is considered a duplication of Gail Lane, and Amy Drive is considered a duplication of Aimee Lane.

Sec. 98-50. - Street and/or city facilities name changes.
(a)
Recognition of public interest. The city recognizes that, from time to time a certain individual or organization may make historical, cultural or other important contributions to the city, the state or the United States that merit recognition by renaming a city street and/or other city facilities, in their honor, the city also recognizes that certain streets and/or city facilities have already been named in honor of other important contributions to the city, the state or the United States. This section prescribes the procedure by which existing city streets and/or city facilities may be named in honor of individuals and organizations, while preserving the integrity of those streets and city facilities that have already been historically connected or dedicated with the name of an individual or organization.
(b)
Purpose. To establish a systemic and consistent approach for the official renaming of city streets and/or city facilities.
(c)
Definition.
City facilities means all property assets under municipal ownership and/or control or to be deeded to the municipality, including but not limited to streets, bridges, buildings, structures, open spaces, public parks, trails, natural areas, wetlands, environmental habitat, and land.
(d)
Criteria. The city will rename streets and/or city facilities through an adopted process utilizing criteria emphasizing community value and character, local history, geography, environmental, as well as civics and service to the community. Names proposed should fall within one of the following categories: local history/ context name, historic/natural resource, or commemorative name. The following criteria shall be used in determining the appropriateness of the naming designation:
(1)
Local history/context name. Use historic references, with submittal of a one-page documentation of local history or contextual references taken from print and/or other factual documentation.
(2)
Natural/historic resource:
a.
Use geographic location of the facility;
b.
Use outstanding natural features in immediate proximity of the facility (i.e. hill, stream, lake, notable tree, street, community or neighborhood);
c.
Use site, structure, and/or place of historic or cultural significance on or in immediate proximity of the facility; and
d.
Avoid use of names having intended spelling errors, creating a false sense of history (e.g. Towne, Olde), or reflecting natural features not extant (e.g. Mountain Peak Road).
(3)
Commemorative name:
a.
An individual*, family, and/or group of historical or cultural significance, with submittal of a one-page biographical sketch providing documentation of direct civic contributions to the facility, or the city overall.
*Individual of historic or cultural significance—minimum qualifications:
1.
Native to or clearly identified with the city,
2.
Made exceptional service contribution to the community in his/her field of endeavor, and
3.
An inspiration to others to make use of their talents,
4.
Must be deceased.
b.
An individual, family, and/or group (or designated honoree) having made a substantial financial contribution of land and/or donation to the city facility or city, itself, with submittal of a one-page biographical sketch providing documentation of the direct contribution toward the acquisition or development of the specific facility or street (does not have to be deceased).
(e)
Application procedure:
(1)
A request for renaming of a city street and/or city facility shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk.
(2)
Those submitting a naming request should show how the proposed name is consistent with the criteria stated in this section.
(3)
The application must contain a detailed cost estimate for the implantation of any street renaming, including all costs associated with producing and installing appropriate signage to effectuate city street and/or city facility renaming. A $300.00 nonrefundable administrative fee to cover other associated costs concerning the city's consideration of the application for the street and/or city facility renaming, including advertising the proposed street and/or city facility renaming, must also accompany the application.
(4)
Because street renaming often imposes a significant hardship on residences and businesses located on the street due to the fact that maps, banking information, driver's license information, billing information, websites, advertising information, letterheads and other stationary or residential/business materials, and other information relative to the affected residences or businesses will need to be changed as a result of a street renaming, the application must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses and signatures of 100 percent of the residents residing or businesses located on the street to which the street renaming applies in favor of the street renaming and whose address will change as a result of the street renaming.
(f)
Consideration of application; effectuating the street and/or city facility renaming:
(1)
The city staff will review the proposal for adherence to the stated criteria and authentication of the statements relative to contributions in the case of an individual before forwarding to the mayor and council. If the request is incomplete, staff will contact the applicant, in writing, and provide them with the opportunity to resubmit a revised request.
(2)
The mayor and council will offer the opportunity for public input on the proposed renaming.
(3)
Each application must meet the criteria in this section but meeting all criteria does not ensure renaming.
(4)
The mayor and council shall make the final decision by enactment of a resolution.
(5)
If the street and/or city facility renaming is accepted by the city and adopted by the mayor and council of the city, in accordance with the City's Code, then the applicant will be further required to submit payment to the city in the amount of the cost of installation of signage and/or other amenities associated with the street and/or city facility renaming. Funds received will be deposited into the general fund of the city.
(6)
Costs to implement a street and/or city facility renaming must be paid to the city within 30 days of the applicant's receipt of notice from the city that the application has been accepted by the city and further setting forth the cost of the street renaming or dedication to be remitted to the city.
(7)
Upon the adoption of the renaming and the payments of said costs, renaming of the street and/or city facility is to be completed within a six month time period.
(8)
Notice of the renaming must be provided to all property owners located on the street, U.S. Postal Service, and other entities as appropriate.

ARTICLE VII. - INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE

Sec. 98-170. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is intended to insure that all intersections shall have an unobstructed sight distance along all approaches, creating a vision clearance triangle sufficient to avoid vehicle conflicts for all approaching and departing vehicles, traveling at or less than the maximum speed limit. This is intended to apply to all intersections which would include public and private streets and driveways.
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016)
Sec. 98-171. - Street intersection—Sight obstruction.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, no person may park vehicles or install, set out, or maintain any sign, structure, fence, wall, hedge, shrubbery, natural growth/terrain, or other obstruction which either individually or collectively obscures an area in excess of 12 inches in width except utility poles or traffic lights or sign posts which impedes the view of motor vehicle operators at a street intersection within the clear sight triangles and between the height limits defined further in this section. The public works director may determine that certain intersections do not require the sight distance mandates of this ordinance. In such instances, parked vehicles shall be permitted only where clearly marked or signed by city government.
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016)
Sec. 98-172. - Sight distance required.
(a)
No sight obstruction, as previously defined, shall be placed or maintained between a height of 2½ feet and a height of ten feet above the upper face of the nearest curb (or grade level at the intersecting street centerline if no curb exists) and within the sight triangle as shown in Figure 1 meeting the required intersection sight distance as designated in Table 1.
(b)
The vertex (decision point) of the sight triangle on the minor road should be 15 feet from the edge of the major-road traveled way. This represents the typical position of the minor-road driver's eye when a vehicle is stopped relatively close to the major road.

    1.
The provided intersection sight distance values are required for stopped vehicles to safely cross or turn left onto an intersecting street with traffic moving at the corresponding design speed. Distances are intended as a minimum guideline. Site conditions such as grades, traffic volumes, signalization types, etc. may warrant increases in desired sight distances as directed by the public works director or his or her designee.
_____
(c)
The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a passenger vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the City roadway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the major road speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed.
(d)
The sight distances given in Table 1 are for undivided highways and streets. If the highway or street is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars.
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016)
Sec. 98-173. - Special sight obstruction cases.
When obstructions exist which do not comply with this article, but may not be removed without severe hardship to the property owner, the public works director or his or her designee may allow the obstruction to remain so long as the intersection is otherwise reasonably safe and other safety measures are available such as stopping sight distance is obtainable.
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016)
Sec. 98-174. - Obstruction declared a nuisance.
Every obstruction prohibited by this article is deemed a nuisance and may be abated as follows. The city may require an owner of property to remove any and all sight obstructions necessary to meet the required unobstructed sight distance/clear sight triangles as specified herein. In the event an owner of property refuses to remove the sight obstruction upon request, the city may remove the sight obstruction with city forces or in the alternative, may retain the services of a person or persons qualified to so remove the sight obstruction, and bill the owner of the property for any and all expenses incurred. The city shall be under no obligation to reimburse the owners of said property for any loss or damage resulting from said removal.
