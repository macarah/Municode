ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 102-1. - Purpose.
The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of land within the city and county. In furtherance of this purpose these regulations are adopted to:
(1)
Encourage the development of economically sound and stable communities;
(2)
Ensure the provision of required streets, and where practical, utilities and other facilities and services to new land developments;
(3)
Ensure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land developments;
(4)
Ensure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and
(5)
Ensure, in general, the wise development of new areas, in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the community as it now exists or may be established.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-2. - Authority.
These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority conferred by the Georgia General Planning Enabling Act of 1957 as amended. (House Bill No. 400)
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-3. - Jurisdiction.
These regulations will govern all subdivision of land within the limits of the city as now or hereafter established, and the unincorporated area of the county.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-4. - Use of plat.
The transfer of, sale of, agreement to sell, or negotiation to sell land by reference to or exhibition of, or other use of a plat of a subdivision that has not been given final approval by the planning commission and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county is prohibited; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-5. - Erection of buildings.
No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be erected on any lot in the county unless the street giving access thereto has been accepted as a public street in accordance with this resolution, or unless such street had attained the status of a public street prior to the effective date of this ordinance or on a street accepted by the governing body.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-6. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Building line means a line beyond which no foundation wall or part of the structure of any building shall project, with the exception of roof overhang and the subsurface projection of footings.
Crosswalk means a right-of-way within a block dedicated to public use, intended primarily for pedestrian use designed to provide access to adjacent roads and lots.
Health department means the Georgia Department of Public Health and/or the Whitfield County Health Department.
Lot means a portion of a subdivision intended as a unit for transfer of ownership or for development or both. The word "lot" includes the words "plot" or "parcel."
Lot width means the width of the lot at the building line measured parallel to the street right-of-way line or in the case of a curvilinear street parallel to the chord of the arc between the intersection of the side lot lines and the street right-of-way line.
Planning commission means the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission.
Street means a right-of-way for vehicular whether designated as street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, road, avenue, drive, expressway, boulevard, lane, place, circle, alley, or otherwise.
(1)
Interstate principal arterial means interstates and other fully controlled access facilities.
(2)
Urban principal arterial means streets and highways serving major urban activity centers, the highest traffic volume corridors, the longest trip desires, and a high proportion of total urban area travel on a minimum of mileage. Service to abutting land should be subordinate to the provision of travel service to major traffic movements. This system carries the major portion of trips entering and leaving an urban area, as well as the majority of through movements desiring to bypass the central city, and normally will carry important intra-urban as well as intercity bus routes.
(3)
Urban minor arterial means streets and highways interconnecting with and augmenting the urban principal arterial system and providing service to trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of travel mobility. The system places more emphasis on land access and distributes travel to geographic areas smaller than these identified with the higher system. It includes all arterials not classified as principal.
(4)
Urban collector street means streets penetrating neighborhoods, collecting traffic from local streets in the neighborhoods, and channeling it into the arterial systems. A minor amount of through traffic may be carried on collector streets, but the system primarily provides land access service and carries local traffic movements within residential neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial areas. It may also serve local bus routes.
(5)
Local street means streets not classified in a higher system, primarily providing direct access to abutting land and access to the higher systems. They offer the lowest level of mobility and usually carry no bus routes. Service to through traffic is deliberately discouraged.
(6)
Bypass means a highway designated for fast, continuous movement of all types of traffic between highways and widely separated parts of the urban area. Bypasses generally have limited or controlled access and are usually grade-separated at railroads and major crossings.
(7)
Alley or service drive means a minor access way used for service access, or property access under specified circumstances, to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
(8)
Marginal access street means a residential street parallel and adjacent to major thoroughfares or arterial streets and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic.
(9)
Cul-de-sac means a local street or road with only one outlet and having an appropriate terminal for the safe and convenient reversal of traffic movement.
(10)
Half-street means a street or road adjacent to a subdivision tract boundary where only half the required right-of-way and road improvements are provided within the proposed subdivision and the responsibility for the other half is undecided or is left to the adjacent property owner.
Subdivider means and includes any person, firm or corporation or agent who undertakes the subdivision of land as defined in this section.
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets, and included resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or areas subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards set forth in these regulations.
(2)
The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved.
(3)
The transfer of property by the owner to a member of the immediate family to include within the fifth degree as established by the legal definition.
(4)
The transfer of unsubdivided land or the transfer of a lot of parcel of land established by deed or plat recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court prior to the effective date of these regulations.
(5)
The division of land among heirs by judicial decree.
The planning commission shall have the authority to waive the design criteria of these regulations in cases of subdivisions substantially developed prior to the adoption of these regulations and where notification that the subdivision has been started is made to the planning commission within ten days of the date of adoption.
Suburban subdivision means a subdivision located outside the City of Dalton which meets all the following criteria:
(1)
Lot size - 25,000 square feet or larger.
(2)
Lot width - 125 feet or more.

Sec. 102-7. - Violations.
Whenever it shall come to the attention of the city that any provision of this chapter has been or is being violated, the city may immediately institute suit and prosecute the same to final judgment.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-8. - Conflict with other laws.
Whenever the provisions of this chapter impose more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other statute, ordinance provision or resolution, the regulations herein contained shall prevail. Whenever the provisions of any other statute, ordinance provision or resolution require more restrictive standards than are required herein the requirements of such regulation shall prevail.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-9. - Penalties.
Pursuant to law, any person convicted of violating this chapter or any provision thereof shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 60 days, or both.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-10. - Variance.
Upon the recommendation of the director of public works, the mayor and council are authorized to grant such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where owing to physical or environment conditions the strict application of any section of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship on any owner of a specific property. In granting a variance the mayor and council may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purposes of this section. An undue hardship shall not be a situation resulting from the owner's own direct or indirect making.

1 All streets must be curbed and guttered meeting city public works specifications.
2 A ten-foot easement on each side of the constructed street width may be substituted for rights-of-way on local streets only. In such cases, the right-of-way is equal to the construction width from back-of-curb and set back distances are measured from the easement line. Such easements must meet the requirements of the public works department and city utilities. Parking is allowed within such easements, but not on public rights-of-way.
3 Measured from back-of-curb to back-of-curb. Street construction widths are constant from intersection to intersection or from intersection to the cul-de-sac turnaround.
4 Measured distance is between points four feet above the centerline of the street.
5 Measured distance is to the centerline of the street.
6 Cul-de-sac streets with 12 or less dwellings may reduce rights-of-way to 44 feet and construction width to 24 feet.
      (11)
Alleys. Alleys with a minimum right-of-way of 20 feet shall be provided in the rear of all lots to be used for business purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. Where alleys are permitted they shall be graded and surfaced to specifications approved by the city and/or county engineer.
(12)
Split-level streets. Streets which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way shall provide a paved traffic surface of at least 20 feet on each level and a slope between the two traffic ways not less than 3:1.

(1)
Nonresidential blocks. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for their prospective use.
(2)
Residential block length. In order that there may be convenient access between various parts of a subdivision and between the subdivision and surrounding areas; and in order to help prevent traffic congestion and undue inconvenience; the length of blocks hereafter established shall not exceed 1,800 feet or be less than 600 feet. Provided, however, such length requirements may be modified when such shall be appropriate due to the topography or physical shape of the property being subdivided.
(3)
Residential block width. The width of any residential block shall be sufficient to permit two tiers of lots, where topography and land ownership permits, except as otherwise provided in these regulations.
(4)
Crosswalks. Rights-of-way for pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided when in the opinion of the planning commission crosswalks are necessary for the convenience of pedestrians. Such rights-of-way shall be not less than ten feet wide.

Sec. 102-64. - Lots.
All lots which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards:
(1)
Authority of health department Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as preventing the health department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision shall not be built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in these regulations are inadequate and must be increased to ensure the protection of the public health.
(2)
Building lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 25 feet from the front property line on lots abutting marginal access or minor residential streets, 40 feet from the front property line on lots abutting collector streets. Residential lots shall not be platted to front directly on the right-of-way of a major highway unless such right-of-way contains a marginal access street. Appendix A, part I, article XI, is adopted in this subsection by reference.
(3)
City limit and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by corporate boundary lines.
(4)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of building so as to conform with the building lines on both streets.
(5)
Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from railroad or major street rights-of-way or where necessary due to topography. Where a railroad of major arterial right-of-way, as shown on the major thoroughfare plan, abuts or runs through any portion of the subdivision, the subdivision plan shall provide for either a marginal access or lots backing onto said right-of-way having a minimum depth of 200 feet.
(6)
Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.
(7)
Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot with at the front building line and minimum lot area shall be as required in appendix A, part I. Any lot requiring a septic tank shall be governed by the regulations of the county health department.
(8)
Street access. Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and conforms to the requirements of these regulations.
(9)
Lot depth. Except in instances of extreme topography or other unusual physical conditions, lot depth shall not be more than four times the lot width at the building line.
Sec. 102-65. - Easements.
Easements shall be required in subdivisions for the following purpose:
(1)
Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 12 feet in width and where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines.
(2)
Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of the watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose.
(Ord. of 2-20-1967)
Sec. 102-66. - Variances.
When, due to the peculiar shape, or the topography of a tract of land or other unusual condition, it is impractical for a developer to comply with the literal interpretations of the design requirements of these regulations, the planning commission shall be authorized to vary such requirements provided the intent and purposes of these regulations are not violated.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 07-21, § 1, adopted Sept. 17, 2007, repealed the former Art. IV, §§ 102-91—102-101, and enacted a new Art. IV, as set out herein. The former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ordinance adopted Feb. 20, 1967.

Sec. 102-91. - Findings; duty of subdivider.
A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve his subdivision.
(Ord. No. 07-21, § 1, 9-17-2007)
Sec. 102-92. - Monuments.
Concrete monuments at least four inches in diameter or square, three feet long, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle points and points of curve in each street, and at points of change of direction in the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify the location or other type monuments approved by the planning commission and shall be set flush or up to six inches above the finished grade. All other lot corners shall be marked with an iron pipe at least 24 inches long and driven flush or up to six inches above the finished grade.
(Ord. No. 07-21, § 1, 9-17-2007)
Sec. 102-93. - Natural gas.
When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.
(Ord. No. 07-21, § 1, 9-17-2007)
Sec. 102-94. - Water supply.
Where public water is available adjacent to the property being subdivided, the subdivider shall install water mains and fire hydrants according to plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city and/or county official and approved by the health department. When the water main is located in the street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced.
