ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND SCOPE

Sec. [1.1] - Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide standards to safeguard public health, property, and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, construction, erection, maintenance, and quality of materials of all exterior signs, and to ensure that signs will not confuse, mislead, or obstruct the vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety.
The City of Dalton ("city") acknowledges, too, that preservation of the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizenry of the city requires the preservation and protection of the visual attractiveness and aesthetic characteristics of existing streets and neighborhoods throughout the community. Signage controls are included in this ordinance to further the aesthetic values of the community by:
(1)
Protecting neighborhood property values;
(2)
Maintaining the traditional character of historic neighborhoods and districts;
(3)
Avoiding the visual degradation of the city's irreplaceable scenic and environmental resources; and
(4)
Promoting city's continued economic growth by encouraging high quality commercial development.
Reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs provides vital support for economic development and helps create a positive community image that will attract desirable business and industry to the Dalton area. The uncontrolled use of signs with their variable sizes, heights, and illumination demand attention to help avoid potential dangers to moving traffic and pedestrians. In addition, uncontrolled sign placements can be destructive to adjacent property values so that clutter replaces the intrinsic values of the property and diminishes the effectiveness of the signs as they compete with each other. Absent regulations, competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message to the public.
For these reasons, it has become necessary in the public interest to regulate the sizes, heights, locations, types, and other pertinent physical features of exterior signs in the city while simultaneously acknowledging free speech as a First Amendment constitutional right. Balancing the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs, while protecting the right of the public against unrestricted proliferation of signs, is acknowledged as the goal of the city. Such reasonable regulations also further the policy implementation of the city's adopted comprehensive plan, especially regarding impacts on quality land use development in the area.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS

Sec. 2.1 - For the purpose of this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply.
Aggregate sign area: The area of all signs on a parcel, wall or window, as the case may be, excluding the area of one face of all double-faced signs.
Animated sign: A sign with action, motion, or changing colors that requires electrical energy. This definition includes any signs that electronically change the sign face, whether by substitution of copy or scrolling.
Awning: A permanently installed cloth, canvas, or rigid roof-like covering which hangs from a building facade or projects over the public sidewalk for the purpose of beautifying a building facade or sheltering pedestrians from sun or rain. (Also, see "Canopy.")
Banner: A type of sign intended to be hung either with or without frames, possessing characters, letters, illustrations, or ornamentations applied to paper, plastic, or fabric of any kind.
Business premises: A building, suite, office or other unit used for nonresidential purposes. For businesses licensed by the city, the area occupied by a single business license holder shall be deemed as one business premises. Each professional corporation, partnership or other entity in which the professional participates shall be considered the occupant and all area so occupied shall be the business premises. For the purpose of this ordinance, business premises shall include nonresidential space occupied by charitable organizations, political organizations, institutions, or other noncommercial entities.
Canopy: A roof-like structure supported by columns or projecting from a building and open on at least three-sides. A canopy may also be detached from a building as a free-standing structure.

(a)
For a sign, either free-standing or attached, the area shall be considered to include all lettering, wording, and accompanying design and symbols, together with the background, whether open or enclosed, (with or without trim), on which they are displayed, but not including any supporting framework and bracing which are incidental to the display itself;
(b)
For a sign painted upon or applied to a building, the area shall be considered to include all lettering, wording, and accompanying designs or symbols together with any background of a different color than the natural color of the building;
(c)
Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to or painted on a surface, building, canopy, awning, wall or window, the area shall be considered to be that of the smallest rectangle or other geometric shape which encompasses all of the letters or symbols.
Facade: The face of a building which, because of its architectural details, is clearly intended to be viewed by the public. The front facade is the building wall which customarily contains the primary entry of the building.
Flag: Any fabric or bunting containing colors, patterns, or symbols used to signify a government or other entity or organization.
Frontage, building: The width in linear feet of each exterior wall of a business which faces a public or private street right-of way.

3.1-1 It shall be unlawful to erect or place any sign that does not conform to the requirement of this ordinance or as otherwise provided for nonconforming signs by this ordinance.
3.1-2 The requirements of this ordinance shall apply to all signs that are visible from a street, public right-of-way, or property in public ownership, regardless of zoning district.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 3.2 - Measuring signs.
3.2-1 Display area. See definition for display area in article ii of this ordinance. The display area is measured geometrically in square feet, and is the area within the smallest regular geometric shape that contains the entire sign copy. The maximum allowed sign size of this ordinance requires the summation of multiple display areas mounted on any sign structure that are readable from a single direction.
3.2-2 Height of signs. Except, as otherwise provided in this ordinance, the height of a sign at its highest point above the level of the ground may be no greater than 40 feet above the adjacent ground. The following rules shall apply in determining adjacent ground: If the base of the sign structure is below the grade of the adjacent roadway, the sign height is measured from the elevation of the adjacent roadway that is nearest to the sign structure. The ground shall not be altered for the sole purpose of providing additional sign height.
3.2-3 Setback. For the purposes of this ordinance, the setback requirements reference the minimum distance from a street right-of-way line required for the placement of a sign structure. For side or rear line setbacks in all zone districts, a sign structure shall comply with a minimum setback of ten feet from the property line, but in no case shall the sign structure be placed on or the sign display area extend across any property line, required buffer, or over a public right-of-way, except as may be allowed in the C-3 zone district.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 3.3 - Lighting restrictions.
3.3-1 The light from illuminated signs shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways.
3.3-2 No illuminated signs shall be constructed or maintained within 50 feet of any dwelling within a residential district.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)

3.4-2 Rotating signs which include a standard sign rotating devise designated to rotate at a rate of less than six revolutions per minutes shall be permitted within all nonresidential districts.
3.4-3 Signs may be mounted back to back when they share the same structure and only one side (the larger side if of unequal dimensions) shall be considered in computing the display area dimensions.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 3.5 - Corner visibility clearance.
In any district, no sign or sign structure (above a height of four feet) shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. However, a sign structure (example: pole support) not more than ten inches in diameter, if located on a corner lot where services are provided to the motoring public, may be located within the required corner visibility area if all other requirements of this article are met and the lowest elevation of the sign face is at least ten feet above the ground level.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)

Sec. 4.2 - Permanent signs.
The following sign types require the issuance of permits unless otherwise stated by this ordinance.
4.2-1 Freestanding signs. Such signs shall only be located on property in multi-family residential, commercial, or industrially zoned areas, unless otherwise stated. The display area of such signs shall not extend over a public right-of-way line or property line. Those pole signs having all of the display area ten feet or more above ground level when measured from the grade at the right-of-way line may be erected so that the display areas abut the right-of-way line. Signs, with any portion of the display area less than ten feet above ground level, must be erected at least ten feet from the right-of-way line.
4.2-2 Ground signs. Allowed in multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial zone districts, a ground sign is a freestanding sign, provided that it does not exceed three feet in height, and is no bigger than 36 square feet in area, measured on one side only. Ground signs must be set back at least three feet from the public right-of-way. Freestanding signs in the C-1A zone district are limited to ground signs.
4.2-3 Wall. Wall signs (including signs attached flat against the wall and painted wall signs) shall be securely fastened by metal supports to the building surface along the sign's greatest dimension. They may project from the building 12 inches, provided that, if they project more than four inches from the building surface, they shall maintain a clear height of eight feet above the ground level. Wall signs may not extend more than four feet above the parapet wall. A wall sign may be permitted on an existing building that does not meet the setback requirement provided that the sign meets all other requirements of this section and is not located within the right-of-way.
(a)
Signs on the facades of the building. Except, as otherwise provided below, the total aggregate area of wall signs on the exterior front surface of a business premise shall not exceed 20 percent of front surface of the business or 200 square feet, whichever is less. The total aggregate area of wall signs on a side or rear surface of a business premise shall not exceed 25 percent of the exterior side or rear surface of the business respectively or 200 square feet, whichever is less. The maximum size of a wall sign for a residential dwelling is 15 square feet and for a multi-family residential project/development is 50 square feet.
(b)
Larger buildings. A nonresidential building containing an area of 50,000 square feet, or more, may have multiple wall signs on any facade of the building, not exceeding ten percent of any facade, but the total number of such signs count as one allowable sign per facade.
4.2-4 Window signs. The aggregate sign area (permanent and/or temporary window signs) for each ground level window shall not exceed 30 percent of the window area. Window signs on or above the second floor are prohibited except when a business has no ground floor frontage, then, in such event the provisions of this subsection 4.2-4 shall apply.
4.2-5 Projecting signs. Projecting signs shall be securely fastened by metal supports to the building surface along the sign's greatest dimension. They may project from the building wall no more than five feet to the outside edge of the sign. Projecting signs are not permitted at the intersection of corners, except at right angles to the building front, unless otherwise authorized by this ordinance.
(a)
The maximum size of a projecting sign is 40 square feet in commercial and industrial zone districts where such signs are allowed; however, in the downtown historic district the maximum size is limited to six square feet. In the C-3 zone district, projecting signs may overhang the R/W as long as a clear height of eight feet is maintained above the ground, a sidewalk, or pedestrian walkway. Projecting signs are prohibited on all residentially used and zoned properties.
4.2-6 Canopy signs. Such signs shall not exceed eight square feet in size and shall be not less than eight feet above the ground at the lowest extremity of the sign.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 4.3 - Temporary signs.
Signage may periodically be needed for a short duration rather than permanent usage. To avoid the unfettered proliferation of signage that could easily contribute to litter and blight to the detriment of property values and business opportunity in all zone districts, the city finds it necessary to manage such signage with the issuance of permits that are tied to a prescribed set of rules for the various signs that may fall in this particular category. These signs shall not be erected within the public right-of-way and shall be located on private property with the permission of the property owner. Only one permit shall be issued to cover all temporary signs.
The maximum number of temporary permits to be issued to a single parcel in a multi-family, commercial, or industrial district shall be four per year for a period of time not to exceed 30 days for each permit issued. No more than one temporary permit shall be issued per calendar quarter per applicant.
Banners are allowable as temporary signs.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 4.4 - Signs exempt from permit requirements.
4.4-1 The following types of signs shall be exempt from the permit requirements of section 8.1 of this ordinance:
(a)
Freestanding sign, having a sign area of less than 15 square feet, provided it is not located in the public right-of-way, does not block vehicle sight visibility, does not exceed three feet in height if a ground sign, or, if a pole sign, does not exceed six feet in height.
(b)
Temporary window sign. Provided, however, the aggregate sign area (permanent and/or temporary window signs) shall not exceed 30 percent of the available window space.
(c)
Seasonal displays located outside of the public right-of-way that are erected for a maximum period of 30 days no more than twice a year.
4.4-2 Flagpoles in residential zoned districts shall not exceed 25 feet in height or the height of the primary structure, whichever is less. Flagpoles in commercial or industrial zoned districts shall not exceed 60 feet in height. The dimensions of any flag shall be proportional to the flagpole height such that the hoist side of the flag shall not exceed 50 percent of the vertical height.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 4.5 - Use of signs by zone districts.
4.5-1 Residential districts.
(a)
Platted residential subdivisions may erect one monument sign at each entrance to the subdivision. Such sign shall not exceed a height of five feet above the grade level of the centerline of the adjacent street and shall not have a sign area greater than 25 square feet.

(3)
Unless otherwise stated in this ordinance, parcels less than 30,000 square feet in size shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of 100 square feet for the entire parcel.
(4)
These limits shall include the area of all freestanding signs on the parcel.
(b)
Residential uses in the commercial and industrial districts shall comply with the signage requirements of subsection 4.5-1.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 4.6 - Billboard signs.
4.6-1 Billboard signs are allowed on commercial or industrial zoned parcels within the interstate corridor as provided herein.
4.6-2 The display area and trim of a billboard sign shall not exceed 12 feet in height and 50 feet in length or a display area in excess of 600 square feet.

(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
ARTICLE V. - HISTORIC DISTRICT SIGNAGE
This article applies only to historic districts officially designated by the mayor and council, now and in the future. The mayor and council have determined that the historical, cultural and aesthetic heritage of the city is among its most valued and important assets. In order to protect and preserve the historic districts of the city it is necessary to enact special regulations exclusively for said historic districts.

Sec. 5.1 - General regulations.
5.1-1 All definitions and other matters relating to signs as contained in other existing city ordinances shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that they are consistent with this ordinance. Restrictions and regulations specified under article IV of this ordinance apply within historic districts unless specific exceptions are made for the historic district.
5.1-2 Any sign proposed within a historic district is subject to design review by the building inspector.
5.1-3 Compatibility of signage with building architecture. Signage shall not be allowed to obscure any significant architectural details of a building face, nor shall a wall sign be allowed to cover existing windows.
5.1-4 Variances and appeals procedures. Sign-related appeals of negative findings by the historic preservation commission will be exempt from the appeals procedure described in section P of the city's historic preservation ordinance. The city zoning board of appeals will hear all sign related appeals. Appeals of negative findings by the historic preservation commission must be filed in writing with both the historic preservation commission and the zoning board of appeals no later than 15 days after the historic preservation commission mails the applicant a written notice stating that his application for a certification of appropriateness has been denied.
5.1-5 Property lines. No sign shall be closer than 18 inches to the adjacent property lines. Signs shall not be installed or extend over a party wall.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 5.2 - Types of permitted signs.
5.2-1 Canopy and wall signs. The maximum combined square footage of wall and canopy signs placed on the facade of a building by any business will be 150 square feet for one or two story building and 200 square feet for buildings of three stories or more, or ten percent of the building facade area, whichever is less.
For each business occupying an entire building, the sign area of any wall sign or canopy sign (or any combination of wall and canopy signs) placed on a building facade may not exceed ten percent of the building facade area. The "building facade area" is calculated by multiplying the height of the facade by the width of the facade and subtracting the area devoted to windows. (See Illustration No. 1.)
For any building which houses multiple businesses, the "building facade area" used to calculate maximum size of wall and canopy signs allowed for each business will be defined as the individual business's linear frontage (on the primary facade) less the area of any window glass, times the height of the building as measured at its highest point above the business's frontage. (See Illustration No. 2).
Illustration No. 2

  5.2-2 Window signs. For a ground level business, 15 percent of the total window area parallel to the street may be used as one of the allowable signs. No single window may be covered in excess of 30 percent. Window signs on or above the second floor are prohibited except when a business has no ground floor frontage.
Window signs on the second floor will be limited to identification and instructional signs which cover no more than 15 percent of the entire window area above the ground floor and no more than 30 percent of any one window.
5.2-3 Ground signs. In zoning districts that allow freestanding signs, a ground sign may be used provided that the following additional restrictions apply to ground signs within historic districts:
(1)
Not internally illuminated;
(2)
Constructed of materials consistent with the building architecture.
5.2-4 Illuminated signs. Except, in residential zoning districts, signs may be illuminated internally or with indirect lighting provided that indirect light sources are shielded from other buildings and do not create glare or visual discomfort to pedestrians at street level. Neon window and wall signs are permitted as long as they conform to the restrictions listed under subsection 5.3-6.

ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING USES
Except, as otherwise provided in this ordinance, all signs shall be subject to the provisions below, governing nonconforming uses. Such provisions, however, shall not be construed to prevent a legally operating nonconforming use from using signs otherwise permitted for similar conforming uses.

Sec. 6.1 - Continuance of nonconforming uses.
The lawful use of land area or sign structure existing at the time of enactment of or subsequent amendment to this ordinance may be continued subject to the following restrictions even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this ordinance.
Existing nonconforming sign structures shall not be:
(a)
Changed to another nonconforming sign;
(b)
Torn down and rebuilt or moved and rebuilt as a nonconforming sign;
(c)
Extended or enlarged; or
(d)
Rebuilt, altered, or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of the improvements, except when changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign nonconforming or warrant the sign's repair.
For the purpose of administration of this provision ordinary maintenance of a sign is not deemed to be or constitute an extension or enlargement of the sign; and changing the face of the sign is not deemed a change prohibited by this section.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 6.2 - Deterioration.
Nonconforming signs which have been allowed to deteriorate so as to constitute either an aesthetic nuisance or a safety hazard are subject to removal pursuant to article VIII of this ordinance. A sign shall be deemed to be deteriorated if the paint on its face is faded, cracked or peeling, if removable letters on the changeable copy board are missing or in disarray, if plastic panels are missing, broken or stained, if the sign face or its supporting frame work is rusty or in need of paint, if the area surrounding the sign base is not maintained and kept free of weeds and debris, or if the sign is in need of structural repair.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 6.3 - Abandonment.
Nonconforming signs which have been abandoned, shall be removed in their entirety by the record owner of the building or the person who obtained the sign license, whichever owns the sign or portion thereof, within 90 days after the business using the sign closes or ceases to operate on the premises where the sign is located.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 6.4 - Relocation of existing nonconforming sign.
Notwithstanding the limitation on existing nonconforming sign structures set out in section 6.1 of this article, the mayor and council are authorized to permit an existing nonconforming sign structure to be relocated and rebuilt upon the same or contiguous parcel if the mayor and council determine that such relocation would:
(a)
Enhance the aesthetic value, economic value, or future development potential of the effected property;
(b)
Not increase any dimension of the original existing nonconforming sign structure;
(c)
Not require any extension to the then-existing lease term, if any, of the nonconforming sign structure; and
(d)
Not violate applicable zoning restrictions or permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 09-23, § 1, 9-7-2009)
ARTICLE VII. - APPEALS

Sec. 7.1 - Procedure.
An applicant whose permit application has been denied or a permittee who alleges that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector or any other administrative official in connection with the enforcement of this ordinance, may appeal the decision to the Dalton-Whitfield Board of Zoning Appeals. Any such appeal shall be governed by and in accordance with the procedures set forth in article XIV of the city's zoning ordinance.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 12-05, § 1, 7-2-2012)
Sec. 7.2 - Powers.
The zoning board of appeals shall have the power to reverse or amend the decision of the building inspector, and/or authorize a variance from the strict application of this ordinance where such application will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships to the person owning or having the beneficial use of the property or sign for which the variance is sought.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 7.3 - Application of the variance power.
A variance may be allowed by the board of appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings:
(1)
That the alleged hardships or practical difficulties or both, are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city.
(2)
That the alleged hardships and practical difficulties, or both, which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, inability to attain a higher financial return, or both.
(3)
That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done:
(a)
Considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this ordinance;
(b)
The individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the board to grant a variance; and
(c)
The rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance.
(4)
That the requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.
(5)
That granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this ordinance.
The above findings of fact shall be made by the board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact on the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the board.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to empower the board of appeals to change the terms of this ordinance or to add to the uses permitted in any district.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
ARTICLE VIII. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 8.1 - Sign permit.
8.1-1 A sign permit is required before a permanent or temporary/special event sign may be erected or attached to, suspended from or supported on a building or structure; and before an existing sign may be enlarged, relocated or materially improved upon to an extent of 60 percent of its total replacement value. All signs using electrical wiring and connections shall require an electrical permit.
8.1-2 A sign permit shall be issued by the building inspector when the plans, specifications and intended use of the permanent sign or part thereof conform in all respects to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, the city building code, and the requirements of the electrical code as certified by the building inspector and a permit fee has been paid by the applicant. The administrative application shall be accompanied by plans or such other information as the building inspector may reasonably require in the exercise of his duties. In no event shall the building inspector require the applicant to submit the content of the proposed sign as a condition of issuing a permit. Standardized sign plans may be filed with the building inspector in fulfillment of this requirement, although site plans to determine the location of a sign shall be filed with each application. The building inspector shall process the application and either grant or deny the application within 30 business days from the date of receipt of a complete application and payment of the proper fee. The failure of building inspector to timely act on the application shall be deemed a grant of the application.
8.1-3 [Reserved.]
8.1-4 Each permit application shall contain an agreement to indemnify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses, which may in any manner be caused by the sign(s) or sign structure.
8.1-5 The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that either do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance, are incomplete applications or are applications containing false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was erroneously issued, then such permit is void ab initio. Denial of a permit shall be communicated to the sign applicant in writing by the building inspector before the end of the 30 business days established for review of the application and shall state the reasons for denial of the application. For the purposes of this ordinance, the communication may be made by email or facsimile. Alternatively, the city may serve the sign applicant personally with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 business days after the city's receipt of the application. The sign applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a permit to the city's zoning board of appeals by written notice of appeal as provided in section 7.1 above.
8.1-6 A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within a period of six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign and a sign is later desired in the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of reapplication.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 8.2 - Permit fee.
8.2-1 A permit fee shall be paid to the building inspector for each permit required by this ordinance. The fee shall be in accordance to the rate schedule maintained in the office of the building inspector. No permit shall be issued until the exact dimensions and area of the sign have been filed with the building inspector.
8.2-2 Permit fees shall not apply to the ordinary servicing, repainting of existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, nor to changing of advertising on a sign specifically designed for periodic change of message without change in structure.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 8.3 - Construction and maintenance.
All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors, shall be kept in constant repair and unless constructed of galvanized or non-corroding metal, shall be periodically given a protective coating. The area immediately in front of all freestanding signs shall be maintained free of high weeds and debris. In addition to the above provisions, the building inspector may cause any sign or structure which:
(a)
Is structurally unsafe; or
(b)
Constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment; or
(c)
Is not kept in good repair; or
(d)
Is capable of causing electrical shocks, to be removed following notice of 24-hours to the owner, at the expense of the owner thereof, and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 8.4 - Enforcement.
If any sign is erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this ordinance, the building inspector shall have the power to give the owner thereof written notice of such violation, said notice to include a brief statement of the particulars in which such violation is to be remedied. If a sign has been registered with the building inspector, notice to the registered owner or the person or firm receiving the permit shall be sufficient. If a sign has not been registered and the owner is not known, affixing a copy of the notice to the sign, graphic structure, or building for a period of ten days shall be sufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the interest of safety, any official or employee of the city shall have the authority to remove and dispose of any sign placed within the public right-of-way without notice to the owner.
If such a violation is not remedied within 30 days after such notice, the owner shall remove the sign immediately or be subject to a $100.00 a day fine for each day the sign remains. If the sign is not removed by the owner, the building inspector shall have the right to remove such sign at the expense of the owner thereof and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 8.5 - New zoning districts.
If a new zoning district is created after the initial enactment of this ordinance or subsequent amendment, no signs shall be permitted therein until this ordinance shall be amended to include such zone district.
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009)
Sec. 8.6 - Delegation.
The mayor and council are authorized to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the county to provide for the administration and enforcement of the sign ordinance of the city by the building inspection department of the county. For so long as such intergovernmental agreement is in effect the term "building inspector" as used in the sign ordinance of the city shall mean the building inspector of the county or his designee. At all times, and in any event, the city police department is authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 09-31, § 1, 9-21-2009)
ARTICLE IX. - ADOPTION AND AMENDMENTS
