(Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010; Ord. No. O-172-14, § 1, 8-21-2014)
Sec. 42-269. - Minimum tree density requirements.
(a)
Overview. A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 40 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree".
The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development, except as otherwise stated for single-family residential lots. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula:
SDF = EDF + RDF
Where:
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (40 units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
(b)
Site density factor. The site density factor (SDF) is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 40. Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 40 = 88.
(c)
Existing density factor. The existing density factor (EDF) is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. This is done using Table A below.

13 1.8 25 6.8 37 15.0 49 26.2
14 2.2 26 7.4 38 15.8 50 27.2
  Note: Tree diameter for existing trees is measured at 4.5 feet above the ground. Tree diameter fractions may be "rounded up" if 0.5 inches or greater, or "rounded down" if less than 0.5 inches.
Example:
A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site. The tree inventory is as follows:
7—12″ diameter maples
3—14″ diameter gums
3—18″ diameter pines
1—21″ diameter oak
1—30″ diameter oak
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as shown in the following table:
EXPAND
Scientific Name Common Name DBH Units No. of Trees Totals
Acer barbatum Florida Maple 12″ 1.6 × 7 =       11.2
Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo, grafted 14″ 2.2 × 3 =       6.6
Pinus strobes White Pine 18″ 3.6 × 3 =       10.8
Quercus alba White Oak 21″ 4.8 × 1 =       4.8
Quercus falcate Southern Red Oak 30″ 9.8 × 1 =       9.8
43.2
  (d)
Replacement density factor.
(1)
Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF) by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
Example: RDF = 70.4 - 43.2 = 27.2
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table B. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RDF and the species list is accepted by the OEO.
(2)
All replacement trees shall be selected from either the city-maintained canopy tree list or understory tree list.

Sec. 42-270. - Specimen trees.
(a)
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. The following criteria are used by the OEO or city arborist to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify.
(1)
Overstory trees such as oaks, hickories, poplars, sweet gums or other large hardwoods must be at least 28 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree.
(2)
Small native flowering trees must be at least 12 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree.
(3)
Softwood trees such as pines must be at least 30 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree.
(4)
Condition criteria.
a.
Life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
b.
Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay.
c.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs.
d.
No major insect or pathological problems.
e.
No major pruning deficiencies, i.e. topping.
f.
At least 75 percent of the critical root zone in a natural, undisturbed state.
g.
Native flowering tree if considered a rare species.
(b)
On all sites, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention location and the like.
(c)
In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned value shown in Table A in section 42-269(c).
(d)
On all sites, if a specimen tree must be removed, it shall be replaced by a species with potential for comparable size and quality. All specimen trees removed must be replaced at a density of two times the unit value of the tree removed, i.e., 30-inch diameter specimen trees (9.8 density units) must be replaced with 19.6 units. Species selection is subject to the approval of the OEO or city arborist.
(e)
No specimen tree may be removed without prior written approval from the OEO. Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the OEO must be replaced by trees with a minimum caliper size of five inches per tree with a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed. The area that encompassed the critical root zone of the specimen tree shall remain undisturbed to allow for the planting of replacement trees. In addition, the OEO may issue a citation for the removal of a specimen tree without the appropriate city review and approval. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval.
(f)
On all sites except single family detached residential lots, the OEO or city arborist may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one or more specimen tree and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed.
(Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010; Ord. No. O-172-14, § 1, 8-21-2014)
Sec. 42-271. - Alternative compliance.
(a)
Generally. The intent of this article is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. In this case, the OEO may approve placement or replacement on another property, either private or public, or monetary compensation in the form of payment to the city's tree replacement fund.
(b)
Standards. The following standards have been established for administering these alternatives:
(1)
The OEO must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance.
(2)
In no instance shall 100 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance.
(3)
As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question.
(4)
No permit shall be issued until any required payment has been made to the tree replacement fund.
(5)
The amount per tree density unit to be paid to the tree replacement fund shall be set by resolution of the city council.
(6)
The tree replacement fund shall be used for planting trees on public property or on approved private property, environmental education, management of the tree preservation program, and related purposes.

(b)
Prior to commencement of any grading, construction or tree removal, a tree protection area for any tree located within 25 feet of any proposed grading, construction or tree removal must be established by physical barrier and maintained until such work is completed.
(Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010)
Sec. 42-273. - Tree preservation standards.
(a)
Every property owner or occupant shall be responsible for the normal care of trees located on such property. Willful injury or disfigurement of any tree growing within the city shall be a violation of this ordinance. No person shall:
(1)
Pour any material on a tree or on nearby ground which could be harmful to the tree;
(2)
Cause or encourage any unnecessary fire or burning near or around any tree;
(3)
Cut off air, light, or water from the roots;
(4)
Pile building material or equipment around any tree so as to cause injury thereto.
(b)
Prior to any tree removal or commencement of construction on a site to be developed, the following system shall be used:
(1)
Location and types of tree protection devices.
a.
Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all the trees to be preserved.
b.
The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or passive.
c.
Active protection (see material section below) is required where tree save areas are located in proximity to construction activity.
d.
Passive protection (see material section below) may be used in more remote locations and in all protected zones not designated as tree save areas.
e.
All tree save areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area.
f.
The locations and installation of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. All tree protection devices must be maintained intact throughout construction.
g.
Once protected zones are established and approved, any changes are subject to review by the city.
(2)
Materials.
a.
Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing, where tree trunks are in jeopardy of being damaged by equipment, the ordinance enforcement officer shall require two-inch by four-inch boards to be strapped around the trunks of trees. In addition, where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with blue colored water-based paint.
b.
Passive protection shall consist of heavy mil. plastic flagging, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters on a bright background reading "Tree Protection Area - Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint.
(c)
Installation and removal. All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The ordinance enforcement officer must inspect the installation of tree protection, erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to the issuance of the tree removal permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued.

Sec. 42-274. - Tree damage.
Any tree designated in the plan to be saved that is damaged during construction or as a result of such construction, shall be treated according to accepted National Arborists Association Standards, or replaced with a tree(s) equal to the unit value of the tree removed. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with a tree(s) two times the unit value of the tree removed.
(Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010)
Sec. 42-275. - Tree planting standards.
(a)

(1)
Recommended canopy/overstory tree list.
(2)
Recommended parking lot and street tree species list.
(3)
Recommended understory tree list.
(4)
Recommended hedgerow plant list.
Trees may be administratively added to or deleted from these lists upon the advice of the city arborist.
(b)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability.
(c)
It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed when practical.
(d)
Except on single-family detached residential lots, trees selected for planting to comply with minimum requirements must be at least six feet tall at the time of planting.
(e)
To ensure variety in design, no more than 35 percent of replacement trees shall be of a single species, and no more than 25 percent of replacement trees shall be an evergreen species.
(Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010)
Sec. 42-276. - Mandatory removal of dead, diseased, and potentially dangerous trees.
If the OEO deems a tree located on private property or in the public right-of-way or in public areas to be dead, dying, diseased, or in a potentially dangerous condition to the public or adjacent properties, the tree may be declared a nuisance. Upon determining that any tree upon private property is a nuisance, the OEO shall notify the property owner in writing, describing the condition, stating the actions necessary for correction, and setting forth a reasonable time in which the action must be taken. Actions required to cure and abate a nuisance, as described above, may include any reasonable technique, method, or procedure to cure the nuisance, including if necessary, the removal of the tree. In a declared emergency situation, the city has the right to immediately remove dangerous trees, or parts thereof, from private or public property.
