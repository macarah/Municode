Sec. 2-185. - Ordinance enforcement procedures
(a)
Purpose. This chapter shall provide for ordinance enforcement procedures as set forth below.
(b)
Process. Ordinance violations may be enforced by the ordinance enforcement officer (OEO) or any city employee and may be reported by any person. The person reporting the violation should direct their report to the OEO. In the event that the only evidence of a violation is from a reporting person and a citation is ultimately issued, the reporting person should know that he or she may be called to testify in municipal court as to the violation. The OEO should make an effort to personally confirm the existence of a violation and must verify that the reported offense is in violation of a city ordinance.
Once the OEO determines that there is a violation of a city ordinance, the OEO shall send a notice to the offending person named in the violation. The notice must be sent on City of Berkeley Lake letterhead and must include: the date of the notice; the name of the offending person; a brief description of the violation; the date the violation was observed and/or reported; the chapter and section of the ordinance that has been violated; a deadline by which the offending person must remedy the violation; consequence(s) should the violation not be remedied; the OEO's name, title and signature; and a copy of the actual city ordinance referenced. At the OEO's discretion, the notice shall be sent via regular mail, certified mail, registered mail, hand-delivered or posted at a conspicuous place on the property for a period of 24 consecutive hours.
If the violation warrants, a citation shall be issued by the OEO. Also, if the offense is one for which the OEO has previously issued a letter requesting corrective action within a specified timeframe and the offending person has not complied with the request by the stated deadline, then a citation shall be issued by the OEO. The citation shall be hand-delivered by the OEO, and the citation must identify the City of Berkeley Lake as the issuing entity and must include: the date of the citation; the name of the offending person; a brief description of the violation; the date the violation was observed and/or reported; the chapter and section of the ordinance that has been violated; the date and time the offending person must appear in municipal court; the OEO's name, title and signature; and a copy of the actual city ordinance referenced. The OEO shall request that the offending person sign the citation to indicate receipt of the citation. If the offending person refuses to sign the citation, the OEO shall indicate such refusal on the citation. If the offending person cannot be located, the citation may be posted on the property and a copy shall be mailed via certified or registered mail to the last known address of the property owner or occupant.
(Ord. No. O-45-07, § 3-701, 4-19-2007)
Sec. 2-186. - Municipal court and fines.
On the date indicated on the citation, the municipal judge will hear the case and determine if the party was in violation of the cited ordinance. If the party is found in violation of city ordinance, the judge will render a decision regarding corrective action to be taken by the party and may impose fines for the violation plus appropriate court costs. Fines imposed will be in accordance with the city's Code, chapter 38 entitled "municipal court."
