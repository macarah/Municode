Sec. 78-366. - Variances; application for, procedure and notification.
(a)
Applications for variances.
(1)
All applications for variances shall be submitted initially, in writing, to the planning and zoning commission of the city, which shall consider these requests at its next called meeting. The planning and zoning commission may authorize such variance from the terms of this zoning chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest. The spirit of this chapter shall be observed, the public safety, health and welfare secured and substantial justice done. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or have authorized representation. Such variances may be granted in individual cases if the planning and zoning commission finds that:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and
b.
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and
c.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
d.
Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner; and
e.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public nor impair the purposes or intent of this chapter; and
f.
The variance is granted for a use of land or building or structure that is not prohibited by this chapter.
(2)
All applications for variances shall be made by submitting a completed variance application to city hall. Applicants shall include with their application a written explanation of how the subject property meets all the conditions detailed in subsections (1) a. through f.
(b)
Required notification. Before the planning and zoning commission acts upon an application for a variance:
(1)
The notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published at least 30 days and not more than 45 days prior to the hearing in the official organ of the county in which the sheriffs' advertisements are published.
(2)
The chair of the planning and zoning commission shall ensure that a sign is erected in a conspicuous place on the property involved, which shall contain information as to the variance applied for and the time and place of the hearing. This required sign shall be erected at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified shall invalidate any subsequent determination by the planning and zoning commission.
(3)
Written notice must be sent via first class mail to the subject property owner at least 30 days before the public hearing to be held by the planning commission. Written notices must indicate the nature of the proposed use or activity and the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing.
(c)
Expiration of approved variances. If applicable portions of this chapter have been amended or modified, or more than one year has elapsed, prior to the commencement of construction or other activity authorized by an approved variance request, a reapplication shall be required.

Sec. 78-367. - Administrative variance.
(a)
Generally. An administrative variance may be granted at the option of the chair of the planning and zoning commission for certain variance requests. Such variances must meet one of the following conditions and to be granted, the chair of the planning and zoning commission must conclude that the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance:
(1)
A variance to a numerically qualified ordinance limit where the request does not exceed ten percent of that limit;
(2)
A variance for a conforming change to a nonconforming structure where such change does not increase the impact of the existing nonconformance aspects.
(3)
Per subsection 78-366(c), a re-authorization of an expired variance if application is made within 12 months of the variance expiration. If more than 12 months has lapsed since variance expiration, or 24 months since variance approval, a hearing before the planning and zoning commission shall be required.
(b)
Required notification.
(1)
A notice shall be published in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published.
(2)
The chair of the planning and zoning commission shall ensure that a sign is erected in a conspicuous place on the property involved, which shall contain information as to the variance, its administrative approval, and the procedure for appeal. The variance becomes effective on the date the sign is erected and said sign must remain for a period of at least 15 days.
(3)
The administrative variance shall be reviewed at, and recorded in the minutes of, the next called meeting of the planning and zoning commission.
(c)
Limitations. An administrative variance may not be granted if any prior variances (granted or denied) were considered for the property involved within the last year. Multiple administrative variances are specifically not permitted.

(b)
When such exemptions are granted, conditions on construction, materials, fence height, transparency, and other attributes may be set. All other buffer restrictions must continue to be met or the buffer fencing exemption shall be vacated.
(c)
Buffer restrictions formally remain as they appear on the plat and property title. Buffer fencing exemptions apply only to action by the city and do not preclude action by other property owners.
(Code 2004, § 39-1401.3)
Sec. 78-369. - Appeals to the planning and zoning commission.
(a)
In cases of ordinance interpretations, planning and zoning commission chair decisions, enforcement officer or building inspector rulings, appeals to the planning and zoning commission may be made by any person aggrieved or by any official of the city affected by any decision of the ordinance enforcement, building inspector, or the planning and zoning commission chair. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days by filing with the ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission chair, depending from which body's decisions the appeal is made, and with the city clerk a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission chair shall promptly transmit to the planning and zoning commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission chair certifies that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in their opinion, cause immediate peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by the planning and zoning commission or by restraining order that may be granted by the superior court of the county.
(b)
Before the planning and zoning commission may act upon an appeal to review any grant or denial of a permit, interpretation, ruling or decision:
(c)
A public hearing shall be held thereon. A notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the hearing in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published.
(d)
The applicant for a special exception, variance or appeal shall erect in a conspicuous place on the property involved, a sign which shall contain information as to the special exception applied for or the ruling being appealed and the time and place of the hearing. This required sign shall be erected at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified above shall invalidate any subsequent determination by the mayor and council.
(e)
Written notice must be sent via first class mail to the subject property owner at least 30 days before the public hearing to be held by the planning and zoning commission. Written notices must indicate the nature of the proposed use or activity and the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing.
