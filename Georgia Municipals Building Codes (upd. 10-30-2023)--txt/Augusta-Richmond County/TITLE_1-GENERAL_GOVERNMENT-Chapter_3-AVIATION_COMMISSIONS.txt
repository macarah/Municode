In furtherance of this policy and in accordance with the authority conferred upon the Aviation Commission by the laws of the State of Georgia, the Aviation Commission shall establish and periodically adjust, as required, certain rates, fees, rentals, and other charges for the use and occupancy of airport facilities so that such rates, fees, rentals, and other charges are scheduled to recover from the airlines and nonairline owners or operators of aircraft, on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis, the fully allocated costs of the facilities and services used by such airlines and nonairline owners or operators of aircraft.

(i)
Calculation of terminal building rental rate. Each year, the Aviation Commission will recalculate the rental rate for space in the terminal building in the following manner:
a.
Terminal building rents are payable in accordance with Section 1-3-8.6. The Aviation Commission shall recalculate the terminal building rental rate for the succeeding fiscal year, by totaling the following estimated amounts, as set forth in the Aviation Commission's annual budget:
1.
The total of the direct and indirect operation and maintenance expenses allocable to the terminal building;
2.
An amount equal to one and one-fourth (1.25) times the pro rata portion of the annual debt service allocated to the terminal building net of available PFC proceeds authorized for the payment of a portion of terminal building annual debt service and coverage;
3.
The amount of deposits to any funds and accounts required by the Bond Resolution and allocable to the terminal building;
4.
Any other airport expense allocable to the terminal building not included in paragraphs 1 through 3 above; and
5.
An amount equal to any deficit or credit estimated for operation of the terminal building during the then-current fiscal year or any adjustment carried over from preceding fiscal years to reflect any difference between actual versus estimated expenses.
b.
The average rental rate shall then be calculated by dividing the terminal building costs computed above by the amount of rentable space square footage in the terminal building. The average rental rate shall then be multiplied by the total amount of square footage used or occupied by airline to determine the total annual terminal building space rent payable by each airline.
c.
The space rents for all joint use space shall be prorated among all airlines according to the joint use formula and each airline shall pay its pro rata share of such space rents.
d.
Terminal building rents are payable monthly in accordance with Section 1-3-8.6.

a.
The Aviation Commission shall calculate apron area fee for the succeeding fiscal year by totaling the following estimated amounts, as set forth in the annual budget:
1.
The total operation and maintenance expenses allocated to the apron area;
2.
An amount equal to one and one-fourth (1.25) times the pro rata portion of the annual debt service allocated to the apron area net of available passenger facility charge (hereinafter "PFC") proceeds authorized for the payment of a portion of apron area annual debt service and coverage;
3.
The amount of deposits to any funds and accounts required by the Bond Resolution and allocable to the apron area;
4.
Any other airport expense allocable to the apron area not included in paragraphs 1 through 3 above; and
5.
An amount equal to any deficit or credit estimated for operation of the apron area during the then-current fiscal year or any adjustment carried over from preceding fiscal years to reflect any difference between actual versus estimated expenses.
b.
The sum of the expenses identified in [subsections] 1 to 5 above equals the apron area requirement. The preferential apron area fee shall then be calculated by dividing the apron area requirement by the number of aircraft parking positions at the terminal building. An airline's preferential apron area fee shall then be calculated by multiplying the total number of aircraft parking positions assigned to and used by airline times the apron area rental rate per aircraft gate.
c.
The preferential apron area fee is payable monthly in accordance with section 1-3-8.6.
(iii)
Calculation of loading bridge use fee. The Aviation Commission shall calculate loading bridge use fees, to be effective upon date of beneficial occupancy (hereinafter "DBO") of the new terminal building, in the following manner:
a.
The Aviation Commission shall calculate the loading bridge use fee for the succeeding fiscal year by totaling the following estimated amounts as set forth in the annual budget:
1.
The total operation and maintenance expenses allocated to the loading bridges;
2.
An amount equal to one and one-fourth (1.25) times the pro rata portion of the annual debt service requirement net of passenger facility charge (hereinafter "PFC") proceeds, if any, authorized to pay debt service allocable to the loading bridges, or such other amount as may be required by the Bond Resolution;
3.
The amount of deposits to any funds and accounts required by the Bond Resolution and allocable to the loading bridge;

5.
An amount equal to any deficit or credit estimated for operation of the loading bridge during the then-current fiscal year or any adjustment carried over from preceding fiscal years to reflect any difference between actual versus estimated expenses.
b.
The loading bridge use fee rate per loading bridge shall be calculated by dividing the loading bridge use fee calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 5 above by the number of loading bridges. An airline's loading bridge use fee shall then be calculated by multiplying the loading bridge use fee rate per loading bridge by the number of loading bridges assigned to airline.
c.
The loading bridge use fee is payable monthly in accordance with Section 1-3-8.6.
(iv)
Calculation of landing fee rate.
a.
Each fiscal year, the Aviation Commission shall recalculate the landing fee rate for the fiscal year commencing January 1, and for each succeeding fiscal year, based upon the Aviation Commission's proposed annual budget for the succeeding fiscal year by totaling the following estimated amounts:
1.
The total of the direct and indirect estimated operation and maintenance expenses of the airfield area;
2.
An amount equal to the airfield area annual debt service (plus coverage), to pay debt service allocable to the airfield area, or such other amount as may be required by the Bond Resolution;

Any overpayment or underpayment estimated for operation of the airfield area during the then-current fiscal year, or any adjustment carried over from the preceding fiscal year, to reflect any difference between actual versus estimated revenues or expenses; and
6.
Any other airfield area expense not included in paragraphs 1 to 5 above.
b.
The airfield area requirement for the succeeding fiscal year shall be calculated by subtracting from total airport expense [the total of [subsections] 1 to 5 above] a competitive credit in an amount determined appropriate by the Aviation Commission each fiscal year. The purpose of the competitive credit is to keep the airline's airport cost per enplane passenger competitive with other airports similarly situated for air service development purposes. The Aviation Commission may establish differing levels of competitive credit for different classes of airlines.
c.
The landing fee rate for the succeeding fiscal year shall be calculated by dividing the net airfield area requirement computed above by the estimated total landed weight of all aircraft Arrivals at the airport for the succeeding fiscal year as estimated by the Aviation Commission.
d.
The landing fee shall be calculated by multiplying the airline's portion of total landed weight for the month by the landing fee rate then in effect.
e.
The landing fee is payable monthly in accordance with Section 1-3-8.6.
( Ord. No. 7031 , § 1, 2-5-2008)
Sec. 1-3-8.8. - Extraordinary adjustments of rents and fees.
