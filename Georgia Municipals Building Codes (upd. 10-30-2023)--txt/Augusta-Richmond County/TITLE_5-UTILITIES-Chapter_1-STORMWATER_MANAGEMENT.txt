Chapter 1 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 5-1-1. - Generally.
This Chapter shall be known as the Storm Water Management Ordinance of Augusta, Georgia.
( Ord. No. 7291 , § 5-1-1, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7498 , exh. A(5-1-1), 7-28-2015)
Sec. 5-1-2. - Findings.
(a)
Authority to collect, treat, and manage storm water is found in Art IX, Sec. II, Par. 3 of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, and more expressly at O.C.G.A. § 36-82-61, wherein this local government is given the power to own, operate and maintain systems, works, instrumentalities, and facilities used or useful in connection with the collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of storm water.
(b)
Uncontrolled storm water drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Augusta, Georgia. Surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters.
(c)
Uncontrolled storm water drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(d)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(e)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(f)
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.; the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20, et seq., and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto place increase emphasis on the role of local government in developing, implementing conducting, and funding storm water management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff.
(g)
Many future problems can be avoided through property storm water management.
(h)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of Augusta, Georgia storm water system.
(i)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm water system. The continued economic development depends upon effective solutions to the existing and continuing storm water problems and preservation of the quality of waters in the lakes, streams, and rivers.
( Ord. No. 7291 , § 5-1-2, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7498 , exh. A(5-1-2), 7-28-2015)
Sec. 5-1-3. - Objective.
