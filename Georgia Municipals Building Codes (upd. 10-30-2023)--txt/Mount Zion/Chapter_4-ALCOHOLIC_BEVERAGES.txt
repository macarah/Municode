ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Purpose and authority to regulate alcoholic beverages in city.
(a)
This chapter has been enacted in furtherance of the police powers of the city and in accordance with a plan designed for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health and general welfare of the community by establishing reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages. It is intended to protect and preserve schools and places of worship; to give effect to existing land use and to preserve residential areas, with reasonable considerations, among others, to the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses; to minimize congestion in the roads and streets; to promote economic and development activity within those areas of the city having the road structure and sewerage capacity to handle additional and larger concentrations of lodging and dining facilities; and with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining stability of neighborhood and property values, it is intended to protect against the evils of concentration of ownership or control of the retail outlets for alcoholic beverages and to prevent persons of ill repute from controlling the retail alcoholic beverage industry within the boundaries of the city.
(b)
The provisions of this chapter are ordained under and by virtue of the authority granted by the laws of the state, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-1 et seq., Regulation of Alcoholic Beverages Generally. To adopt all reasonable rules and regulations as may fall within the police powers of the municipality to regulate and impose taxes on any such business; O.C.G.A. § 3-4-110, granting each municipality the full power to adopt all reasonable rules and regulations governing the location and conduct of any such licensee, including, but not limited to, the regulation of hours of business, types of employees, and other matters which may fall within the police powers of such municipality; O.C.G.A. §§ 3-5-40 and 3-5-42, authorizing municipal licenses for the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling malt beverages at wholesale and retail; O.C.G.A. § 3-6-40, authorizing municipal licenses for the manufacturing, distributing and selling of wine at wholesale and retail; O.C.G.A. § 3-11-3, authorizing sales off-premises for catered functions by licensed caterers; O.C.G.A. § 3-9-3, authorizing issuance of temporary permits for sale by nonprofit civic organizations of alcoholic beverages for consumption only on-premises; O.C.G.A. §§ 3-9-10 and 3-9-11, authorizing licensing and regulation of in-room service of alcoholic beverages by licensed hotels and motels.
(c)
The provisions of this chapter regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises are ordained by virtue of the authority granted by the constitution and laws of the United States and state, as most recently delineated by the supreme court of the state in its decisions of Gravely vs. Bacon, and S.J.T., Inc. vs. Richmond County, in order to avoid the effects of criminal interests and negative effects on the community by the decreased safety and welfare of the city's citizens, the hindering of commercial growth in the city, and the deterioration of the city's economic base.

(a)
Any license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the city may be suspended or revoked for due cause as hereinafter defined. Due cause, for purposes of this section, shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)
Arrest or conviction (to include a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) by local, state or federal authorities of the licensee, a license representative, or any employee of the licensee (as to an "employee," for an act taking place while on duty at the licensed facility or in conjunction with the employee's employment), for any felony, or any misdemeanor of a crime opposed to decency and morality, or any law, regulation or ordinance involving beverage alcohol, gambling, or tax law violations;
(2)
Citations issued by local, state or federal authorities to the licensee, license representative or any employees of the licensee for violations of any part of this chapter or any regulation pertaining to state or federal licensing of the possession, sale or distribution of beverage alcohol;
(3)
Suspension or revocation of any state license required as condition for the possession, sale or distribution of beverage alcohol;
(4)
Material falsification of any fact given in application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor; any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented;
(5)
The licensed business fails to properly account for, file, report and maintain any records or remit or pay any renewal license fee imposed, sales taxes, or excise taxes required under the city ordinances;
(6)
Any other factors known to the licensing authority whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, by reason of business experience, financial standing, trade association, personal association, record of arrests, or reputation in any community in which he has resided, is not likely to maintain the operation for which he is licensed in conformity with federal, state or local laws.
With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aide in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(b)
Action to suspend or revoke a license, other than a temporary or emergency suspension, shall be commenced by the city clerk making written recommendation to the city council, and giving written notice to the licensee, either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service upon the licensee or his agent at the licensed location, stating the grounds therefor, and the date, time and place such matter will be heard by the city council. Notice shall be served at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Included in the notice shall be an advisement of the licensee's right to be heard before the council. Any licensee requiring subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or documents at the hearing shall file a written request with the city clerk at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued for good cause only.
(c)
All final decisions to suspend or revoke a license shall be made by the city council, in writing, with the reasons therefor stated. Notice of a final decision shall be given to the licensee within seven full business days after the hearing. Failure to notify the licensee shall not result in an automatic approval for the continued operation of the licensed premises or the continued good standing of the license, but shall require a new hearing on the matter by the city council, after proper notice is once again given in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
(d)
Hearings to suspend or revoke a license shall only be as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney or his designee shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. The licensee may be represented by legal counsel, may confront and cross examine witnesses, and shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence in his behalf. A hearing record shall be maintained by the city; however, either party may arrange for transcription by a court reporter at his sole expense. Hearings shall be presided over by the mayor who shall preserve order and rule upon all matter of evidence. Irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
(e)
Upon the second suspension or revocation of a license within any five-year period, as a prerequisite or reinstatement or reissuance of the license, the licensee, in addition to the requisite fees assessed under this chapter, shall post a surety bond, payable to the city, in the amount of $5,000.00, conditioned upon the licensee maintaining the operation for which he is licensed in conformity with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Upon any subsequent act giving due cause for suspension or revocation of the license, the bond shall be forfeited and the license revoked.
