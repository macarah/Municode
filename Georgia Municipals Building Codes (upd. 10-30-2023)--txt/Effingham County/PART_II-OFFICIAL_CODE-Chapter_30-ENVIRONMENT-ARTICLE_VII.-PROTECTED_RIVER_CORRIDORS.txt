ARTICLE VII. - PROTECTED RIVER CORRIDORS

Sec. 30-250. - Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as a "Protected River Corridors Ordinance."
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-251. - Purpose.
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. The Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers have been designated as protected rivers by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the protected rivers as defined herein. The river corridor regulations established in this article require the maintenance of buffers where natural vegetation is left intact along the banks of protected rivers. Preservation of the soil and plants within the corridor reduces non-point source pollution entering the rivers and minimizes riverbank erosion. The vegetation acts to slow down water flow and trap sediment and other contaminants carried in runoff before they reach downstream water supplies. This article also minimizes disturbance of the natural terrain and vegetation and protects water quality through various use limitations.

Sec. 30-252. - Definitions.
[The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:]
Hazardous waste: Any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
Land disturbing activity: Any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area: A river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river: A river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Port facility: Any facility for the docking, loading, and unloading of ships.
Protected river: Any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by the appropriate U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle map (the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic map prepared at a scale of 1:24,000). However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limit of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act. The DNR has determined for administrative purposes that the line dividing protected coastal marshlands and protected river corridors is along the route of U.S. Highway 17.
Public utility or utilities: A service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
Riverbank: The rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. Riverbanks are usually marked by a break in slope.
River corridor: All the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. ยง 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. ยง 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of a protected river as measured from the riverbanks. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time.
Sensitive natural area: Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the DNR, which contains one or more of the following: habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; rare or exemplary natural communities; significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or other areas so designated by the DNR; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Single-family dwelling: A dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family or household.

Sec. 30-253. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all protected rivers, as defined by this article, and to all river corridors, as defined by this article. The regulations in this article shall not supersede those contained in the Metropolitan River Protection Act, the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, and the Erosion and Sedimentation Act.

Sec. 30-254. - Protected river corridor buffer required.
Along any protected river, as defined by this article, the river corridor, as defined by this article shall be maintained as a natural vegetative buffer or buffer area as defined by this article, except as specifically otherwise exempted or provided for in this article.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-255. - Measurement of required buffer.
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbanks. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be considered as within the 100-foot buffer required by this article and shall be afforded the same protection as the 100-foot buffer.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-256. - Land disturbing activity within required buffer.
