ARTICLE IV. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS

Sec. 30-200. - Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Water Supply Watersheds Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-201. - Purpose and intent.
The quality of public drinking water supplies must be assured. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation, which threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs and impair the quality of public drinking water supplies. Stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediments into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive, and rendering water resources unusable for recreation and other uses. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in potential risks of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. Therefore, land use activities within water supply watersheds must be regulated to ensure that public water supplies remain clean. This article establishes standards consistent with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds (Rule 391-3-16-01) to ensure water quality in the watershed system is not compromised by land activities such as grading, septic systems, and accidental release of contaminants. The intent of this article is to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds, and to ensure water can be treated to meet federal and state drinking water standards.

Sec. 30-202. - Definitions.
[The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:]
Buffer: A natural or enhanced vegetated area with no land disturbances except as may be specifically permitted within a buffer, located adjacent to water supply reservoirs or perennial streams within water supply watersheds.
Corridor: All land within the buffer areas established adjacent to water supply reservoirs or perennial streams within water supply watersheds and within other setback areas specified in this article.
Impervious surface: A manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, and patios.
Large water supply watershed: A watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Perennial stream: A stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated by a solid blue line on a United States Geological Survey Quadrangle map.
Reservoir boundary: The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.
Small water supply watershed: A watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Utility: Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Watershed protection map: A map prepared for the local jurisdiction which identifies water supply watersheds and water supply reservoirs, which are the subject of this article. The watershed protection map also identifies public water supply intake points and perennial streams within the watershed that are upstream of water supply intake points or water supply reservoirs, and the seven-mile radius line from each water intake or water supply reservoir boundary.
Water supply reservoir: A governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Water supply watershed: The area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.

The watershed protection map, as defined by this article, is hereby adopted and made a part of this article as if fully set forth herein.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-204. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all lands within existing and future small water supply watersheds, large water supply watersheds, and to water supply reservoirs and their immediate surroundings, as shown on the watershed protection map. This article does not apply to watersheds not used for public drinking water supply.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-205. - Exemptions.
The following land uses and activities are exempted from compliance with this article.
(1)
Land uses existing prior to the adoption of this article.
(2)
Mining activities permitted by the department of natural resources under the Surface Mining Act.
(3)
If utilities cannot feasibly be located outside the buffer or setback areas required by this article, such utility locations can be exempted from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions subject to the following conditions:
a.
The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible;
b.
The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible; and,
c.
The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
(4)
Specific forestry and agricultural activities in the stream corridor buffer and setback areas in accordance with the following conditions.
a.
The activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission or the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and,
b.
The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.

Sec. 30-206. - Hazardous materials handling facilities.
New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, and which will locate in a small water supply watershed or within seven miles upstream of a water supply intake or a water supply reservoir of a large water supply watershed, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and the requirements of any adopted or applicable Fire Prevention Code.
