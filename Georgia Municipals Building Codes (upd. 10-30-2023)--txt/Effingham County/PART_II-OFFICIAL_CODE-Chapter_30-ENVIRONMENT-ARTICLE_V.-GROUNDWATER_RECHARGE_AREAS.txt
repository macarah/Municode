ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS

Sec. 30-220. - Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as an "Ordinance to Protect Groundwater Recharge Areas."
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-221. - Purpose and intent.
Groundwater is among the Nation's most important natural resources. It provides drinking water to urban and rural communities, supports irrigation and industry, sustains the flow of streams and rivers, and maintains riparian and wetland ecosystems. In many areas of the Nation, the future sustainability of groundwater resources is at risk from overuse and contamination. Because groundwater systems typically respond slowly to human actions, a long-term perspective is needed to manage this valuable resource. This article is intended to implement rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division known as the "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria" as they specifically relate to groundwater recharge areas (Rule 391-3-16-.02). It is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the public that the quality of subsurface public drinking water be maintained. Groundwater resources exist in underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface that are capable of providing water for a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface, known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when development occurs within groundwater recharge areas. Certain land use activities, such as septic tanks, underground tanks, and chemical spills, pose a significant threat to the quality of groundwater supplies. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land uses within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats and development impacts are minimized. To this end, this article establishes minimum lot sizes to provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management systems.

Sec. 30-222. - Definitions.
[The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:]
Acre-foot: The volume (as of irrigation water) that would cover one acre to a depth of one foot.
Aquifer: Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or providing water for a well.
DRASTIC: The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Hydrologic Atlas 18: A map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and published by the Georgia Geologic Survey in 1989, which identifies the most significant groundwater recharge areas of Georgia as spotted areas labeled as "areas of thick soils."
Hydrologic Atlas 20: A multicolored map of Georgia at a scale of 1:500,000, prepared by the Georgia DNR using the DRASTIC methodology and published by the Georgia Geologic Survey in 1992, which shows areas of high, average (or medium), and low susceptibility of groundwater to pollution in Georgia. This map is also commonly known as the Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.
Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. Each significant recharge area shown on Hydrologic Atlas 18 is classified on Hydrologic Atlas 20 as high, medium, or low, and these classifications are relevant in this article.
Recharge area: Any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant Recharge Areas: Those areas mapped by the Georgia DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition) within the unincorporated county. Each significant recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on Hydrologic Atlas 20.

Hydrologic Atlas 18, as defined by this article is hereby adopted and made a part of this article as if fully set forth herein.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-224. - Adoption of Hydrologic Atlas 20 by reference.
Hydrologic Atlas 20, as defined by this article is hereby adopted and made a part of this article as if fully set forth herein.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-225. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all lands within the unincorporated county that are mapped as significant recharge areas as defined by this article.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-226. - Permit required.
No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the building official for a building, structure, or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank, unless the land use or building conforms to the requirements of this article. Prior to a land use permit or building permit being issued, the building official shall require a site plan or subdivision plat in sufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-227. - County health department approval of permit required.
No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the building official for a building, structure, or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank, unless the Effingham County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter DHR Manual) and this article.
(Ord. of 11-6-12)
Sec. 30-228. - Minimum lot size.
Within an area governed by this article, new homes or land uses served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum lot sizes as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in DHR Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors set forth in Sections A-F of the DHR Manual, as determined by the Effingham County Health Department.
(1)
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area.
(2)
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within an average or medium pollution susceptibility area.
