This article shall be known as the "2017 Ordinance for an Ad Valorem Tax Increase on Hiawassee Derelict and Blighted Property."
(Ord. of 2-7-2017, § 1)
Sec. 32-20. - Purpose.
(a)
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
(b)
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and city council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations by the Urban Redevelopment Law, O.C.G.A. § 36-61-1 et seq., has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
(c)
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII (d) of the 1983 constitution of the state.

b.
The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition.

At the time of registration, the operator shall indicate that he is permitted to make annual or quarterly sales tax returns together with month and day said returns are due. The failure of the operator to indicate that he is permitted under applicable state statute to file quarterly reports will infer that monthly reports are due and collectable. Operators that make annual filings to the state that file quarterly with the city shall file on January 20, April 20, June 20 and/or September 20.
(c)
At the time any such report is due, the operator shall file a copy of the corresponding state sales tax return for the sole purpose of verifying the sums reported and due.
