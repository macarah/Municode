Sec. 26-53. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control.
(a)
General provisions.
(1)
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sediment control measures and practices that shall be incorporated into erosion and sediment control plans that conform to the requirements of this article.
(2)
The application of such measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
(b)
Best management practices.
(1)
Required. Best management practices, as set forth in this subsection, shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.
(2)
Defense to enforcement action. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the EPD director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a land development permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act.
(3)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Proper design and properly designed mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(4)
Violations. A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the state environmental protection division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the EPD director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the environmental protection division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
(5)
Requirements by EPD director. The EPD director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board of natural resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(c)
Minimum requirements. Land-disturbing activities shall, as a minimum, require protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practical;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills;
(11)

(15)
Except as otherwise provided in this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the EPD director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the EPD director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for waterlines; or
2.

The EPD director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for waterlines; or

Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by the number of copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans specified by the land use officer. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to the creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board of natural resources.
(c)
A fee, in the amount established by the city council from time to time, shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, in the project area.
(d)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the state environmental protection division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the state environmental protection division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(e)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by this article, and bonding, if required pursuant to this article, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
(f)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(g)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. In particular, the land use officer shall require a bond for habitual violators (defined as three or more convictions in the previous year) and may require such a bond for persons who have violated soil erosion regulations one or more times in the last three years. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-5; Ord. No. 2021-05-01 , § 1, 7-6-2021)
Sec. 26-92. - Exemptions from plat approval.
The following types of land subdivisions, transfers, and sales are specifically exempted from the plat approval requirements of this article; provided, however, that such exemptions shall not apply to land development requirements and improvement requirements of this article:
(1)
The creation and sale of cemetery plots.
(2)
The sale of lots consistent with previously approved and recorded plats or deeds.
(3)
The creation of leaseholds for space within a multiple-occupancy building or the division of property into leaseholds for commercial, industrial, or institutional use.
(4)
The creation of leaseholds for the agricultural use of property where the use does not involve the construction of a building to be used as a residence or for other purposes not directly related to agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon.
(5)
Any division of land to heirs through a judicial estate proceeding, or any division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that such exemption shall not require the city to issue permits if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction concerning lot size, lot width, and other dimensional requirements.
(6)
Intra-family land transfers and mortgage lots, as defined by this article.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-6)
Sec. 26-93. - Lot combinations.
An existing lot line forming the boundary between two conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged to form one building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the requirements of this article. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the land use officer and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots (see graphic below).
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-7)
Sec. 26-94. - Boundary line adjustments.
One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the land use officer and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the land use officer and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots (see graphic below).
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-8)
Sec. 26-95. - Design requirements for blocks.
(a)
Block length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. The planning committee may require pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block be located near the center in blocks longer than 800 feet.
(b)
Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries (see graphic below).
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-9)
Sec. 26-96. - Design requirements for lots.
(a)
Natural features and assets. In the subdividing of land, appropriate consideration must be given to all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness to the proposed development and safety from hazards.
(b)
Access and minimum lot frontage. Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum of 60 feet of lot frontage on a public street; provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by private streets, as more fully specified in this article; provided further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet.
(c)
Adequate buildable area required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body (see graphic below).
(d)
Lot remnants not permitted. All remnants of lots, below any required minimum lot size that may be required left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The land use officer may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific nonbuilding use.
(e)
Service areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended.
(f)
Lot area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, or any other such ordinance provisions, if applicable.
(g)
Lot width. No portion of a lot shall be narrower than 60 feet, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots at the street frontage, nor shall any lot have a lot width less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, if applicable.
(h)
Lot depth. Lots shall have a depth of not less than 100 feet, unless circumstances make these limitations impracticable.
(i)
Flag lots.
(1)
Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this article, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be approved where conditions of hardship make standard design or frontage impossible or impractical due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided.
(2)
Denial if reasonable alternative exists. The land use officer, in the case of minor subdivisions, and the planning committee, in the case of other subdivisions, shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes any flag lot, when a reasonable alternative to such lot pattern is available.
(3)
Panhandle (flagpole) length restriction. If permitted, no flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a panhandle portion (i.e., a portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than 400 feet in length.
(4)
Prohibition of abutting flag lots. If permitted, no flag lot shall abut another flag lot in any subdivision.
(j)
Side lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
(k)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements, if applicable, from all rights-of-way.
(l)
Double frontage lots. Double frontage or through lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial street.
(m)
Mortgage lot. This provision addresses situations where a bank requires the creation of small (i.e., one-acre to five-acre) tracts of property from a larger existing parcel (usually farmland or timberland) in order to provide a mortgage or loan on a home or other principal building, rather than referring to the entire existing lot of record.
(1)
In cases where a person can show the land use officer in writing that an application for loan or mortgage involving real property has been filed with a bank or lending institution, and said bank or lending institution requires, for purposes of the loan or mortgage, a description of property that encompasses less land area than the lot of record, one or two mortgage lots (see definition) may be lawfully created from the parcel of record without constituting a subdivision. Minimum lot sizes established by any land use district or other ordinance requirement of the city shall not be construed to prevent the creation of mortgage lots pursuant to this subsection, even if the resulting mortgage lot created is less than the minimum lot size required by said land use district or other ordinance requirement. The applicant shall be required, in the case of a mortgage lot, to file with the land use officer a copy of the survey plat creating the mortgage lot, and may be recorded in the records of the county superior court clerk as a mortgage lot plat of record.
(2)
If created, a mortgage lot shall be no less than one acre and no larger than five acres in size. This provision shall not allow for the creation of a mortgage lot from any lot of record that is five acres or less in area.
(3)
No mortgage lot shall be created unless it has a minimum 30-foot wide access easement from a road abutting the property frontage of the larger lot of record to the boundary of the mortgage lot.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-10)
Sec. 26-97. - Easements.
Where a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of adequate width. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the land use officer. Where easements are needed for utility locations, the subdivider shall provide them to the appropriate utility provider. Where easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as determined appropriate by the land use officer. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat, if required, and final plat.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-11)
Sec. 26-98. - Survey monuments for all lots required.
For all subdivisions, a state-registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of section 180-7-.05, monument, of the rules of the state board of registration for professional engineers and land surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act, O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-12)
Sec. 26-99. - Preliminary plat.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a preliminary plat of all major subdivisions for review and approval by the planning committee.
(b)
When required. All major subdivisions, as defined, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat to the land use officer for review and approval by the planning committee. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance or development, or the installation of any improvements, the planning committee must approve the preliminary plat, if required.
(c)
Preliminary plat application and specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 4-2.
(d)
Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the land use officer shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the planning committee and forward all pertinent materials in the application to the planning committee for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted as least 14 days before the regular meeting date of the planning committee to be considered on that agenda. The planning committee shall have 32 days from the date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the planning committee's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this article, and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development.
(e)
Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, after which time, a complete construction plans application must be submitted. If a completed application for construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void.
(f)
Amendments to approved preliminary plats. The land use officer is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. Any proposed amendment to a preliminary plat that is determined by the land use officer to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major amendments, planning committee approval shall be required. The planning committee shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-13)
Sec. 26-100. - Construction plans and development permit.
(a)
Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, or if no preliminary plat is required, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan approval and approval of a development permit. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land development, the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application conference with the land use officer to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of this article and other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval and development permitting process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval and development permit shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing, nor development permit approved by the land use officer until a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the planning committee and the proposed construction plans are found by the land use officer to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval.
(b)
Decision criteria. The only basis upon which the land use officer may deny a construction plan or development permit is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this article or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the planning committee.
(c)
Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plan noting such approval by the land use officer. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the land use officer approves an extension of time.
(d)
Engineered drawings. Engineering drawings for public streets, including cros-sections and centerline profiles, and public and private water, sewer, drainage, and utility systems, certified by a professional engineer registered in the state, or, if authorized under state law, a registered land surveyor or professional landscape architect shall be required to be submitted for review and approval, and such plans must meet the requirements of this article and the specifications of the land use officer. Prior to approval and recording of a final plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, if required, a registered engineer for the subdivider/developer shall submit one copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements, demonstrating that said improvements, as installed, meet the requirements of this article and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The land use officer shall maintain all as-built street and utility plans for future use by the city.
(e)
Permits for construction in public right-of-way. Permits from the land use officer shall be required for construction in any public right-of-way. Permits will not be issued until such time that plans have been submitted and approved by the land use officer.
(f)
Improvements to abutting land. For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install curb and gutter, sidewalk, other road improvements, and, if required, a deceleration lane, according to the standards and specifications of this article and the land use officer, along all abutting public streets. When a subdivision or land development uses an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement width consistent with city road design standards. Said improvements shall be from the subdivision or land development entrance to the paved city road which the land use officer determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or occupants of the land development.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-14)

An escrow of funds with the city;
(2)
An escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the city can draw;
(3)
An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the city can draw;
(4)
A performance bond for the benefit of the city upon which the city can collect, or a certificate of deposit with assignment letter; and
(5)
Any other form of guarantee approved by the mayor and city council that will satisfy the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as determined by the city, of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-17)
Sec. 26-104. - Limitations on minor subdivisions.
(a)
Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the same landowner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than four lots. It is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process.
(b)
Common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this article, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision.
(c)
Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this article. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years, regardless of ownership.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-18)
Sec. 26-105. - Standards for configuring new streets.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The entire community enjoys the benefits of an interconnected network of streets and roads. It is the intention of the locality that new street alignments in new developments reflect the traditional style exhibited throughout older, established neighborhoods. Interconnected streets afford easier, safer access for emergency vehicles, school buses, and sanitation trucks while distributing traffic more evenly and avoiding excess traffic on certain central residential streets. Street patterns that result in isolated pockets of development with relatively little interconnectivity are strongly discouraged. Wherever cul-de-sacs or hammerhead turnarounds are unavoidable (typically for topographic reasons), they must always be provided with bicycle or pedestrian linkages to other nearby streets or to a neighborhood trail system. Wherever possible, cul-de-sacs should be designed to include a central island preserving existing greenery or, alternatively, planted with approved trees, shrubs, and plants.
(b)
Street alignment, intersections and jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 150 feet in urban areas and 300 feet in rural areas (see graphic below).
(c)
Continuation of existing streets and connections. Existing streets and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The planning committee may require that a major subdivision provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts.
(d)
Street plans for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration may be required by the land use officer and, if required, shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer.
(e)
Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Streets that dead-end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of such streets shall be 600 feet. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary cul-de-sac as required by the land use officer.
(f)
Marginal access streets. Whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required by the planning committee at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway right-of-way. The planning committee may also require a 20-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto (see graphic below).
(g)
Alleys and service access. Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must be paved. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided were possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities. Service access shall be provided to commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-19)
Sec. 26-106. - Requirements for streets.
(a)
Bridges. Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards.
(b)
Grading and stabilization of street rights-of-ways. When a new public street is proposed, all trees, brush, stumps, rocks, or other debris shall be cleared from the street right-of-way, except in cases where trees are required to be preserved by the land use officer. All streets shall be graded to lines, grades and cross-sections approved on plans. All unsurfaced, disturbed portions of street rights-of-way shall be stabilized by seeding, fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method.
(c)
Radius at street intersections. The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall be a minimum of 15 feet, with larger radii for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the land use officer. The minimum pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be 25 feet.
(d)
Street grades. No street grade shall be less than one percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector street shall exceed eight percent. No other local street grade shall exceed 12 percent, unless the land use officer finds that due to topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which case the street grade shall not exceed 15 percent. Grades between 12 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet.
(e)
Minimum street right-of-way and pavement widths. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall, at minimum, meet the following:
EXPAND
Street Type Minimum Right-Of-Way Width (Feet) Minimum Pavement Width (Feet)
Major arterial street Per thoroughfare plan Per thoroughfare plan
Collector street 60 36
Local street with curb and gutter 50 24 (back-of-curb to back-of-curb)
Local street without curb and gutter 60 24
Cul-de-sac turnaround radius 50 40 (back-of-curb)
Alley 20 16
  (f)
Street horizontal alignment and reverse curves. Street horizontal alignments and reverse curves shall, at minimum, meet the following:
EXPAND
Street Type Minimum Horizontal Radii Of Center Line Curvature (Feet) Minimum Tangents Between Reverse Curves (Feet)

Sec. 26-107. - Curbcuts and access specifications.
(a)
Entrance improvement specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lanes and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the land use officer, in accordance with applicable state or city specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the land use officer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any city street shall be approved by the land use officer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits.
(b)
Curbcut specifications. No curbcut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway. Curbcuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back-of-curb to back-of-curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the land use officer. The land use officer may limit the maximum width of a curbcut and/or the number of curbcuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.
(c)
Access along and near divided highways. Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met:
EXPAND
Minimum Access Separation Requirements Distance (Feet)
Curbcut of driveway from street intersection with divided highway 600
Parallel frontage road from right-of-way of divided highway 450
Curbcut or driveway on a local road from right-of-way of divided highway 200
Curbcut or driveway on a local road from state highway 200
Curbcut or driveway on parallel frontage road from local road 150
  (d)
Interparcel connections. New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on-site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-21)
Sec. 26-108. - Street lighting.
(a)
Street lights may be provided in accordance with city specifications by the developers of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the city and by the utility company that will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than 30 feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the land use officer. Fixtures shall be located no more than 500 feet apart, unless approved by the land use officer and, when provided, at least one light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development.
(b)
The developer shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights, as well as arrange an agreement with the utility company for complete maintenance of all installations. The city may assume the responsibility and make the monthly payments to the power company for electrical energy for each street light only after these requirements have been accomplished and improvements accepted by the local governing body. Maintenance and operation costs of streetlights will be assumed by the city no earlier than two years after lights have been installed.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-22)
Sec. 26-109. - Street signs.
(a)
Signs for street names, directions of travel, traffic control, and hazards shall be provided as directed by the land use officer. Street signs on exterior/boundary streets shall be installed by the city with the developer paying a proportionate share determined by the city. Street signs for interior streets of a subdivision or land development shall be installed at the subdivider or developer's expense by the subdivider or developer, subject to the approval of the land use officer.
(b)
Unless otherwise provided in standards and specifications adopted by the city, street signs shall meet the following specifications: Signs shall be constructed of aluminum sheets with reflective backgrounds. Information on the street name signs shall be readable from both sides of the sign. Signs shall be installed on a steel post. The vertical distance from the road elevation to the bottom of the sign face shall be seven feet with a minimum burial depth of three feet.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-23)
Sec. 26-110. - Curbs and gutters.
(a)
Curbs and gutters shall be installed, if required by the land use officer, in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. Subdivisions consisting totally of lots intended for single-family residential use containing a minimum of two acres shall not require curbs and gutters; provided, however, that curbs are required for all roads when sidewalks are required by this article. All commercial and industrial subdivisions and land developments must have curbs and gutters, regardless of the size of the lots. When property fronting on an existing city street is subdivided or developed, and the subdivision or land development uses said existing street for access, then curb and gutter shall be required along said street along the entire property frontage of said street.
(b)
Curbs shall be concrete which shall be class A 3,000-psi strength at 28 days. The typical curb minimum section shall be six inches by 24 inches by 12 inches (see graphic below).
(c)
All streets and roads not required to include curbs and gutters shall be graded, paved, and drained to meet all construction and drainage standards for ditches, slopes, and grassing according to specifications established by the city.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-24)
Sec. 26-111. - Sidewalks.
(a)
When required. Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with this article, unless the land use officer determines that no public need exists for sidewalks in a certain location. Sidewalks shall be required when land developments and subdivisions are located within one-half mile of a public school, hospital, city park, city square or city recreational facility. Sidewalks are required to be installed along one side of the street internal to a major subdivision, except in cases where the median lot size of the major subdivision is two acres or more.
(b)
Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-of-way of roads and shall parallel the street pavement as much as possible; provided, however, the land use officer may permit sidewalks to be designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent obstructions or deviate from a linear pattern for design purposes.
(c)
Specifications. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs in residential areas. All sidewalks shall be construction in accordance with the state department of transportation specifications for enhancement grants that include sidewalk construction.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-25)
Sec. 26-112. - Private streets.
(a)
Private streets permitted. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the mayor and city council within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the mayor and city council at the time of preliminary plat approval by the planning committee. Following a recommendation by the planning committee to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the mayor and city council shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section.
(b)
Construction plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of construction plans from the land use officer and a development permit issued in accordance with the requirements of this article.
(c)
Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by this article for public streets, applicable construction specifications of the city, and as approved by the land use officer.
(d)
Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the land use officer and county 911 center. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private." The sign signifying the private street may be required by the city to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field.
(e)
Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall, at minimum, be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan and the city for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either:
(1)
Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or
(2)
Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners' association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot).
(f)
Maintenance. The city shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for noncompliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms:
(1)
The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision of seven or more lots fronting on a private street.
(2)
The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule.
(3)
The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street.
(4)
The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street.
(5)
The covenant shall run with the land.
(6)
The mayor and city council may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners association, or the council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the land use officer into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise.
(g)
Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The land use officer shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat:
(1)
Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section:
"Public Notice: The City of Hiawassee has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat."
(2)
Grant of easement.
"The general purpose public access and utility easement shown on this plat for private street is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the city, and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, waterlines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines.
___________
Signature of Property Owner;" and
(3)
The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the mayor and city council waives the dedication requirement:
"Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement shown on this plat for private street shall be dedicated to the City of Hiawassee by Council Acceptance and Approval at Public Meeting and as recorded on the Public Record.
___________
Signature of Property Owner."
(h)
Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the city, the owner, subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot:
"Purchaser's Acknowledgement of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility:
(I)/(We) have read the Declaration of covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction ___________ (insert address or attach legal description). (I)/(We) understand that the Declaration of covenant applies to the lot that (I am)/(we are) purchasing and requires (me)/(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the construction and maintenance of any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)/(we are) purchasing, and that owners of other lots in this plat may sue for and recover those costs which this covenant requires (me)/(us) to pay, plus their damages resulting from (my)/(our) refusal to contribute, plus reasonable attorneys' fees. (I)/(We) further understand that the City has no obligation to assist with the maintenance and improvement of the private street, drainage facilities, and other appurtenances within the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private road serving the lot in question.

General requirements. An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments within the city. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The city may require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The planning committee shall not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for stormwater and floodwater runoff channels or basins as determined by the land use officer. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or development permit issued for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and stormwater management.
(b)
Method of design and capacity. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as approved by the city, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a ten-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catchbasins, inlets, cross-drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works.
(c)
Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. Catchbasins shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road.
(d)
Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Stormwater shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body.
(e)
Grading and site drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials.
(f)
Cross-drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by the city. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross-drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than one percent.
(g)
Drop inlets. Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless otherwise specified by the city.
(h)
Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainageway crosses a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the city. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least 20 feet shall be provided.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-27)
Sec. 26-114. - Water.
(a)
Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply.
(b)
Water main requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to specifications of the city. All water mains shall normally be at least six inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters Association. Pipe of less than four inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Waterlines shall be installed at least 30 inches below grade. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise specifically provided.
(c)
Wells. If a county and/or municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. In subdivisions or land developments with a residential density of one unit per acre or less and when a public water system is not available as determined by the city, individual wells may be used in a manner so that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision or to the land development. When individual wells are proposed to be used for water supply, water samples shall be submitted to the county health department for its approval, and individual wells shall be approved by the county health department. Approvals shall be submitted to the land use officer prior to final subdivision plat approval.
(d)
Community water system. If the municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. Any community water system, if permitted, shall provide a minimum flow of 400 gallons per day per each lot platted, whether or not each lot is to be immediately developed; shall be sanitary; and shall have a minimum pressure of 30 pounds per square inch at each lot in the subdivision or each land development to be served. For all common non-public water supply systems, acceptable management, maintenance, and distribution policies and procedures shall be established. These policies and procedures shall be required to guarantee the provision of adequate supplies to each perspective lot owner on a continuing, ongoing basis, and to provide acceptable means for repairs and unforeseen events. The community water system plan shall be approved by the county health department and a letter of approval from the state department of natural resources shall accompany the final plat or land development application. Notwithstanding, any provision of this article to the contrary, the community water system shall meet the requirements of all applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation.
(e)
Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all subdivisions except those permitted to be served by individual on-site wells. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the city and the county fire department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the fire department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities.
(Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-28)
Sec. 26-115. - Sewer.
(a)
Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots within the city shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment.
(b)
Connection to public sewerage system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, as determined by the city, the subdivider or land developer shall connect with it and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. If a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, it shall be unlawful for any person to maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is not immediately accessible but is anticipated by the city to be available within a period of three years, the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision or land development boundary so that a future connection with the public sewer main can be made. The land use officer may condition the approval of a subdivision or land development on the agreement to connect to the public sewerage system upon its availability. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two manholes of 400 feet, unless otherwise specified by standards of the city. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than 0.7 percent for eight-inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-foot-wide easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines.
(c)
Alternative provision. If sanitary sewer is not available at the time of the development of the subdivision or land development, and if sanitary sewer is not anticipated to be available within a period of three years to serve the subdivision or land development in question, then on-site septic tanks, an oxidation pond, or another approved method of treatment of sanitary sewerage shall be installed by and at the expense of the subdivider or land developer in conformity with the requirements of the county health department and according to specifications adopted by the city.
(d)
Septic tanks. Where individual on-site wastewater disposal systems are allowed and proposed, individual lot sizes and shapes must exhibit appropriate regard for the peculiar health, drainage, and maintenance characteristics on the site. A minimum setback of 100 feet shall be observed between any well and any septic tank on the same lot. Additionally, detailed soil tests may be required in order to verify the ability of the lots to safely contain and dispose of septic system effluent. All septic tanks and on-site wastewater disposal systems are subject to the approval of the county health department.

ARTICLE V. - PERFORMANCE-BASED REGULATIONS

Sec. 26-139. - Purposes.
It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.
