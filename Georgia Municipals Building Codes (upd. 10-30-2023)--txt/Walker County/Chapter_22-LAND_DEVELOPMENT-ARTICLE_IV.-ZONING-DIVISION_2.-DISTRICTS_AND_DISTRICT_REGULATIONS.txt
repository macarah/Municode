The Director of Planning shall review the notification of the sponsoring agency in accordance with applicable requirements of this article.
(2)
Pursuant to such review, the Director of Planning may:
a.
Determine that the siting of the institutional residential home is in accordance with applicable requirements and approve the siting after review by the Planning Commission. If the siting is approved, the sponsoring agency may establish the home at the site selected.

b.
Does not meet applicable licensing criteria established by the Department of Human Resources, including requirements that the home be located to ensure the safe care and supervision of all clients in the home.

Would result in such a concentration of institutional residential homes in the area in proximity to the site selected, such that the nature and character of the area would be substantially altered. A home that is located within a radius of 1,200 feet of another existing institutional residential home shall be an over-concentration of such homes that substantially alters the nature and character of the area.
(4)

Sec. 22-152. - Planned unit development district.
(a)
Intent and purpose. The planned unit development district is established for the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage larger scale planned development which will produce a logically organized and compatibly-related set of land uses resulting in a higher overall quality of community development than if accomplished in incremental unplanned stages.
(2)
To allow a mixture and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established zoning district by careful site planning. The appropriate site improvements are incorporated into the plan which establish compatible relationships between uses within the site and uses adjacent to the site.
(3)
To encourage creative site design which seeks to preserve the open space and unique environmental features, conserve energy through efficient building design and clustering, efficiently use the land and increase the efficiency of public service delivery.
(4)
To be applied in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan.
(b)
General conditions. An area may be considered for rezoning to a planned unit development district if any 1 of the following conditions exist:
(1)
The characteristics of the specific site plan and uses proposed for the subject property would only be compatible with the surrounding area if the development were limited to those plans and uses as submitted.
(2)
Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same zoning district, are proposed for development on 1 or more adjacent parcels under single ownership.
(3)
Exceptions or variations from the size, frontage, density, uses or other standards which are required in the conventional zoning districts are being proposed as a part of a planned development.
(c)
Specific requirements. All proposed planned unit development district applications shall conform to the following specific requirements:
(1)
The site proposed for a planned unit development district classification must contain an area of 25 acres or more, unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission due to special and unusual circumstances. In no case shall the minimum lot size be less than 15 acres.
(2)
The site must abut a public street for a distance of at least 100 feet.
(3)
The plans required for inclusion in an application shall be prepared by a registered engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect, proof of which shall be their official registration seal appearing on the plans submitted.
(d)
Uses. Any use allowable inherently or by Planning Commission approval in a conventional zoning district herein may be proposed for inclusion in a planned unit development. Each proposed use should be consistent in application with the intent and purpose of the conventional zoning districts in which it is allowed. Only the specific uses proposed in an application and approved shall be allowed in the district. Any addition of uses, change of plans or increase in size or density shall require a separate amendment to the original approved planned unit development and shall follow the same administrative process as any other amendment. Initial approval of a planned unit development by the County does not mean that subsequent amendments to that planned development carry any requirement to be approved. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and land uses which are presented with an application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and, as such, shall become a part of these zoning regulations.
(e)
Required report and plans. Each planned unit development shall consist of a written report and a set of site plans prepared in accordance with the following guidelines:
(1)
Written report. A written report shall be submitted which will explain the type, nature, size, intent and characteristics of the proposed development. This report shall include, where applicable:
a.
A general description of the proposed development and its location.
b.
The proposed standards for development, including restrictions on the use of the property, density, yard setback requirements and any proposed restrictive covenants.
c.

Additional relevant data as may be required by the Planning Commission.
i.
Any other land development regulations as required by this chapter.
(2)
Site plan.
a.
A detailed site plan, prepared by a registered engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect, shall be required for all planned unit developments. The required site plan shall include, as a minimum, the following information:
1.
A survey of the property, indicating all property dimensions, property size, adjoining owners, scale, north arrow and tie in point to a known location (road intersection/land lot corner, etc.).
2.
Proposed platting (subdivision), streets, setbacks, building sites, type of use for each building site, ingress and egress to the site, internal access and circulation, off-street parking areas, proposed public facilities and open areas, name of the development and any special drainage features.
b.
If the proposal includes the subdivision of land for any purpose or for the provision of new public or private streets, the information required above and any additional information required for the submittal of plats under this chapter shall be submitted.

(d)
In determining whether to allow the raising of the nondomesticated animals not listed in this subsection, the Planning Commission shall balance the benefits of raising in the proposed type of animal with any possible detrimental effects that the raising of such animal may have on other properties; in conducting such balancing, the Planning Commission shall consider any objections made by either property owners, the approximate degree of emission of odors from this type of animal or from its actions, the tendency of such animals to escape fenced or other types of confinement, the noise typically emitted by this type of animal, any particular health aspects of such animal.
