Sec. 16-48. - Protection of groundwater recharge areas.
(a)
Generally. Groundwater is among the Nation's most important natural resources. It provides drinking water to urban and rural communities, supports irrigation and industry, sustains the flow of streams and rivers, and maintains riparian and wetland ecosystems. In many areas of the Nation, the future sustainability of ground-water resources is at risk from overuse and contamination. Because groundwater systems typically respond slowly to human actions, a long-term perspective is needed to manage this valuable resource. This article is intended to implement rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division known as the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, as they specifically relate to groundwater recharge areas (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. R. 391-3-16-.02). It is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the public that the quality of subsurface public drinking water be maintained. Groundwater resources exist in underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface that are capable of providing water for a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface, known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when development occurs within groundwater recharge areas. Certain land use activities, such as landfills, septic tanks, underground tanks, hazardous waste, and chemical spills, pose a significant threat to the quality of groundwater supplies. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land uses within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats and development impacts are minimized. To this end, this article establishes minimum lot sizes to provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management systems and regulates the issuance of land use and special use permits within significant groundwater recharge areas.

Sec. 16-49. - Wetlands protection.
Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well-being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map. Within areas shown on the generalized wetlands map, as defined by this article, the following shall apply:
(1)
Permit required. Prior to any permits being issued, the Planning and Development staff shall review the Generalized Wetlands Map to determine whether or not the land involved in the application for the permit contains wetlands. Permits shall not be issued involving properties identified as containing wetlands until and unless 1 of the following conditions has been met by the applicant for said permit:
a.
Documentation by the United States Army Corps of Engineers is provided to the Chairperson that said property does not contain a jurisdictional wetland and that the subject proposed development does not require a permit pursuant to section 404 of the United States Clean Water Act;
b.
Documentation by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, if provided to the Chairperson, that said property involving a jurisdictional wetland and the proposed development has received a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with section 404 of the United States Clean Water Act; or
c.
Documentation from a competent professional qualified to determine the location of wetlands is provided to the planning coordinator that said property does not contain a jurisdictional wetland, or that the subject development proposal will not disturb wetlands found to exist on the site. Said documentation shall specifically include the reference that the wetlands identification or finding that the site is outside of a jurisdictional wetland is based on a field study of the subject property and application of the Federal manual for identifying and delineating wetlands. Issuance of a permit under this part will not guarantee the issuance of a permit, or of a permit with any specific provisions, by the United States Army Corps of Engineers; and the County, the Chairperson, and the planning commission shall not be liable to the applicant, permit holder, successor in interest thereof, or any third party if the United States Army Corps of Engineers does not issue a permit or issues a permit under terms different from that issued by the County or the Chairperson.
(2)
County Health Department approval of permit required. No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the Planning and Development Department for a building, structure, or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank, unless the Walker County Environmental Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter DHR Manual) and this article.
(3)
Minimum lot size. Within an area governed by this article, new residential developments, new mobile home parks, or other land uses served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum lot sizes based on application of the DHR Manual. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be exempt from the minimum lot size requirements of this section.
(4)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within an area shown as a wetland on the Generalized Wetlands Map, to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.

Sec. 16-50. - Water supply watershed protection.
The quality of public drinking water supplies must be ensured. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation, which threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs and impair the quality of public drinking water supplies. Stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediments into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive, and rendering water resources unusable for recreation and other uses. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in potential risks of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. Therefore, land use activities within water supply watersheds must be regulated to ensure that public water supplies remain clean. This article establishes standards consistent with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. R. 391-3-16-.01) to ensure water quality in the watershed system is not compromised by land activities such as grading, septic systems, and accidental release of contaminants. The intent of this article is to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds, and to ensure water can be treated to meet Federal and State drinking water standards.
(1)
Requirements for large water supply watersheds with reservoirs. The following regulations shall apply to all lands within any large water supply watersheds with a water supply reservoir identified on the watershed protection map.
a.
Maintain a buffer with a minimum width of 100 feet on both sides of all perennial streams, as measured from the stream banks, within a 7-mile radius upstream of a water supply reservoir boundary.
b.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of all perennial streams, as measured from the stream banks, within a 7-mile radius upstream of a water supply reservoir boundary.
c.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the required 150-foot setback area on both sides of all perennial streams, as measured from the stream banks, within a 7-mile radius upstream of a water supply reservoir boundary.

Sec. 16-51. - Mountain and steep slope protection.
Steep slopes and thin soils characterize the mountains of Georgia. Because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land-disturbing activity on the high-elevation, steep-slope mountains of Georgia potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare, and economic progress of the State. Unregulated land-disturbing activity may endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation; has the potential to induce landslides; has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to the difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation; may damage the habitat for some species of wildlife (both plants and animals); and may detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty, which is vital to the recreation and tourism industry of North Georgia.
(1)
Permit required. No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the Planning and Development Department for any activity, land use, building, or structure within a protected mountain area or protected steep slope area, unless the activity, land use, building, or structure conforms to the requirements of this article. Prior to a land use permit or building permit being issued, the Planning Director shall require a site plan or subdivision plat in sufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of this article. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan.
(2)
Development regulations. Except as more specifically provided herein, the following regulations shall apply:
a.
Proposed land-disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, and all applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control and stormwater pollution prevention.
b.
Where septic tanks are to be used for individual sewage disposal, the proposed land-disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements imposed by the Local Governing Authority.
c.
Where 1 or more wells are to be used for an individual's water supply, the proposed land-disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements of the Water Well Standards Act of 1985; the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Department of Human Resources regarding individual or nonpublic wells; and any more stringent requirements imposed by the local Governing Authority.
d.
If sewage treatment is to be provided by any means other than 1 or more individual septic tanks, the sewage treatment shall meet all applicable requirements of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act.
e.
If a public water supply system is to be provided, the water supply system shall meet all applicable requirements of the Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977.
f.
Single-family dwellings shall not be constructed at a density of more than 1 per acre and no such acre shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building site. This does not replace the lot size restriction for septic tanks or zoning district requirements. The most restrictive requirement for lot sizes will be required. This density restriction shall not apply to:
1.
Any lot of less than 1 acre, if such a lot was, as of the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived in existence according to the tax register shown as a discrete parcel of real property on a plat of survey properly recorded in the real property records of the Clerk of Superior Court by the person owning the lot on said date; or
2.
Any land, or part of any land, which was contained in or subject to any master plan, planned unit development plan, special approved development plan, or any other development plan if such plan was filed with and approved by the Planning Commission prior to the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, pursuant to a duly enacted local ordinance; provided further, that any such ordinance must have provided for rules and procedures and governed lot sizes, density, types of buildings, and other limitations usually associated with the implementation of local zoning ordinances.
g.
Multifamily dwellings, in the absence of a public water supply and sewerage system, shall not be constructed at a density of more than 4 dwelling units per acre. If there is a public water supply and sewage system available to this property, then the density may be increased to no more than 6 dwelling units per acre. Regardless of which type of system, no such acre shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building site. (See Figure 6.) This does not replace the lot size restriction for septic tanks or zoning district requirements. The most restrictive requirement for lot sizes will be required.
Figure 6. Protected Mountain Residential
Density Regulations
h.
Structures shall not extend more than 40 feet, as measured from the highest point at which the foundation of such structure intersects the ground, above the uppermost point of the crest, summit, or ridge top of the protected mountain on which the structure is constructed. This height restriction shall not apply to water, cellular, radio, emergency, or television towers; to any equipment for transmission of electricity; to minor vertical projections of a parent building, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, antennas, poles, or wires. (See Figure 7.)
Figure 7. Protected Mountain Height Limits
and Exemptions from Height Limits
i.
Any application for a local building permit to construct a commercial structure shall contain a detailed landscaping plan (see Figure 8). Such landscaping plan shall: identify all trees which are to be removed that exceed 8 inches in diameter as measured at a point on the tree 4ยฝ feet above the surface of the ground; contain a plan for replacement of any such trees that are removed; and include a topographical survey of the project site and an assessment of the effect that the project will have on the environment of the protected mountain after the project has been completed and is in operation. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the plan shall conform to the specifications of said plan. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require commercial structures to comply with the density provision of single-family and multifamily dwellings.
Figure 8. Landscaping Plan and Topographic Survey
j.
Tree removal. No person engaging in land-disturbing activity shall remove more than 50 percent of the existing trees which exceed 8 inches in diameter as measured at a point on such a tree 4ยฝ feet above the surface of the ground; unless such person has filed, with the application, a plan of reforestation developed by a registered forester. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the plan shall conform to the specifications of said plan. (See Figure 9.)
