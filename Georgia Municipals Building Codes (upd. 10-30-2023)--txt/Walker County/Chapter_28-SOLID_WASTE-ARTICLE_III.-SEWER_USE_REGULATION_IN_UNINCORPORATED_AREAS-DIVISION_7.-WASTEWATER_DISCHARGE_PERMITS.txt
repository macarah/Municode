DIVISION 7. - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS

Sec. 28-254. - Applicability.
The provisions of this division are applicable to all industrial users of the POTW. The Authority has an "Approved POTW Pretreatment Program," as that term is defined in 40 CFR 403.3(d) and any permits issued hereunder to industrial users who are subject to or who become subject to a "National Categorical Pretreatment Standard" as that term is defined in 40 CFR 403.3(J) shall be conditioned upon the industrial user also complying with all applicable substantive and procedural requirements promulgated by the EPA or EPD regarding such categorical standards unless an exception for the Authority's program or for specific industrial categories is authorized.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 8-1)
Sec. 28-255. - Application and permit requirements for industrial users.
(a)
Prior to discharging nondomestic waste into the POTW, all significant industrial users of the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit. The industrial user shall request that the Authority determine if the proposed discharge is significant as defined in section 28-59. If the discharge is determined not to be significant, then the Authority may still establish appropriate discharge conditions for the user. Any noncategorical industrial user designated as significant may petition the Authority to be deleted from the list of significant industrial users on the grounds that there exists no potential for adverse effect on the POTW's operation or violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement.
(b)
All significant industrial users shall obtain an industrial wastewater discharge permit and shall complete such forms as required by the Authority, pay appropriate fees, and agree to abide by the provisions of this division and any specific conditions or regulations established by the Authority. All original applications shall be accompanied by a report containing the information specified in section 28-256.
(c)
The industrial user shall also submit revised plans to the Authority when alterations or additions to the user's premises affect said plans.
