DIVISION 6. - CONTROL OF PROHIBITED POLLUTANTS

Sec. 28-222. - Pretreatment requirements.
Industrial users of the POTW shall design, construct, operate, and maintain wastewater pretreatment facilities when necessary to reduce or modify the user's wastewater composition to achieve compliance with the limitations in wastewater strength set forth in section 28-188, to meet applicable national pretreatment standards, to prevent slug discharges, or to meet any other wastewater condition or limitation contained in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-1)
Sec. 28-223. - Plans and specifications.
(a)
Plans and specifications for wastewater monitoring and pretreatment facilities shall be prepared, signed, dated, and sealed by a registered engineer, and be submitted to the Authority for review in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The Authority shall review the plans within 45 days of receipt and recommend to the industrial user any appropriate changes. Prior to beginning construction of a monitoring or pretreatment facility, the user shall submit a set of construction plans and specifications to be maintained by the Authority. Prior to beginning construction, the industrial user shall also secure building, plumbing, and all other required permits.
(b)
The industrial user shall construct the pretreatment facility within the time provided in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. Following completion of construction, the industrial user shall provide the Authority with as-built drawings to be maintained by the Authority. The review of such plans and specifications will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facilities as necessary to produce an effluent complying with the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or methods of operations shall be reported to and be approved by the Authority prior to implementation.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-2)
Sec. 28-224. - Prevention of accidental discharges.
All users shall provide such facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the potential for accidental discharge into the POTW of waste regulated by this article from liquid or raw material storage areas, from truck loading and unloading areas, from in-plant transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this article. The wastewater discharge permit of any industrial user who has a history of significant leaks, spills, or other accidental discharge of waste regulated by this article shall be subject on a case-by-case basis to a special permit condition or requirement for the construction of facilities or establishment of procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for accidental discharge. Plans, specifications, and operating procedures for special permit conditions shall be developed by the user and submitted to the Authority for review under the provisions of section 28-223.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-3)
Sec. 28-225. - Oil and grease discharge control program.
(a)
Disposal of oil by discharge to the sewer system is not permitted. Oils include automotive lubricating oils, transmission and brake fluid, other industrial oils, and vegetable oils used in a restaurant or food processing facility.
(b)
The Authority shall contact all wastewater discharge permit holders, restaurants, service stations, septic tank pumpers, commercial food processors, oil tank firms and transporters, and others as appropriate, by letter as often as needed to advise them of requirements for oil and grease discharge control. These dischargers will also be informed of approved oil and grease disposal options available in the Walker County vicinity. The dischargers of oil and grease waste shall be required to provide an equivalent of primary treatment based on gravity separation of visible and floating oil and grease and oil and grease sludge from wastewater discharges. Such pretreatment processes shall be subject to the good management practices as required by section 28-229(f) and approval by the Authority. Dischargers shall also be subject to monitoring, entry, inspection, reporting, and other requirements as determined by the Authority at its discretion. These dischargers may be required by the Authority to apply for industrial waste discharge permits if the Authority determines that the dischargers are a source of prohibited pollutants, toxic pollutants in toxic amounts, or are otherwise controlled by Federal or State regulations. All dischargers of oil and grease as listed above are subject to all enforcement and penalty provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-4)
Sec. 28-226. - Slug discharge control program.
(a)
Each user shall provide protection from slug discharges of restricted materials or other substances regulated by this article as defined in section 28-59. No significant industrial user who commences discharge to the sewerage system after adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until the need for slug discharge control plans or procedures has been evaluated by the Authority. Each existing significant industrial user shall be evaluated by the Authority for the need for slug discharge control plans or procedures at least once by October 14, 2006.
(b)
Certain users will be required to prepare Slug Discharge Prevention and Contingency Plans (SDPC) showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection. These plans shall be submitted to the Authority for review and approval. All existing users required to have SDPC plans shall submit such a plan within 3 months after notification from the Authority and complete implementation within 6 months. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article.
(c)
Sludge discharge prevention plans shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.
(2)
Description of stored chemicals.
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in section 28-179.
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(d)
In the case of a slug discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately notify the POTW of the incident by telephone or in person. Information concerning the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective action shall be provided by the user. Within 5 days following a slug discharge, the user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures being taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewerage system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
(e)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's premises advising employees of a contact to call in the event of a slug discharge. The user shall ensure that all employees who may cause or allow such slug discharge to occur are advised of the proper emergency notification procedure.
(f)
Each significant industrial user shall immediately notify the Authority of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-5)
Sec. 28-227. - Prohibition of bypass.
(a)
Except as allowed in subsection (c) of this section, bypass is prohibited, and the Authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
(1)
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.
(3)
The industrial user submitted notices as required under in section 28-306.
(b)
The Authority may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effect if the Authority determines that it will meet the 3 conditions listed in subsection (a) of this section.
(c)
Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the reporting provisions of section 28-306.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-6)
Sec. 28-228. - Centralized waste treatment (CWT) facilities.
The Authority shall establish effluent limits for CWT facilities in order that the level of pollution discharged from the CWT through the POTW to the environment will not exceed the level that would be allowed if the CWT discharged directly to surface waters under section 301(b)(2) of the Act (33 USC 1311). Additionally, CWT facilities shall maintain records and submit reports as directed by the Authority regarding the SIC codes of their customers and the frequency, characteristics, and volume of wastes from the various categories.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 7-7)
Sec. 28-229. - Temporary exception to wastewater strength standard (local limits).
(a)
Applicability. This section provides a method for industrial users subject to the limitation on wastewater strength pollutants listed in section 28-188 to apply for and receive a temporary exception to the discharge level for 1 or more pollutants or parameters.
(b)
Time of application. Applicants shall apply for a temporary exception when they are required to apply for a wastewater discharge permit or renewal, provided that the Authority allows applications at any time unless the applicant has submitted the same or a substantially similar application within the preceding year that was denied by the Board.
(c)
Written applications. All applications for an exception shall be in writing and shall contain sufficient information for evaluation of each of the factors to be considered by the Authority pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(d)
Review by authority. All applications for an exception shall be reviewed by the Authority. If the application does not contain sufficient information for complete evaluation, the Authority shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and request additional information. The applicant shall have 30 days following notification by the Authority to correct such deficiencies. This 30-day period may be extended by the Authority upon application and for just cause shown. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Authority shall evaluate it within 30 days and approve or deny the application based upon the following factors:
(1)
The Authority shall consider if the applicant is subject to a national pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more stringent than those in section 28-188 and grant an exception only if such exception is within limitations of applicable Federal regulations.
(2)
The Authority shall consider if the exception would apply to discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the EPA under the provisions of section 307(a) of the Act (33 USC 1317(a)), or similar State regulation, and then grant an exception only if such exception may be granted within the limitations of Federal and State regulations.
(3)
The Authority shall consider if the exception would create conditions or a hazard to Authority personnel or would reduce the effectiveness of the treatment works, taking into consideration the concentration of said pollutant in the treatment works' influent and the design capability of the treatment works.
(4)
The Authority shall consider the possibility of the exception causing the treatment works to violate its NPDES permit.
(5)
The Authority shall consider if the exception would cause elements or compounds to be present in the sludge of the treatment works which would prevent sludge use or disposal by the Authority or which would cause the Authority to violate any regulation promulgated by EPA under the provisions of section 405 of the Act (33 USC 1345) or similar State regulatory measure.
(6)
The Authority may consider the cost of pretreatment or other types of control techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction, but prohibitive cost alone shall not be the basis for granting an exception.
(7)
The Authority may consider the age of equipment and industrial facilities involved to the extent that such factors affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.
(8)
The Authority may consider the process employed by the user and process changes available which would affect the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.
(9)
The Authority may consider the engineering aspects of various types of pretreatment or other control techniques available to the user to improve the quality or quantity of wastewater discharge.
(10)
The Authority may consider an application for exception based upon the fact that water conservation measures instituted or proposed by the user result in a higher concentration of particular pollutants in the wastewater discharge of the user without increasing the amount of mass of pollutants discharged. To be eligible for an exception under this subsection, the applicant must show that except for water conservation measures, the applicant's discharge has been or would be in compliance with the limitations on wastewater strength set forth in section 28-188. No such exception shall be granted if the increased concentration of pollutants in the applicant's wastewater would have significant adverse impact upon the operation of the POTW.
(e)
Review by Board. The Board shall review any appeal to a denial by the Authority of an application for an exception and shall take into account the same factors considered by the Authority. At such hearing, the applicant and the Authority shall have the right to present relevant proof by oral or documentary evidence. The procedure set forth in section 28-348 shall be applicable to such a hearing. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof in an appeal hearing.
(f)
Good management practices required. The Authority shall not grant an exception unless the applicant demonstrates to the Authority that good management practices (GMPs) are being employed to prevent or reduce the contribution of pollutants to the POTW. GMPs include, but are not limited to, preventive operating and maintenance procedures, schedule of activities, process changes, prohibiting activities, and other management practices to reduce the strength or quantity of effluent discharged and to control plant site runoff, spillage, leaks, and drainage from raw material storage.
