Classification levels. The term "classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous or vicious dog pursuant to this division. Classifications are as follows:
(1)
Dangerous dog. Any dog that:
a.
Causes a puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 6-21); provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection;
b.
Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 6-21) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or
c.
While off the owner's property, kills a domestic animal; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where the death of such domestic animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog.
(2)
Vicious dog. Any dog that inflicts a serious injury on a person or causes serious injury (see section 6-21) to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape the dog's attack.
(3)
Euthanasia for causing serious injury on more than 1 occasion. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, a dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided below, to have caused a serious injury to a human on more than 1 occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection.
(4)
Judge authorized to order euthanasia. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-25, the Judge of any Superior Court of competent jurisdiction within this State may order the euthanasia of a dog if the Court finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided by this section, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article; and
a.
The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any State criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or
b.
Any local governmental authority has filed with the Court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog.
(5)
Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived as a potentially dangerous dog in this State shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog.

If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived.
(5)
Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment; the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this division. Animal control may specify additional terms as required.
(c)
Criminal matters; bond. The provisions of subsection (a)(4) or (b)(5) of this section shall not apply to an animal that was an object or instrumentality of a crime nor shall any such animal be returned to the owner without the approval of the prosecuting attorney and Animal Control. If dogs are impounded for violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 or 16-12-37, they shall not be returned to the owner until the case is completed, or unless otherwise ordered by the court. In such cases, the owner shall be required to post a surety bond for the costs of impoundment of the dog for the duration of the proceeding, in the amount of $1,500.00 per animal impounded, or shall release the animals to Animal Control for disposal. The surety bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this State, or the bond may be paid in cash. If bond is not posted within 30 days of impoundment, Animal Control shall apply to the court for permission to dispose of the animal prior to trial of the criminal case as provided by law.
(d)
Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed, or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

Within 30 days after receiving a written request for a hearing, the Animal Control Board shall hold a hearing following the procedures established in this division:
(1)
The scope of the hearing shall be limited to whether the impounding of the animal was authorized under this division or State law;
(2)
If the Board finds that the animal was improperly impounded, the animal shall be returned to the owner and the costs incurred in providing reasonable care and treatment for the animal from the date of impoundment to the date of the order shall not be charged to the owner. If the animal is impounded under contract with a third party, the animal shelter shall pay for such costs of boarding and treatment;
(3)
If the Board finds that the animal was lawfully impounded, the Board may:
a.
Recommend the shelter dispose of the animal in accordance with this section; or
b.
Unless, in a prior administrative or legal action, the owner has been found to have failed to provide humane care to an animal, committed cruelty to animals, or engaged in dogfighting in violation of the laws of this State or of the United States or any of the several states, recommend conditions under which the animal may, upon payment by the owner of all costs of impoundment and care, be returned to the owner. Such conditions shall be reduced to writing and served upon the owner and the animal shelter.

Sec. 6-113. - Return of animal to owner.
(a)
Return of animals at large.

If there is no one present, the Officer shall impound the animal and leave written notice of whom the owner must contact to reclaim the animal. The owner shall be cited for violation of this division.
(b)
Return of animals with violations. If an animal is impounded for a violation, and the procedure for return is not otherwise specified in this division or a hearing is not otherwise requested or required, the animal shall be returned once all fees for the violation and impoundment are paid and the conditions necessitating the impoundment have been cured or corrected, if applicable.
(c)
Impoundment fees. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal shall pay such fees as the Animal Control Director may impose for impoundment, boarding and veterinary care if impounded at the shelter (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off site).
(d)
Second impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a second impoundment within 1 year shall pay an impoundment fee double the amount of the fee charged for the first impoundment, plus such fees as the Animal Control Director may impose for boarding and veterinary care (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off site).
(e)
Third and subsequent impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a third or subsequent impoundment within 1 year shall pay an impoundment fee quadruple the amount of the fee charged for the first impoundment, plus such fees as the Animal Control Director may impose for boarding and veterinary care (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off site).

If in the opinion of a licensed accredited veterinarian or a veterinarian employed by the State or Federal government any animal impounded pursuant to this chapter has a temperament or condition such that euthanasia is the only reasonable course of action, the animal shelter shall dispose of the animal in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1.
(d)
Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed, or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

Written agreement. Every person adopting a dog or cat shall enter into a written agreement at the time of the adoption with the animal shelter or humane society guaranteeing that sterilization will be performed by a licensed veterinarian within 30 days of the sexual maturity of the animal.

Evidence required. Any person acquiring an animal from the animal shelter or humane society, which animal is not sterile at the time of acquisition, shall submit to the animal shelter or humane society a signed statement from the licensed veterinarian performing the sterilization required by subsection (a) of this section within 7 days after such sterilization attesting that such sterilization has been performed.

Variances may be granted by Animal Control in cases where undue hardship would result from the strict enforcement of this division and where the protection of the health and well-being of the citizens of Walker County can be achieved with reasonable mitigating actions. Hardships created by action of the applicant shall not be considered as a justification for a variance. Denial of a request for a variance may be appealed to the Animal Control Board by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal with the Animal Control Board within 15 days of the denial.
(b)
Notice of variance appeal. Persons who appeal to the Animal Control Board the denial of a variance from any requirement of this division shall notify adjacent property owners of their application for a variance and the time and location of the hearing on the variance appeal.
