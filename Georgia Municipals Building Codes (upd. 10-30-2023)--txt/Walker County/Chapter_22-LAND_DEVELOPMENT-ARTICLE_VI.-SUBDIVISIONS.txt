Sec. 22-395. - Procedure for approval of subdivisions of land for sale at auction.
(a)
General. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat for the purpose of sale at auction shall be determined by the following:
(1)
If the plan includes the construction of a new access road disturbing 1 acre or more or a new County road or any other land-disturbing activity exceeding 1 acre prior to the sale, the subdivider shall be responsible for meeting the requirements of a minor or a major subdivision, whichever applies, and shall not be eligible to use the regulations in this section.
(2)
If the plan does not include any land-disturbing activities prior to the sale the subdivider shall meet the regulations in this section.
(3)
If the proposed auction plat divides the property into lots consisting of 3 acres or more, then section 22-397 shall apply.
(4)
The initial step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a proposed auction plat, together with required certificates and any additional plans, if any, that are required under the Walker County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance (as amended), the Walker County Stormwater Management Ordinance (as amended), and any State required permits.
(b)
Pre-application. The subdivider and or the auction company shall consult early and informally with the Planning Commission to obtain advice and assistance before he begins to prepare the preliminary plat. This will enable him to become familiar with the County Thoroughfare Plan and other official plans, which might affect the area.
(c)
Preliminary plat approval. For the purpose of subdividing property for auction, preliminary plat is the concept plan. Therefore, subdivision requirements as far as building setbacks, road frontage, any requirements by the Health Department or the State, etc., do apply. If an existing drive will be utilized to access 3 acre lots or more that do not have County road frontage and no additional land will be disturbed, then no Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan shall be required. If new access drives are to be constructed prior to the sale with 1 acre or more of disturbed land, then an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan for the drive shall be required and shall be implemented before the project is eligible for Final Plat approval. If there will be no street improvements, installation of any utilities, until after the sale of the property, then there shall be no requirements for an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan by the subdivider; however, the following shall be noted on the auction plat:
"Note: Any further development involving any land disturbance, including, but not limited to, clearing, grading, grubbing, etc., may require a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan and Stormwater Management Plan before any permit is issued.
All development involving land disturbance, including, but not limited to, clearing, grubbing, grading, etc., is required by State law and local ordinance to use best management practices (BMPs) to ensure that no soil leaves their site or enters into any State waters.
If a joint permanent access easement is to be installed by all affected property owners, it shall be their responsibility jointly to obtain an erosion and sedimentation control plan, if required, and/or to install and maintain BMPs."
(1)
The application for preliminary plat approval, including 6 prints of complete subdivision plans, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the Planning Commission's regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning Director or his designee shall have 10 days to review and approve or disapprove the preliminary plat for all auction plats. In the event that a plan is disapproved, the auction company or subdivider shall be provided a written statement as to the reason for the disapproval. If changes shall be required before approval, it shall be done so on the final plat.
(2)
The Planning Department, before its review, shall transmit a print of the preliminary plat to the Office of the County Board of Commissioners of Walker County, Georgia, and it shall be the duty of the Chairperson, or his designee, to inspect the property to be divided and the construction of any roads or streets in said subdivision. The Planning Department, before its review, may transmit prints of the preliminary plat to each utility service, Health Department, Fire Department, and any other agency for review and recommendations in relation to specific service problems. A print of the preliminary plat may also be transmitted to the Coosa Valley Regional Development Center for its review and recommendations.
(3)
The preliminary plat of the subdivision at a scale of not more than 1 inch equals 100 feet shall show the following:
a.
Name and location of the subdivision;
b.
The name and address of the owner and person to be notified of official actions;
c.
North point, graphic scale and date; north point shall be identified as magnetic, true or grid north;
d.
Topography at contour intervals shown by the topographic maps used by Tennessee Valley Authority, if slopes of 20 percent or greater exist on the parent parcel;
e.
The location of all existing and proposed street or roads within the subdivision and adjacent to it;
f.
The width and purpose of any existing and proposed rights-of-way and easements in said subdivision;
g.
The total amount of acreage to be subdivided and the amount of acreage contained in each tract or lot in said subdivision;
h.
Any portion of the land in the subdivision subject to periodic inundation by storm drainage, overflow or ponding shall be clearly shown and identified on the plat;
i.
Names of all streets, roads and alleys and other rights-of-way;
j.
The parent map and parcel with any division from that parcel shown. The map and parcel numbers should also be shown;
k.
If required, a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan completed in accordance with the Walker County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance (including hydrology) and the Walker County Stormwater Management Ordinance;
l.
If applicable, the most current floodplain information shall be shown.
(4)
Two copies of the preliminary plat shall be retained in the Planning Commission files, and 1 copy shall be returned to the subdivider at the time of approval or disapproval, with the Planning Commission's stamp, signed by the Secretary of the Planning Commission or another duly qualified member of the Commission, along with any required changes or modifications endorsed thereon. Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Department shall not constitute acceptance of the final plat.
(5)
Approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless a final plat of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat, in substantial conformance therewith, is submitted within 12 months from date of such approval, unless an extension of time is specifically applied for by the subdivider and expressly granted by the Planning Commission.
(d)
Construction of improvements. After the preliminary plat and any required erosion control plans have been approved and permitted, the subdivider may proceed with any land disturbance to prepare the land for sale.
(e)
Final plat. The application for final plat approval, including 6 prints of complete subdivision plans, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Planning Commission at least 15 days prior to the Planning Commission's regularly scheduled meeting, for divisions of more than 8 lots. For divisions of 8 lots or less, the Planning Staff shall have 15 days to review and approve or disapprove the final plat. In the event that a plan is disapproved, the auction company or subdivider shall be provided a written statement as to the reason for the disapproval.
(1)
The Planning Commission, before its review, shall transmit a print of the final plat to the Board of Commissioners of Walker County, Georgia, and it shall be the duty of the Chairperson, or his designee, to inspect the property to be divided and the construction of any roads or streets in said subdivision. The Planning Commission, before its review, may transmit prints of the final plat to each utility service, Health Department, Fire Department, and any other agency for review and recommendations in relation to specific service problems. A print of the final plat may also be transmitted to the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission for its review and recommendations.
(2)
Prior to a decision on the final plat by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall afford a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be sent at least 5 days prior to the date of hearing.
(3)
Final plat approval shall be obtained by the subdivider or the auction company, only after all requirements of the Walker County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan have been met or after a period of 15 days to review the plans. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved.
(4)
The final plat shall contain all of the information which was required on the preliminary plat except the topographic contour lines shown on the preliminary plat and shall be drawn in compliance with all the appropriate laws of the State of Georgia which govern the recordation of subdivision plats.
(5)
The following certification shall be presented along with the final plat, if applicable:
a.
Certification by a registered Georgia land surveyor (seal affixed) of the accuracy of the survey and plat and the placement of all required monuments.
b.
Certification by the subdivider showing that the applicant is the legal owner of the land, and that he formerly dedicates all streets, roads and rights-of-way for public use.
c.
Georgia Department of Transportation certification of approval must be included for the proposed project if the project abuts any State or Federal Roads, or certification by the Walker County Road Department if the property abuts any County Roads.
d.
Certification by the subdivider that all lands considered for development do not fall within the floodplain or floodprone area. If any part of the development falls within a floodplain or floodprone area, then the requirements of sections 22-361 and 22-362 will apply.
e.
Certification of Inspection by the Project Engineer that the site has been inspected and is installed according to the approved plan or that modifications to the plan are designed and installed using sound engineering principles and practices.
(6)
When the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission or Planning Director, whichever applies, 1 copy with the approval of the Planning Commission certified therein shall be returned to the subdivider to be used for filing with the Clerk of the Court as the official plat of record. Within 10 calendar days from the date of final approval, the subdivider shall record the final plat in the office of the Clerk of Court.
(7)
Copies of the approved final plat will be delivered by the Planning Commission to a minimum of the following locations, if applicable:
a.
2 copies of Plat to the Zoning and Development Department.
b.
1 copy of Plat to the Walker County Assessors' Office.
c.
1 copy of Plat to Emergency 9-1-1 Office.
d.
1 copy of Plat to Health Department (if property shall be serviced by septic systems).
(8)
The Planning Commission must consider a final plat within 15 days after the submission of the final plat for review. Failure of the Planning Commission to act on a final plat submission within these 15 days shall be considered as approval of same. If the plat is disapproved, grounds for such disapproval shall be stated in writing in the official file of the Planning Commission and shall be stated in writing on 2 copies of the plat. One copy of the plat shall be retained in the Planning Commission files and 1 copy shall be returned to the subdivider at the time of the disapproval.
(Ord. of 11-18-2004(2), § 9.13)
Sec. 22-396. - Procedure for approval of subdivisions of land containing tracts consisting of 3 acres or more which front on existing County roads.
(a)
General. The division of land into parcels of 3 acres or more which front on existing roads, which are approved by the Governing Authority of Walker County, Georgia, are not subject to the subdivision regulations for the County whether for sale at auction or otherwise; however, the plat must be review and approved by the Planning Commission or Planning Director or his designee, whichever applies based on the number of lots. However, this does not release a builder from State or Federal regulations regarding land disturbance.
(b)
Pre-application. The subdivider and or the auction company shall consult early and informally with the Planning Commission to obtain advice and assistance before he begins to prepare the preliminary plat. This will enable him to become familiar with the County Thoroughfare Plan and other official plans, which might affect the area.
(c)
Preliminary plat approval. The process for preliminary plat approval shall be the same for all auction plats as applicable in section 22-395. The process for preliminary plat approval for all subdivisions shall be the same as applicable in section 22-393. For the purpose of subdividing property for auction, preliminary plat is the concept plan. Therefore, subdivision requirements as far as building setbacks, road frontage, any requirements by the Health Department or the State, etc., do apply.
(1)
If an existing drive will be utilized to access lots consisting of 3 acres or more that do not have County road frontage and no additional land will be disturbed, then no Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan (ESCP) shall be required.
(2)
If a new drive will be built, then an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan may be required depending on the amount of land to be disturbed and State law shall apply. If an ESCP is required, it shall be submitted to the Planning Office along with the Preliminary Plat for review and approval or disapproval.
(3)
If no land-disturbing activity shall take place prior to the sale, then no ESCP is needed. However, the following shall be noted on the plat:
"Note: Any further development involving any land disturbance, including, but not limited to, clearing, grading, grubbing, etc., may require a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan and Stormwater Management Plan before any permit is issued. All development involving land disturbance, including, but not limited to, clearing, grubbing, grading, etc., is required by State law and local ordinance to use best management practices (BMPs) to ensure that no soil leaves their site or enters into any State waters. If a joint permanent access easement is to be installed by all affected property owners, it shall be their responsibility jointly to obtain an erosion and sedimentation control plan, if required, and/or to install and maintain BMPs."
(4)
If 90 percent of the total land area is being subdivided into lots consisting of 3 acres or more then the ESCP shall be required for only those lots that are less than 3 acres. If more than 10 percent of the total land area is to be subdivided into lots consisting of less than 3 acres, then the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan shall be required for the entire project and this section shall not apply.
(d)
Construction of improvements. After the preliminary plat and any required erosion control plans, if applicable, have been approved, the subdivider may proceed with any land disturbance to prepare the land for sale.
(e)
Final plat. The application for final plat approval, including 6 prints of complete subdivision plans, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Planning Commission at least 15 days prior to the Planning Commission's regularly scheduled meeting, for divisions of more than 8 lots. For divisions of 8 lots or less, the Planning Staff shall have 15 days to review and approve or disapprove the final plat.

(d)
To ensure development of the community in substantial conformity with the general principles set forth in the official plans and map of the County, the Planning Commission may require that the subdivider reserve open space for parks, schools, fire stations, playgrounds and any other use essential to the welfare of the County. When there is no area officially designated in the official plans and maps, the location of the open space shall be mutually agreed upon by the Planning Commission and the subdivider. However, no more than 10 percent of the total subdivision may be required by donation. If additional area over 10 percent of a proposed subdivision is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the County, the additional area shall be offered for sale to the County at its fair market value. Such offer shall extend for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by the County of such written offer.
(e)

The design and specifications of the distribution system shall meet the State water supply requirements. Water mains shall be extended the full length or width of the pavement.
b.
If a private system is installed, it shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of a public system. If septic tanks are installed, special approval must be obtained from the Health Department. Lot size shall not be less than the minimum standard, and shall be of satisfactory size for the proper installation of a septic tank sewage system as indicated by percolation tests.
(7)
Storm sewers and drainage structures. Storm sewers and drainage structures shall be designed and installed as required in accordance with good engineering practice. In no case shall the size of pipe used for storm drainage be less than 15 inches in diameter. The subdivider shall provide either:
a.
Portland cement concrete or asphaltic concrete curb, the face of which shall not be less than 6 inches in height, with backfill sloping toward the curb and higher than the curb to ensure drainage of surface water into the storm drainage system; or
b.
Properly constructed drainage ditches, with the valley line of the ditch at least 6 feet from the edge of the roadway surface. Where possible, the slopes of the ditch should be in a ratio of at least 3:1, but in no case shall they exceed a ratio of 2:1. Where the grade of the roadway exceeds 5 percent, the Planning Commission may require the developer to rip rap the ditches.

(Ord. of 6-24-2004(3), § 9.36)
Sec. 22-421. - Multifamily subdivision or development—Design standards.
(a)
General. It is the intent of this section to provide regulations for the development of townhouses, duplexes, condos, row houses and attached homes, single-family zero lot line dwellings (also called patio or balcony homes), and/or mixed use moderate density residential development in a manner which is attractive, provides for efficient use of land, and is compatible with surrounding development. It is further intended that these regulations provide for standards, which will foster compatibility between multifamily development (allowed in R-2 and R-3) and lower density, standard single-family uses (more so R-1 developments). It is also intended these developments, if sold, be sold in "fee simple" to encourage owner occupancy. For purposes of these developments, the term "exterior street" refers to any public, dedicated and accepted street existing prior to the multifamily subdivision/development, the term "interior street" refers to any street built as part of the multifamily subdivision/development, both sides of which are included as part of the design for the development.
(b)
Conformity to comprehensive plan. All proposed subdivisions shall conform to any comprehensive County or regional plan and zoning regulations.
(1)
The population densities established by the Comprehensive Plan shall be observed by the subdivider and developer.
(2)
All thoroughfares in the Thoroughfare Plan shown crossing or bordering a proposed subdivision are required to be provided for in the location and at the right-of-way width designated on the Thoroughfare Plan.
(3)
To ensure development of the community in substantial conformity with the general principles set forth in the official plans and map of the County, the Planning Commission may require that the subdivider reserve open spaces for parks, schools, fire stations, playgrounds, and any other use essential to the welfare of the County. When there is no area officially designated in the official plans and maps, the location of the open space shall be mutually agreed upon by the Planning Commission and the subdivider. However, no more than 10 percent of the total subdivision may be required by donation. If additional area over 10 percent of a proposed subdivision is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the County, the additional area shall be offered for sale to the County at its fair market value. Such offer shall extend for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by the County of such written offer.
(4)
Clearly noted on the preliminary plat should be all the improvements the owner proposes to make pursuant to the development of the subdivision. These improvements shall relate to drainage, utilities, and other improvements clearly noted on the preliminary plat should be all the improvements the owner proposes to request the County or utility companies to make, relative to off-premises improvements necessary to the development of the subdivision.
These improvements shall relate to drainage improvements necessary to carry runoff to a major drainage channel, and also all extensions of water mains, sewers, and other utility extensions.
