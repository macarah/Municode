"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."

If the Public Officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The Public Officer and Governing Authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

The Clerk of Superior Court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the County and enter the lien on the general execution docket.

(l)

Sec. 8-63. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created.
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life, safety and general welfare of residents and visitors of the County, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the County. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property does not guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that the property has been constructed, maintained or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The County reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the County, its officers, employees, or agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or later be created. To the extent any Federal or State law or regulation requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan, or design approval, inspection or other activity by the County, its officers, employees, or agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection does not constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it remains the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professionals, and contractors to satisfy such legal requirements.

Any person who shall allow any boisterous, noisy, drunken or riotous persons to assemble or remain in their house, apartment or upon their property, after receiving oral notice from a Police Officer that boisterous, noisy, drunken or carousing activities have caused complaint and annoyance to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the County; provided, however, no person shall be charged under this section unless the owner or person in possession of the premises has been afforded an opportunity to disburse the assembly or offending person from the premises. This section shall not preclude a Police Officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.
