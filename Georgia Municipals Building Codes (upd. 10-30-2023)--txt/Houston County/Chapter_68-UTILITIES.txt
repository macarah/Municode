DIVISION 3. - BACKFLOW PREVENTION AND CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL

Sec. 68-101. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. In addition, the definitions found in the Georgia Plumbing Code, latest edition, for backflow, cross connections and backflow prevention devices shall apply for purposes of this division.
Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
Cross connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system, or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to any line supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection.
Cross connection, controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Director of the county water system means the director in charge of the county water system, who is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection control program of containment and for the enforcement of the provisions of this division.
Hazard, degree of. This term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.
(1)
Health hazard means any condition, device or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the director may create, a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer.
(2)
Plumbing hazard means a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or approved backflow prevention device.
(3)
Pollutional hazard means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
(4)
System hazard means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include but shall not be limited to polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulating cooling water connected to an open cooling tower or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions; and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes.
Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. The term "service connection" shall also include a water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.
Water, used means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.

(2)
Promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the customer's in-plant potable water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and
(3)
Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
(Code 1976, § 5-1031(a))
Sec. 68-103. - Responsibilities of customer.
The water customer shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If an approved backflow prevention device is required at the customer's water service connection for the safety of the water system, the director or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to the customer to install such an approved backflow prevention device at a specific location on his premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved device, at his own expense. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such device shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. Turn-off and turn-on fees must be paid by the customer prior to restoration of service for services that are disconnected due to failure to comply with this division.

(Code 1976, § 5-1033)
Sec. 68-106. - Prerequisites for water service connection.
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this division. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention device required by this division and state law is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. Applicable requirements for backflow prevention will be complied with prior to service connection.
(Code 1976, § 5-1034)
Sec. 68-107. - Right of entry; disconnection of water service.
The water customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the county water department and county health department to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this division, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with state and county statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(Code 1976, § 5-1035)
Sec. 68-108. - Required backflow prevention devices.
(a)
An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served, but in all cases before the first branch line leading off the service line, wherever the following conditions exist:
(1)
In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the director, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
(2)
In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
(3)
In the case of premises having internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention device in the service line.
(b)
The type of protective device required under subsection (a) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists, as follows:
(1)
