Sec. 90-172. - Districts shown on maps.
The boundaries of the various districts are shown on a Zoning Map of Rincon, which is located in the office of the city hall.

Sec. 90-173. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries.
When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Rincon, the following rules shall apply:
(A)
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as approximately following the center line of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way line, stream bed or river bed or such center lines extended, then such center lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
(B)
Where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the city, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
(C)
Where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the center line of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and as being parallel thereto.
(D)
Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary; and provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply.
