ARTICLE II. - UTILITY BILLING

Sec. 82-31. - Payment; delinquency; penalties; nonpayment; disconnection and discontinuance of service; reconnection fees.
All utility bills will be mailed by the first day of each month.
To avoid a ten percent penalty charge all utility bills must be paid in full by the 15 th day of each month. If the fifteenth (15 th ) day of the month falls on a non business day, the penalty will be assessed at 11:59 p.m. on the next regularly scheduled work day for the City of Rincon.
To avoid an interruption of service (disconnection) all utility bills must be paid in full by the 20 th > day of each month. The failure of the city to insist upon the penalty charge and/or disconnection of services shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent penalties and/or disconnection of service if future utility bills are not paid in a timely manner as outlined above.
Should an interruption of service (disconnection) occur there will be a $25.00 service interruption fee added to the utility bill. An interruption of service is considered to have taken place at 11:59 p.m. on the 20 th > day of each month whether or not the service has been physically interrupted (disconnected). If an interruption of service (disconnection) does occur there shall be no penalty charges added to the service interruption fee.
If the 20 th day of the month falls on a non-business day, then the actual interruption (disconnection) of service will take place on the next regularly scheduled workday for the City of Rincon. This will not eliminate the $25.00 service interruption fee charge referred to in the paragraph listed above.

Sec. 82-35. - Adjustment of utility bills.
The city manager or his designee shall have the authority to adjust disputed sewer bills and water bills in accordance with this section, for any monthly billing cycle, when the disputed sewer and/or water bill is caused from a water leak the utility customer experiences. The consumer shall be under an affirmative duty to prove that the usage was caused by some type of leak. The consumer shall cause the leak to be repaired, and the consumer shall submit the sewer bill and/or water bill, a copy of the repair bill, and/or an affidavit stating that the leak has been repaired to the city manager.
Upon receipt of the required documents, the city manager shall determine if a water leak existed and shall have the authority to adjust the consumer's water bill based upon the consumer's water bill for the same months in the prior year, if the consumer was a customer at that time, or if the consumer was not a customer in the same months of the prior year, then use the average of the consumer's water billings, since becoming a customer, or use 300 gallons per day for the billing cycle, whichever is less.
In addition, upon determination that a water leak existed, the city manager shall have the authority to adjust the consumer's sewer bill, for any monthly billing cycle, in the like manner of the water bill above.
