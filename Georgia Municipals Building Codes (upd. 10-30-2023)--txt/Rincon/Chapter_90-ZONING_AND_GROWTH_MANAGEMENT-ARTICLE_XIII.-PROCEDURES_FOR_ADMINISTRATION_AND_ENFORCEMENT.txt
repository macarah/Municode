ARTICLE XIII. - PROCEDURES FOR ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
It shall be unlawful for any person to commence excavation for, or construction of any building or structure, or moving of any existing building or structure without first obtaining a permit from the Building and Zoning Department. No permit shall be issued for the construction or alteration of any building or structure until proper approval has been granted and fees have been submitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Sec. 90-331. - Permits required for construction.
The following is a list of permits needed for construction of a building or structure or the movement of a building or structure that may be needed for any type of land development in the City of Rincon, Georgia.
(A)
Building permit. A building permit issued by the Building and Zoning Department is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving or alteration of any building or structure. All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat or plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size of the building to be erected, the location of the building on the lot, the number of dwelling units the design is to accommodate, and such other information as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this chapter are being observed. A record of such application and plats or plans shall be kept by the Building and Zoning Department. A building permit is also required for swimming pools, and lawn irrigation systems.
(B)
Relocation permit. A relocation permit is required anytime a manufactured home, mobile home, trailer, out building, house or structure is moved from any location to any lot or parcel within the city limits of Rincon. Electrical, mechanical and plumbing permits are included within this permit. Buildings used for the purpose of storage only with no need for electricity or plumbing are exempt from this requirement.
(C)
Sign permit. Prior to the erection of a sign for either on premises or off premises advertising, the Building and Zoning Department must first issue a permit in accordance with the sign regulations set forth in the City of Rincon Sign Ordinance. Permits are required for both temporary signs as well as permanent signs.
(D)
Demolition permit. Prior to destruction of a building, structure, or sign, a demolition permit is needed. Such permit may be attained from the Building and Zoning Department.
(E)
Electrical permit. An electrical permit is needed before installing any electrical wiring or fixtures. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure.
(F)
Plumbing permit. A plumbing permit is needed whenever a plumber installs a new plumbing system in an existing structure. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure.
(G)
Mechanical permit. A mechanical permit is needed before a licensed installer may install any mechanical device such as a heating and/or cooling system for air or water. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure.
(H)
Subdivision of land. Whenever a lot, parcel, or tract of land is divided into two or more parts, the owner must submit a preliminary subdivision plat to the Building and Zoning Department. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the Planning and Zoning Board and then by the City Council at a public hearing to follow.
Once the preliminary plat is approved by City Council, required infrastructure improvements may be permitted on the property. After the required infrastructure improvements are completed and inspected by the Building and Zoning Department, a final plat may be submitted to the City Planner.
The final plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the Planning and Zoning Board and then by the City Council at a public hearing to follow. Once the final plat is approved by the City Council, all parcels created by the subdivision may be recorded in the Office of the Superior Court of Effingham County and subsequently become real estate.
Subdivisions of three lots or less may be considered a minor subdivision where the preliminary and final plat procedures are combined into one. However, subdivisions of four lots and more or any division where infrastructure improvements are required will be considered as major subdivisions and must endure the complete process.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-332. - Permits or actions required by this chapter.
The following are permits that may be required depending on the construction and particular land use district for which it will take place:
(A)
Conditional use permits. There are specific land uses permitted in certain zoning districts only after a review by the Planning and Zoning Board, a public hearing has been held by the City Council, and the City Council has determined that the use is appropriate based on certain criteria. These uses are listed throughout article IV and the criteria is listed in section 7 of this article.
(B)
Site plan approval. All land development activities other than residential one- and two-family structures, regardless of the zoning district, must present a site plan of such development to the Building and Zoning Department and City Engineer for review prior to the issuance of any land development permits. The site plan is also reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board and forwarded to the City Council for approval once all comments are addressed.
(C)
Zoning variance. Where strict enforcement of this chapter may present an unnecessary hardship upon a lot or parcel of land, the owner may apply for a zoning variance. Such action requires a public meeting by the Planning and Zoning Board and approval by the City Council at a scheduled public hearing.
(D)
Amendment to the zoning map. An amendment to the zoning map is considered to be an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Such action requires a public meeting by the Planning and Zoning Board and approval by the City Council at a scheduled public hearing.
(E)
Amendment to the text of this chapter. An amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance follows the same process as an amendment to the zoning map. However, a text amendment requires different materials to be included with the application.
(F)
Permits required in conjunction with permits in this chapter. The following are permits required by other government entities that may be applicable to a development project in Rincon.
(G)
Land-disturbing activity permit. Under the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Act, any disturbance of land of over 1 1/10 of an acre requires a land disturbance permit from the Building and Zoning Department.
(H)
Construction in wetlands. In conjunction with Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains the authority to delineate the location of wetlands and is responsible for permitting any land-disturbing activity in them under Federal Clean Water Act.

Individual well systems. Individual well systems are prohibited within the City of Rincon.
(J)
Individual sewer systems. Individual sewer systems are prohibited within the City of Rincon.

Deceleration lanes are required at all entrances on high traffic roadways within the city limits.
(L)
Shallow wells for irrigation only. If a property owner decides to use a shallow well for the irrigation of his or her landscape, a shallow well permit must be obtained from the Building and Zoning Department, and the pump installation and design must meet the plumbing codes set forth by Southern Building Code Congress International and the laws of the state. If re-use water is available, then no shallow well is allowed.

Sec. 90-335. - Public notice.
After a completed application has been filed, the next step in the approval process for a zoning action required by this chapter is to set a date for a public hearing on the matter and render proper notice to the public. Proper public hearing notice procedures are as follows:
(A)
Legal notice. Notice of public meetings before the Planning and Zoning Board and public hearings before City Council as required by this section shall be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the City and shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also include the location of property that is the subject of the zoning action, the present zoning district of said property, and the proposed zoning district or proposed zoning action of said property. Such notice for the official public hearing before the City Council shall be published at least 15 days; but, not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing.
(B)
Signs posted. Where a zoning action of property is initiated, a designated official of the city shall post a sign at least 15 days prior to the City Council Public Hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property for which an application for a proposed zoning action has been submitted. The sign or signs will contain information as to the current zoning district, the proposed zoning district or zoning action, and the date, time and location of the public meetings before the Planning and Zoning Board and the public hearing before City Council.
(C)
Notification to adjacent property owners. At least seven days prior, but not more than 45 days before the date of the public hearing a notice setting forth the date, time and place for such public hearing shall be sent by mail to the applicant, the planning and zoning commission, and all owners of property located within 300 feet from the property being proposed for rezoning. The notice shall also include the location of the property, its present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. The names and addresses of owners of such properties to be notified shall be provided by the applicant as set forth herein; provided, however, where a map amendment is initiated by the Planning and Zoning Board such names and addresses of owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from property being proposed for rezoning shall be provided by the Building and Zoning Department. Failure of the Building and Zoning Department to send notices or failure of the property owner to receive notification shall not affect the validity of any zoning action. This procedure exists as a supplement to the legally required notification procedures.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-336. - Public hearing requirements.
Whenever a zoning action takes place, a hearing must be held before the public. When an applicant requires more than one zoning action or subdivision procedure for a development project, a separate Public Hearing must be held for each procedure or action. A public meeting is held by the Planning and Zoning Board and a public hearing is held before City Council. The public hearing before the City Council is by record the official public hearing. The purpose of each public hearing is to discuss information pertinent to the particular action or procedure. During the hearing the following rules and actions shall be followed:
(A)
General rules of conduct. Whenever a public hearing is required by this chapter or by state law prior to approving a zoning action, such public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)
The public hearing shall be called to order by the presiding officer.
(2)
The presiding officer shall explain the procedures to be followed in the conduct of the public hearing.
(3)
If the subject of the hearing is initiated by an applicant other than the City Council, the petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the applicant's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor or in opposition of the proposed zoning decision.
(4)
If the request is initiated by the City Council, all members of the City Council shall be allowed to speak as they are recognized by the mayor or presiding officer, regardless of whether such City Council member speaks in favor of or in opposition to the proposed zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor or in opposition of the proposed zoning decision.
(5)
When any person wishes to speak at a public hearing, he shall raise his hand and, after being recognized by the presiding officer, shall stand and give his name, address, and make any comment appropriate to the proposed zoning decision. If within two years immediately preceding the filing of the applicant's application for a zoning action, the speaker has made campaign contributions aggregating to more than $100.01 to any member of the City Council or any member of the City Planning and Zoning Board, it shall be the duty of the speaker to disclose the following information five days prior to the official public hearing:
a.
The name of the local government official to whom the campaign contribution or gift was made;
b.
The dollar amount of each campaign contribution made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the map amendment and the date of each contribution; and
c.
An enumeration and description of each gift having a value of $100.01 or more made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the zoning action.
(6)

(7)
A time limit may be imposed upon any person speaking at a public hearing, but all speakers are urged to make their comments brief and avoid repeating other comments.
(8)
The applicant shall have an opportunity, after all comments in opposition have been made, to make summary remarks concerning the proposed zoning decision.
(9)
Thereafter, the presiding officer shall announce that the public hearing for the requested zoning decision is closed, and the City Council or the Planning and Zoning Board, as the case may be, shall immediately and openly discuss the proposed zoning decision and vote on action which they are authorized to take.
(B)
Actions specific to the Planning and Zoning Board during a public meeting. In all zoning actions in the City of Rincon, the Planning and Zoning Board is a recommending body and all final decisions must be made by the City Council. However, the Planning and Zoning Board has an important role in the public hearing process. This role is as follows:
(1)
All proposed zoning actions shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board in a public meeting in accordance with the procedures set in this chapter.
(2)
The Planning and Zoning Board shall review and consider a recommendation to the City Council with respect to the application for a zoning action. The Planning and Zoning Board may decide to make no recommendation or it may make any of the following recommendations with respect to an application for a zoning action: approval, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, reduction of the land area for which the application is made, change of the zoning district requested, or imposition of zoning conditions; and
(3)
The Planning and Zoning Board shall submit its recommendation on a zoning action application to the City Council prior to the scheduled Public Hearing in which the City Council will consider the application for a zoning decision. If the Planning and Zoning Board fails to submit a recommendation prior to the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Board's recommendation shall be deemed one of approval.
(C)
Actions specific to the City Council during a public hearing.
(1)
Before taking action on a proposed amendment and after receipt of the Planning and Zoning Board recommendations and reports thereon, the City Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment at their next scheduled meeting.
(2)
So that the purpose of this zoning ordinance will be served and so that health, public safety and general welfare will be secured, the City Council may in its legislative discretion:
a.
Approve or deny the proposed zoning action as submitted;
b.
Reduce the land area for which the application is made;
c.
Change the zoning district to one other than that requested; or
d.
Add or delete zoning conditions as the City Council deems appropriate.
(3)
An action to defer a decision on the proposed amendment shall include a specific meeting date to which the proposed amendment is deferred. The City Council may also approve a withdrawal of an application, and if so stipulated by the City Council in its decision to approve withdrawal, the 12-month limitation on re-filing of the application for the same property shall not apply.
(D)
Public hearings records standards. The City Clerk or an agent of the City Clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the City Council for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning action's file.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-337. - Standards for conditional use permission.
Land uses listed in this chapter that are permitted as conditional uses must follow an administrative procedure prior to the issuance of any land development permit.
(A)
Review criteria. The Planning and Zoning Board shall hear and make recommendation upon such uses in a district that are permitted as conditional uses. The application to establish such use shall be approved by the City Council on a finding that:
(1)
The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this chapter,
(2)
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood or adversely affect the health and safety of residents and workers,
(3)
The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement acquainted with the use, noise or fumes generated by or as a result of the use, or type of physical activity associated with the land use,
(4)
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties,
(5)
The proposed use will be placed on a lot which is of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use,
(6)
The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted will be met, and
(7)
The action will not adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern.
(B)
Additional mitigation requirements. The Planning and Zoning Board may suggest and the City Council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (e.g., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.):
(1)
As may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community;
(2)
To protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and
(3)
To provide continuity and consistency in the character, architectural design, and physical layout of an area.
(C)
Adherence to requirements. Provided that wherever the City Council shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, noncompliance of any term, condition, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted, the City Council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
(D)
Permit longevity. Conditional use permission granted by the City Council shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by City Council.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-338. - Site plan approval.
The site plan approval process is intended to provide the general public, Planning and Zoning Board and City Council with information pertinent to how a new development will affect the surrounding area and the city as a whole. Site plan approval does not constitute approval of any other zoning action or permit.
(A)
Process. Upon submittal of the site plan, the Building and Zoning Department will review the site plan for noticeable discrepancies and determine if there is a need to apply for other zoning actions. The site plan is then forwarded to the City Engineer. Once the engineer has submitted comments to the Building and Zoning Department, the site plan shall be placed on the agenda of the next Planning and Zoning Board meeting. Until the applicant addresses all of staff's comments and the site plan is satisfactory, the City Council will not approve the plan. However, once the first public meeting is held before the Planning and Zoning Board, site plan approval may commence at any scheduled meeting of the City Council.
(B)
Zoning actions. Once a site plan has met the application and process requirements the necessary zoning action process may begin.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-339. - Variances.
(A)
Standards. After an application has been submitted to the Building and Zoning Department, reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board, and a public hearing has been held by the City Council, the City Council may grant a variance from the strict application of the provisions in this chapter only if at least two of the following findings are made:
(1)
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions beyond that of surrounding properties, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions, peculiar to the particular property,
(2)
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, the property cannot be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, without undue hardship to the property,
(3)
That granting the variance will not result in authorization of a use not otherwise permitted in the district in which the property is located or cause substantial detriment to the public good.
(B)
Height variances. For residential height variances the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to each side yard set back for each one foot above 50 feet in height and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors and any other fire protection equipment deemed necessary at the time by City Council. Where a rear yard abuts a side yard of the adjacent lot, the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to the rear setback for each foot above the 50 feet height, and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and any other fire protection deemed necessary at the time by City Council.
(C)
Permit longevity. After a variance has been granted by the City Council it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by City Council.
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-340. - Standards for zoning ordinance or map amendment.
In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Rincon against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards and any other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interest will be considered, when deemed appropriate, by the City Council in making any zoning decision:
(A)
Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area?
(B)
Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area?
(C)
Could traffic created by the proposed use or other uses permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards?
(D)
Will this request place irreversible limitations on the area as it is or on future plans for it?
(E)
Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested?
(F)
Will the proposed use substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the zone or neighborhood?
(G)
Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood?
(H)
Will the action adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of:
(1)
Environmental quality or livability resulting from the introduction of uses or activities which would create traffic, noise, odor or visual hazards or the reduction of light and air that is incompatible with the established development pattern.
(2)
Property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern.
(3)
Will the action create development opportunities of such increased intensity that stormwater runoff from the site cannot be controlled within previous limits, with [which] results in adverse impacts upon existing down-stream drainage problems or potential problems?
(I)
Will the action result in public service requirements such as provision of utilities or safety services which, because of the location or scale of the development, cannot be provided on an economic basis and therefore would create an actual burden to the public?
( Ord. of 8-23-10 )
Sec. 90-341. - Naming of streets without official authorization
