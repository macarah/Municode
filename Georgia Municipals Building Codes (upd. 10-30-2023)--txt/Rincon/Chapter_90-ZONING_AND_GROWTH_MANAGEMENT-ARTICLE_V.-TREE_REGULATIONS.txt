Sec. 90-143. - Findings of fact.
It is hereby found and determined that:
(1)
Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for survival of mankind;
(2)
Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing and environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air;
(3)
Trees play an important role in the hydrologic cycle, transpiring considerable amounts of water each day, thereby precipitating dust and other particulate airborne pollutants from the air;
(4)
Trees play an important role in neutralizing waste water which passes through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers;
(5)
Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the soil and play in important and effective part in city-wide soil conservation, erosion control and flood control;
(6)
Trees are an invaluable physical and psychological addition to the city, making life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling both air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the visual monotony of development on the land;
(7)
Trees provide wildlife habitat and play other important ecological roles;
(8)
The protection of trees within the City is not only desirable, but essential to the present and future health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens;
(9)
Some trees are more beneficial than others as necessary contributors to the City's environment and it is not necessary to protect each and every tree in order to attain the public benefit of a tree protection ordinance;
(10)
Trees have a useable life period and reach old age and die at various ages depending upon the severity of site stresses.

Sec. 90-161. - Storm damaged tree management.
The Tree Administrator or other designated staff member will assess damaged trees and prioritize public safety concerns by the tree damage classifications.
CONTINGENCY TABLE
Good storm damage management is the removal of fallen, heavily damaged, hazardous, and soon to be hazardous trees. Good storm damage management is much more cost effective over the long run than cleaning up fallen materials now and reacting to tree calls in the future. While equipment and personnel are available, treat all trees in need.
Storm damaged tree evaluations should be performed by a trained urban forester/arborist before or at the time of initial tree crew attack. Minimizing liability risks, protecting community assets (including trees), and/or better management of community asset appreciation are the primary reasons for any treatment.
Prioritize tree work by public safety concerns and tree damage class.

-major branch collapse (greater than 50% of live crown effected)
