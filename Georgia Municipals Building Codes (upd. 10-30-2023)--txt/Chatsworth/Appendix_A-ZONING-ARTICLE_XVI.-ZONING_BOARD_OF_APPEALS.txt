Variances: The Board shall hear and decide applications for variances from the development requirements of this Ordinance, but only where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, was a lot or plat of record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the said development requirements of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon the owner of such property. In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served. However, the Board shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited.
No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that all of the following conditions exist:
a.
That the special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to such premises and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity.
b.
That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not merely to serve as convenience to the applicant.
c.
That the condition from which relief of a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant.
d.
That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire, imperil the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding areas or in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort, morals, or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City.

b.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
c.
The appellant and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present evidence on matters before the Board.
