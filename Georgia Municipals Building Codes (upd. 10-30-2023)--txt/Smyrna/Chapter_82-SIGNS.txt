Sec. 82-1. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
In order to protect the public safety, including traffic safety, to assure aesthetic harmony and compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, and to provide for orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all its citizens, the governing authority finds that the improper control of signs would be detrimental to the common goals of the city. The governing authority thus determines that the public health, safety and welfare require the adoption of this chapter.
(b)
The governing authority finds that signs and advertising are proper and necessary uses of private property and can constitute a legitimate business entitled to the protection of the law. A sign by its very nature is designed to draw an individual's attention to that sign. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication; however, this same characteristic can distract motorists and pedestrians, thus creating traffic hazards.
(c)
The governing authority further finds that the clutter created by an excess in number, size and height of signs creates a distraction to travelers and negatively impacts the general appearance of an area. Signs may lessen the aesthetic qualities of an area and may intrude upon the residential character of an area, as well as property values.
(d)
The governing authority further finds that signs and advertising should be reasonably regulated in the interest of traffic safety, aesthetics and public welfare by the establishment of standards for the location, size, illumination, number, construction and maintenance of all signs and advertising structures in the city and to ensure that they are structurally safe and sound.
(e)
The governing authority recognizes that the City of Roswell and the City of Smyrna share in common many of the same characteristics. Both are located within the Atlanta Metropolitan area, and face the same challenges concerning traffic safety and aesthetics. Because of this, the governing authority looks to and incorporates the study conducted by the City of Roswell entitled The Public Purposes of Roswell's Sign Ordinance and the implications of doing without it, a position paper prepared by Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, Planning Director, as support for the governing authority's regulation and control of signs within the City of Smyrna. In addition to other evidence provided at the adoption of [the] chapter.

Three feet of letter height is permitted for every 100 feet of building frontage the store occupies within the center (i.e. 400 feet of building frontage would allow up to 12 feet in letter height) with a maximum height of 15 feet. Any fractional increases created by the above formula will not be considered and will be rounded down to the smaller number.
