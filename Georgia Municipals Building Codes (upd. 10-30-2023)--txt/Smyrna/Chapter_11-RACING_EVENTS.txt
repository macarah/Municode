Sec. 11-6. - General considerations regarding approval, denial, or revocation of a racing event permit.
In determining whether to approve a permit, including but not limited to the time, manner and place requested, whether to approve the permit with modifications as to time, manner and place, or whether to deny the permit altogether, the office of the city administrator and any other city representative evaluating the application, shall be guided by the following criteria:
(a)
The office of the assistant city administer shall issue a permit as provided for hereunder when, from a consideration of the application and from any other information as may otherwise be obtained, they find that:
(1)
The conduct of the racing event will not substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route;
(2)
The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly points of the racing event will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to the assembly areas;
(3)
The conduct of the racing event will not unreasonably interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment en route to a fire;
(4)
The racing event is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en route; and
(5)
The racing event is not to be held for the sole purpose of advertising any product, goods, or event, and is not designed to be held purely for private profit.
(b)
Non-discrimination. This provision shall apply to all aspects of permitting. Though certain sections of this chapter refer to this provision specifically, those references are for emphasis only, and do not imply that this provision does not apply to all other sections of the chapter.
(1)
No permit shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, manner, or place on account of the race, color, creed, religion, gender, domestic relationship status, parental status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation or gender identity of the applicant and/or the participants of the racing event.
(2)
No permit shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, manner, or place based upon the message of the racing event, the content of speech of the racing event, nor based on the identity or associational relationships of the applicant and/or participants.
(3)
No permit shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, manner, or place on account of any assumptions or predictions as to the amount of hostility which may be aroused in the public by the content of speech or message conveyed by the racing event, provided that reasonable accommodation as to time, manner and place may be required in order for the city to provide the resources necessary for police protection.
(c)
The assistant city administrator may deny or revoke a permit if an applicant has an outstanding debt with the city, or if the racing event is done on behalf of or in the name of a person, organization, corporation or other group that has an outstanding debt with the city, until such time as payment is received in full.
(d)
The assistant city administrator may deny or revoke a permit if an applicant has failed to complete payment of any sums required for a previously permitted racing event, until such time as payment is received. Said sums shall include, without limitation, the cost of supplemental services, and the cost of restoration services, including those restoration services described in subsections (e) and (f) below, arising from the past racing event. In the alternative, the assistant city administrator may condition the granting of a new permit on the payment of amounts in arrears in connection with the previous racing event. The assistant city administrator may not require the payment of arrears for previous racing events unless the assistant city administrator or her/his designee had mailed or delivered to the applicant a demand for such payment within 60 days after the ending date of such previous racing event.
(e)
The assistant city administrator may deny a permit to an applicant who has failed to substantially perform a cleanup plan which was made a condition of a previous permit, or who has defaulted on a previous bond in connection with a permitted racing event until such time as restitution is made in a manner and amount satisfactory to the assistant city administrator, or until a reasonable plan for correcting the past deficiency is agreed upon by the applicant and the assistant city administrator. This provision notwithstanding, the assistant city administrator shall not require the payment of arrears or restoration costs from previous racing events unless the assistant city administrator or their designee mailed or delivered to the host a demand for such payment or restitution within 60 days after the ending date of such previous racing event.
(f)
The assistant city administrator may deny a permit to an applicant who caused significant damage to city streets, sidewalks, parks, and/or other city real or personal property and, at the time of submitting an application for a new racing event, failed to adequately repair the damage or failed to pay a bill for restoration services in full, provided that the assistant city administrator or her/his designee mailed or delivered to the host a demand for such repair or restoration compensation within 60 days after the ending date of such previous racing event.
(g)
The assistant city administrator may deny or revoke a permit if the applicant has, in this city or in any other locality, violated a material condition and/or restriction of a racing event permit, or if the applicant's conduct regarding the racing event was in violation of law or local ordinance.
(h)
The assistant city administrator may modify, deny or revoke a permit when, due to the scope of the racing event, and the number of police personnel required to provide protection and traffic control for the racing event, and due to the need for police personnel elsewhere in the city, the racing event would require the diversion of such a number of police personnel that it will be more likely than not that normal police protection elsewhere in the city cannot be provided continuously and safely for the duration of the racing event.
(i)
The assistant city administrator may deny or revoke a permit at any time if it shall appear by competent evidence that the applicant has made a material misrepresentation or given incorrect material information on the application. Prior to such denial or revocation, the assistant city administrator shall notify the applicant of the evidence and provide the applicant with three business days in which to rebut said evidence in writing.

(l)
The assistant city administrator may revoke a racing event permit upon the applicant's violation of the rules set forth in this chapter after they have received the racing event permit.
(m)
