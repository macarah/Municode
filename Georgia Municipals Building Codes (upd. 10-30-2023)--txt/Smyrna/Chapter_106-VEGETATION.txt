Sec. 106-26. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The intention of this article is to promote the awareness of the benefits of trees as an integral part of the land development and construction process and to establish mechanisms which result in long term community viability. This article shall be known and may be cited as "The Smyrna Tree Ordinance."
(b)
Community forests are recognized for their important role in providing economic vitality and ecological viability for all real property. Trees contribute toward quality of life, visual quality of the city, and improved property values. Therefore:
(c)
The city deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees and to manage and grow the community forest. It is the city's intent to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. It is also the intent of these regulations that all applicable sites within the city maintain or obtain minimum tree density, as defined herein. Consistent with the expressed purpose of these regulations, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to protect and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. Each person shall be responsible for the normal care of trees located on its premises.
(d)
The purpose of this article is to:
(1)
Provide standards for the conservation and replacement of trees;
(2)
Provide standards for the protection of trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the city; and
(3)
Provide education to the community about the value and best management practices for community forest management.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)

Public tree means a tree located on city property including, but not limited to, city street rights-of-way, buildings, parks and cemeteries.
Qualified professional means an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist, an American Society of Consulting Arborists (ASCA) registered consulting arborist, or a registered forester.
Reasonable effort means including but not be limited to; alteration of building design, alternate location of building, parking area, water retention, drainage pipes, or relocation of utilities in an effort to conserve specimen trees.
Recompense means the replacement of trees or payment into the city-held tree bank for the removal of specimen trees or to meet minimum tree density requirements.
Replacement planting means the replacement of trees and landscape materials into the required landscape areas, as determined by appendix A of this Code, conditions of zoning approval, or the provisions of this article.
Responsible party means any individual, firm, principal, or other entity who is a signatory to a tree removal permit application or a land disturbance permit for development activity or any person or company caught in the act of tree removal without a city-issued permit, or who violates any other provision of this article.
Root plate means the area of the root zone comprised of pedestal roots, the zone of rapid taper and roots under compression, and the directional radius of which based upon the tree trunk diameter at 4½ feet above the ground. The root plate will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to ½ times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. Catastrophic failure of the tree could result if roots in this area are damaged of destroyed. Example: The root plate radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is ten feet.
Specimen tree or stand of trees means any tree or collective group of trees which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, type or condition. See section 106-30 for general criteria regarding specimen trees or stand of trees.
Street/streetscape tree means any overstory tree located or proposed to be located along a public right-of-way or private street. The actual location will be determined by the specific zoning district or overlay. In situations where there is limited planting space in the right-of-way and/or safety concerns, street trees may be located at the back of the sidewalk or within the landscape easement on private property at the discretion of the community development director. An understory tree may be planted as a street tree with the presence of overhead utilities by approval of the community development director.
Technical standards means the technical standards and best management practices for the city's community forest prepared in conjunction with this article and which, as they exist and may be amended from time to time shall be incorporated herein, and a copy of which shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk.

(2)
Any tree determined to be hazardous, dead, dying, or diseased according to ISA Standards shall not be considered a specimen tree.
(3)
A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. Requires approval from the community development director.
(4)
A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a prominent feature in a landscape project. Requires approval from the community development director.
(b)
Specimen tree stands: A contiguous grouping of four or more trees which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the community development director. Determination is based upon the following criteria:
(1)
A relatively mature, even-aged stand;
(2)
A stand with uniform species composition or of a rare or unusual nature; or
(3)
A stand of historical significance. Requires approval from the community development director.
(c)
All surveyed trees will be inspected by a qualified professional and those that qualify as specimen trees or specimen tree stands will be noted, located on the tree survey and the tree protection plan, and certified in writing as being of specimen quality prior to the issuance of any permit.
(d)
Existing specimen trees may count toward the minimum tree density requirements if no disturbance occurs within the specimen tree's root plate. A developer may encroach into the critical root zone of a specimen tree and have it count towards the minimum tree density requirements at the discretion of the community development director. The developer must provide the following information to the department of community development prior to seeking approval to encroach into the critical root zone:
(1)
A tree protection plan showing the type of encroachment, the amount of critical root zone disturbance and any other potential impacts;
(2)
A letter from a qualified professional reporting on the current health and structure of the tree; and
(3)

This plan may include, but not be limited to: root pruning, canopy pruning, support systems, soil amendments, soil aeration, soil fertility, insect treatments, disease treatments, monitoring, root irrigation, lightning protection and vine removal. The tree prescription plan shall be pre-paid in full prior to the issuance of a development permit. Proof of payment shall be submitted with the application for a development permit.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)
Sec. 106-31. - Minimum tree density requirements.
(a)
A basic condition of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 100 inches per acre. The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development for the issuance of a development permit or any tree removal. The intent and goal of these regulations is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites and that a significant amount of tree canopy coverage and pervious soil area is maintained throughout the city.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, all trees designated for replacement meeting the definition of specimen trees shall be replaced on an inch-for-inch basis with a maximum recompense of 50 inches per acre. All trees used to replace specimen trees shall have a minimum caliper of four inches for overstory trees, and three inches for understory trees. Any trees planted on site to recompense specimen trees shall not be counted towards the required tree density for the site. However, any street tree and/or parking lot tree planted after the minimum density for the site has been satisfied can be counted to recompense specimen trees.
The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be conserved, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this article, or by a combination of the two. All conserved specimen trees on-site will receive density credit of three times the dbh of the tree. All conserved specimen trees must be protected in accordance to section 106-40 of the Smyrna Tree Ordinance to receive density credit.
Minimum tree density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in the technical standards. The property owner shall be subject to the minimum tree density requirement set forth in this section. The property owner shall base the density calculation on the net site area, excluding the infrastructure improvements (roads, utility lines, detention ponds, etc.) and buffer zones. In no event shall a parking lot be considered an infrastructure improvement.
(b)
All single-family and/or duplex residential lots shall provide the following at time of certificate of occupancy: a minimum of 12 inches per lot with a ratio of not less than one overstory tree per three understory trees.
(c)
Trees listed on the undesirable and invasive tree species list found in the technical standards shall not be used to achieve density, recompense and/or screening requirements.
In addition, replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Density credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees.
No more than 30 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan. Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized by the community development director where in their opinion an exception is justified.
(d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to: alteration of building design alternate location of building, parking area, water retention, drainage pipes, or relocation of utilities.
(e)
Streetscape trees shall be required as part of the streetscape on either side of the front lot line in accordance with the provisions of this article. The developer must still meet the streetscape requirements if the minimum density for the site has been met. Streetscape tree establishment shall be done in accordance with the technical standards. Tree canopy cover must meet the following minimum requirements:
(1)
All developments shall have one overstory tree planted every 40 feet along all subdivision roads and cul-de-sac, inclusive of driveways and easements.
(2)
Where overhead utility lines exist, the developer shall plant one understory tree every 30 feet, and
(3)
Where feasible, existing healthy trees greater than six inches dbh on the site or lot shall be incorporated into the required streetscape.
(4)
Streetscape trees may be spaced at variable distances to conform to the site standards and minimum distances set forth in the technical standards, however they must be more or less evenly distributed across the front lot line.
(5)
Streetscape trees shall be planted in the right-of-way, as determined by the specific zoning district or overlay districts. In situations where there is limited planting space in the right-of-way or for safety concerns, streetscape trees may be located at the back of the sidewalk or within the landscape easement on private property at the discretion of the community development director. An understory tree may be planted as a streetscape tree with the presence of overhead utilities by approval of the community development director.
(6)
Streetscape trees shall not be allowed in traffic vision clearance zones according to the technical standards or as designated by the community development director.
(7)
Streetscape trees shall be horticulturally appropriate for use in road frontage areas. Other species may be used as street trees with approval from the community development director.
(8)
Streetscape trees can be counted as part of the required density, but they may be an additional requirement if the 100 inches per acre is met elsewhere on site. Specimen tree recompense may be used to fulfill this requirement after the overall density for the site is satisfied.
(f)
Parking lot trees shall be required as part of the commercial developments within the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. The developer must meet the parking lot requirements if the minimum tree density for the site has been met. Parking lot tree establishment shall be done in accordance with the technical standards. Tree canopy cover must meet the following minimum requirements:
(1)
A sufficient number of trees must be planted in interior portions of parking lots so that every parking space must be within 50 feet of the trunk of a tree to assure uniform distribution of trees throughout the parking area.
(2)
Any redevelopment project that results in the removal and replacement of 25 percent or more of an existing parking lot (other than routine maintenance of the parking surface) must retrofit the entire parking lot to meet the tree planting standards set forth in this section.
(3)
Light poles are not permitted in parking lot islands, peninsulas and medians unless a lighting plan is submitted for review and approval by the community development director.
(4)
All landscape easements between parking lots and public rights-of-ways shall be planted with one tree for each 40 linear feet exclusive of driveways, access ways and sight distance triangles.
(5)
Trees planted to meet the parking lot and street yard requirements must meet or exceed the minimum standards specified in the technical standards.
(6)
Parking lot or landscape easement trees can be counted as part of the required density, but they may be an additional requirement if the 100 inches per acre is met elsewhere on site. Specimen tree recompense may be used to fulfill this requirement only after minimum tree density for the site has been satisfied. A tree may be planted to satisfy both parking lot and landscape easement requirements.
(g)
Boundary trees are offsite trees and shall not be used to achieve density, recompense and/or screening requirements.
(h)
Existing non-specimen trees may not be counted toward the minimum tree density requirements if land disturbance occurs within the tree's root plate. These trees shall be considered hazard trees and shall be removed from the site prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, including the removal of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)
Sec. 106-32. - Alternative compliance to tree density requirements.
(a)
The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide some alternatives in such case, two methods of compliance, at the discretion of the community development director, may be acceptable:
(1)
Planting at a location remote from the project site or
(2)
Making donations to the city tree bank.
(b)
The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods. The community development director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall 100 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question.
(c)
No development permit shall be issued until the community development director has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds. If trees are to be planted at another location, a tree replacement plan, meeting all applicable standards, must be reviewed and approved. The following note must be shown on the approved plan:
"A tree replacement plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the Community Development Director at least 30 days prior to requesting a final inspection. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the tree density deficit shown. Release of this project is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of the trees."
(d)
City tree bank. As another method of alternative compliance, the city will accept donations to the city tree bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of maintenance, education, and planting trees on public property within the city (see section 106-50).
(e)
Fund administration. The city tree bank will be administered by the community development director. A quarterly report shall be submitted to the city administrator showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)

Activities associated with future development shall include (but not be limited to): tree cutting, land clearing, grading and/or grubbing.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)
Sec. 106-34. - Tree survey plan and inventory.
(a)
The tree survey plan shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan prepared and sealed by a state registered surveyor or a state registered landscape architect noting the location of all specimen trees, boundary trees and all other trees which will be conserved and counted toward meeting site density requirements.
(b)
All specimen trees and boundary trees with their root plate and critical root zones are to be field tagged with aluminum tags and verified by a qualified professional and must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. This includes those specimen trees that are to be conserved as well as those proposed for removal. Specimen-sized trees must be assessed by a qualified professional for specimen condition. A copy of the arborist's report detailing the specimen condition of each specimen-sized tree must be included on the plan; letter-sized reports stapled to the plan will not be accepted.
(c)
All other trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. Only trees with a dbh measurement of six inches or greater are to be identified as eligible for density compliance purposes.
(d)
All trees six inches or less that are proposed for removal, and thus cannot be counted toward density requirements, are not required to be counted and shown individually on the plan.
(e)
Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas over five acres. The minimum sampling area shall be one acre. The sampling method must be approved by the community development director.
(Ord. No. 2019-19 , 12-16-19)
Sec. 106-35. - Tree survey inspection.
Following the receipt of the completed tree removal application, tree survey plan, tree protection plan, tree replacement plan, or required tree care prescription, and supporting data, the department of community development shall schedule and conduct an inspection of the proposed development site within ten business days. Upon request, the applicant or his designee may be given an opportunity to participate in the site inspection.

c.
The developer or project landscape architect shall also submit a photographic record and an assessment completed by a qualified professional of the boundary tree to the community development department prior to the issuance of a development permit. This documentation will serve as a baseline for the determination as to whether the boundary tree has failed to survive or is in a state of irreversible decline due to the permitted activity;
d.
Prior to the issuance of a development permit, the developer will be required to provide the tree protection measures required for specimen trees in subsection 106-40(b)(1) during construction. These tree protection measures shall only be limited to the property to which the development permit was issued; and
e.
Notice shall be provided to the property owner whose property contains the boundary tree. The notice shall include notice of the bond or letter of credit and a copy of the boundary tree provisions of this article.
f.
At any time prior to a determination authorizing the release of the bond or letter of credit to the applicant pursuant to subsection (g) below, if the property owner whose property contains the boundary tree ("petitioner") contends that the permitted activity has caused the boundary tree to fail to survive or be in a state of irreversible decline, the petitioner may petition the community development director for the bond or letter of credit to be utilized for the removal and replacement of the boundary tree. Upon receipt of such petition, notice of the petition shall be provided to the applicant hereunder at the address provided at the time of the development permit application, or at any alternative address subsequently designated by the applicant to the community development director in writing, via first class and certified mail. Within 30 days of mailing of the notice, the community development director shall make a determination as to whether the boundary tree has failed to survive or is in a state of irreversible decline due to the permitted activity. Notice of the decision shall be provided to the petitioner and the applicant by certified and first-class mail as set forth above. Either party may appeal the community development director's determination pursuant to section 106-44 of this article. Should the community development director determine that the boundary tree failed to survive or is in a state of irreversible decline due to the permitted activity, and no appeal has been filed in a timely manner, or the applicant has fully exhausted his or her appellate rights, the bond or letter of credit shall be released to the petitioner to offset any costs incurred in removal and replacement of the boundary tree. The petitioner's rights pursuant to this section may not be exercised more than one time in any 18-month period.
g.
After five years from the date of the establishment of the bond or letter of credit, unless otherwise disbursed pursuant to subsection f. above, the applicant shall have the right to petition the community development director for the release of all bonds or letter of credit held by the community development department for the boundary tree. Should an applicant file a petition here under, notice of the applicant's petition shall be provided to the property owner whose property contains the boundary tree by first class and certified mail at the address of the property containing the boundary tree, and at the address set forth in the tax digest regarding the property. Within 30 days of mailing of the notice, the community development director shall make a determination as to whether the boundary tree has failed to survive or is in a state of irreversible decline due to the permitted activity. Notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant and the property owner by certified and first-class mail as set forth above. Either party may appeal the community development director's determination pursuant to section 106-44 of this article. Should the community development director determine that the boundary tree has not failed to survive or is not in a state of irreversible decline due to the permitted activity, and no appeal has been timely filed, or the property owner has fully exhausted his or her appellate rights, the bond or letter of credit shall be released to the applicant.
(c)
In addition to fencing (where active tree protection is required), each tree to be saved shall be marked at the diameter breast height (dbh) with surveyor's flagging ribbon with a permanent marker indicating the size and species of tree, or number of the tree which is cross-referenced by tree size and species on a chart on the tree survey plan. The flagging ribbon shall encompass the tree; slashing the tree bark and wedging the flagging ribbon into the bark damages the tree and is not acceptable and will incur a penalty as described herein.
(d)
