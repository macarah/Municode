To assure that land is developed in conformity with the comprehensive plan of the City of Smyrna, Georgia.
The intent of these regulations is to provide for the harmonious development of the city and to ensure a coordinated development pattern with adequate provisions for traffic, recreation, drainage, sewers and other technical elements of land subdivision. This control is necessary to assure the maximum return on private and governmental investments and at the same time afford the homeowner protection and assure the subdivider full consideration of his interests and responsibilities.

From and after the date of passage of this ordinance, the planning commission shall be the official platting authority, and no plat of land subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Cobb County unless it first shall have the approval of both the mayor and council and the planning commission inscribed thereon. The filing or recording of a plat of a subdivision without the approval of the mayor and council and the planning commission, as required by this ordinance, is declared to be a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties indicated in article XIV of this ordinance.
Sec. 403. - Use of plat.
The transfer of, sale of, agreement to sell or negotiation to sell land by reference to, or exhibition of or other use of a plat of a subdivision of land that has not been given final approval by the mayor and council and the planning commission and has not been recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Cobb County is prohibited, and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document shall not exempt the transaction from the provisions of this ordinance.
Sec. 404. - Opening and improving public streets.
The mayor and council shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street or install any utility lines in any streets which had not attained the status of a public street prior to the effective date of this ordinance, unless such street corresponds to the street location shown on an approved subdivision plat or on an official street map adopted by the planning commission; provided, that the governing body may accept, lay out, open and improve any street not so platted if it first submits such proposed action to the planning commission for its review and comment.
Sec. 405. - Erection of buildings.
No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be erected on any lot in the city, unless in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance or unless such street had attained the status of a public street prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
Sec. 406. - Combinations and replats.
Where separate lots or parcels of land are proposed to be combined or replatted, such action shall be reviewed by the planning commission and, if found to result in the same number or fewer lots or parcels, final approval of such action by the planning commission shall be required. If, however, upon review the planning commission finds that such combination or replatting does result in the creation of a greater number of lots or parcels, such combination or replatting shall be subjected to the requirements of this ordinance and receive preliminary approval by the planning commission and final plat approval by the planning commission and the mayor and council before recording of such plat.

In subdivisions having access to or affecting any state or federally numbered highway, the approval of the Georgia department of transportation may be required by the planning commission.
When features of other plans adopted by the mayor and council (such as school or other public building sites, parks, or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part within a land subdivision, such features shall be dedicated by the subdivider to the appropriate public agency.
Sec. 705. - Large-scale developments.
The requirements of this ordinance may be modified in the case of a large-scale community or neighborhood unit, such as a housing project or shopping center, which is not divided into customary lots, blocks and streets, if the development is recommended by the planning commission and is approved by the mayor and council and if such development is in conformity with the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
Sec. 706. - General requirements for streets, easements and other public lands.
706.1. Continuation of existing streets. Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the width required by this ordinance (see Illustration 2).

706.7. Easements. Easements having a minimum width of 15 feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided where required for utility lines, storm drains and underground mains and cables. When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage right-of-way of adequate width, approved by the city engineer. Parallel streets may be required by the planning commission and the mayor and council in connection therewith.
706.8. Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs greater in length than 150 feet shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround of 50-foot radii of paved surface and 60-foot radii of right-of-way.

All pipe, valves, hydrants and other components shall conform to the city and health department specifications and regulations.
1102.2. Sanitary sewerage system. When, in the written opinion of the city engineer, public sanitary sewers are within reasonable distance and access to the subdivision, the subdivider shall provide sanitary sewer services to each lot within the bounds of the subdivision. A formula may be developed by the city engineer to provide for a sharing of costs of other sewer facilities needed to serve the subdivision when certain of the required sewer facilities are necessary to serve other subdivisions located in the same drainage basin.
When, in the written opinion of the city engineer, a public sanitary sewer is not accessible, an alternate method of sewage disposal for each lot may be used when in compliance with health department standards and regulations.
If public sewerage is not available, but is expected to be available within a reasonable period of time after completion of the subdivision, an alternate method for sewage disposal for individual lots shall be required on an interim basis. In such instance, and at the discretion of the mayor and council, the developer may be required to construct a complete sanitary sewer system for the subdivision, including outfall lines, street sewers and service stubs to individual lots.
