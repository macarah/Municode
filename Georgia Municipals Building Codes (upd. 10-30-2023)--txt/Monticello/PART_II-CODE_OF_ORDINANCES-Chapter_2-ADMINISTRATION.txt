It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that the members of its governing authority be, and give the appearance of being independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist.

(1)

(4)

Upon receipt of a complaint, the mayor, or in the event the complaint regards the mayor, the mayor pro tem shall appoint three members of council, who, along with the city attorney, shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics.

In the event the complaint is found to state sufficient facts to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, The board shall be appointed as provided herein.
(Ord. No. 00-03-14-1, § 7, 3-14-00)

Secs. 2-162—2-180. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF CONDUCT FOR MAYOR AND COUNCIL

Sec. 2-181. - Conduct during meetings.
During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, members of the Monticello Council shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the mayor;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the mayor, if he is ruled out of order by the mayor;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ______________?" or "Do you remember telling me __________?"" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ____________," or "Why did you tell me ___________ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a council meeting is to allow each council member, city representative and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive session.
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a city employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a city employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse city employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. City employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrong-doing by a council member during the public portions of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a council member during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive session.
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the positions or beliefs of the mayor and council as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a council member shall not state that the council will or will not do something, nor shall a council member state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single council member can speak on behalf of the council unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so.
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the council. By way of example, a council member is free to state that he does or does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a council member shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the mayor and council, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
(Ord. No. 08-07-08-1, § I, 7-8-08)
Sec. 2-182. - Conduct outside of meetings.
A member of the Monticello Council shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or city employee to do a job or to perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the city manager. Once such a request is made, the mayor and council shall follow up with the city manager regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or the city employee whom the council member expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the city manager first; if the council member is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the mayor and council in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any city employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any city employee. No single council member has the authority to hire or fire city personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any city employee. If a council member believes a city employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the city manager. If a council member believes the city manager should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the mayor and council. No single council member has the authority to discipline city personnel.
(4)
Use of profanity, insulting or demanding words about a city employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of other city employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a city employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other city employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in Section II, Rule I, above.
(6)
Demand that the city managers or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the council member's business. If the city manager or department head requests that the council member schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the council member shall honor that request.
(7)
Promise on behalf of the city or the mayor and council to undertake any act, or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single council member has no authority to bind the mayor and council.
(8)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the city without advance approval by a majority vote of the mayor and council.
(9)
Attempt to negotiate city business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advanced approval of a majority of the mayor and council. By way of example, it is permissible for any council member to discuss city business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Monticello by the parties involved). However, a council member shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the city unless that council member has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the mayor and council. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a council member's district is of no consequence, as a council member has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(10)
Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the city council without advance approval by a majority vote of the mayor and council. By way of example, a council member is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the mayor and council or in the name of Monticello unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 08-07-08-1, § II, 7-8-08)
Sec. 2-183. - Penalties.
The mayor and council shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this article. Any council member shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of the ordinance to the attention of the full council. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the mayor and council present. If the council determines by majority vote that a violation of this article has occurred, the council shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending council member:
(1)
A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration;
(2)
A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
(3)
Removal of the council member from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending council member is in involved in his capacity as a member of the mayor and council; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the mayor and council, to the head of such committee, association, or group, stating that the offending council member is no longer authorized to represent Monticello on said committee. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offence;
(4)
A fine not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending council member to the general fund of Monticello, Georgia within ten days of the mayor and council's vote establishing a violation; if the offending council member fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending council member's compensation as a council member.
The decision of the Monticello Mayor and Council on any question concerning a violation of this article, or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being intent of all the council member to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.
