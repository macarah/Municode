(Code 1977, § 11½-2; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005; Ord. No. O21-14 , § 1, 5-18-2021)
Sec. 2-116. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
The proper government and administration of the city requires that:
(1)
Its officials, employees, appointees, and volunteers conducting official city business including those appointed by city commissioner such as commission and authority members:
a.
Serve others and not themselves;
b.
Be independent, impartial and responsible;
c.
Use resources with efficiency and economy;
d.
Treat all people fairly;
e.
Use the power of their position for the well-being of their constituents; and
f.
Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity;
(2)
Governmental policies and decisions are made in the proper channels of the government structure;
(3)
Public office and employment not be used for undue personal gain; and
(4)
The citizens of the city have confidence in the integrity of their government.
(b)
Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of city officials and employees, the public interest mandates that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of its officials and employees in situations in which a conflict may exist or appear to exist.
(c)
Yet it is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this article must be understood and interpreted in a way that will not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire to seek public office by those best qualified to serve. To that end, officials and employees should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests except when a conflict would necessarily result.
(d)
The policy and purpose of this article, therefore, is to clarify those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the officials and employees of the city in the discharge of their public duties and to foster the development and maintenance of a tradition of responsible and effective public service.
(Code 1977, § 11½-1; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005)
Sec. 2-117. - Impartiality.
No official or employee shall by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person improperly can influence such official or employee or unduly enjoy such official's or employee's favor in the performance of official acts or actions, or that such official or employee is affected unduly by kinship, rank, position or association with any person.
(Code 1977, § 11½-5; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005)
Sec. 2-118. - Conflict of interest.
No elected official, appointed officer, or employee of the city or any agency or political entity to which this Code applies shall knowingly engage in any business or transaction or have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or which would tend to impair the independent judgment or action in the performance of official duties.
(Code 1977, § 11½-7; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005)
Sec. 2-119. - Abstention.

Sec. 2-120. - Gifts and favors.
(a)
No official or employee shall accept any gift, loan, reward, favor or services that may reasonably tend to improperly influence him in the discharge of their official duties. This limitation is not intended to prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value, which are distributed generally, nor to prohibit officials or employees from accepting loans from regular lending institutions. It is particularly important that employees and officials guard against relationships, which might be construed as, or give the appearance of favoritism, coercion, unfair advantage or collusion (O.C.G.A. § 16-10-2).
(b)
Nothing in this article shall prohibit any official or employee from accepting a gift on behalf of the city, provided that the person accepting the gift shall promptly report the receipt of such gift to the city commissioner, which shall have the gift added to the inventory of the property of the city.

Sec. 2-123. - Representation.

Neither shall any official or employee receive compensation for any services rendered on behalf of any person in relation to any case, proceeding or application before a city agency with respect to which such official or employee was directly concerned; or in which he has personally participated during the period of his service or employment, or which was under his active consideration or with respect to which knowledge or information was made available to him during the period of service or employment. However, a member of the city commission may appear before city agencies on behalf of his constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations.

(Code 1977, § 11½-11; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005)
Sec. 2-125. - Public contracts.

(2)
The borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution, which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan;
(3)
Contracts entered into in accordance with the O.C.G.A. § 16-10-6;
(4)
Contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency provided that a written record explaining the emergency is inserted by the mayor into the city commissioner minutes as soon as is practicable but no later than 15 days after the contract is entered into.
(5)
Contracts entered into with an official or employee, or with a business in which the official or employee has an interest, provided that such contract is:
a.
Awarded through a process of public notice and competitive bid;
b.
Disclosure of the nature of such member's interest is made prior to the time a bid is submitted; and
c.
After this section is complied with, a waiver of the prohibition contemplated by this section is issued by the city manager.

(O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.) shall be prohibited from participating in the zoning matter in which such official or employee has a direct or indirect interest. A violation of the aforesaid provisions of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated shall also constitute a violation of this article.

Sec. 2-127. - Preacquisition of interest.

DIVISION 2. - ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

Sec. 2-165. - Constituting the board.
(a)
The board of ethics of the city is hereby created and authorized by the mayor and city commission.
(b)
The board of ethics shall be composed of five residents of the city to be appointed as provided in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section. Each member of the board of ethics shall have been a resident of the city for at least one year immediately preceding the date of taking office and shall remain a resident of the city while serving as a member of the board of ethics. No person shall serve on the board of ethics who is less than 18 years of age, who holds public elective office, who is physically or mentally unable to discharge the duties of a member of the board of ethics, or who is not qualified to be a registered voter in the city of Waycross. No person shall serve as a member of the board of ethics if the person has, or has had within the preceding one-year period, any interest in any contract, transaction, or official action of the city. No person shall serve on the board of ethics who has been convicted of a felony in this state or any other state, or the United States, unless such person's civil rights have been restored and at least ten years have elapsed from the date of the completion of the sentence without a subsequent conviction of another felony.
(c)
The mayor and commissioners shall each designate two qualified citizens to provide a pool of 12 individuals who have consented to serve as a member of such board of ethics. These individuals must agree to undergo a criminal background check conducted by the police department prior to designation, and/or redesignation, the results of which will be forwarded to the mayor and commission. These individuals should be available to be called upon for a period of two years to serve in the event a board of ethics is appointed with the first designated and qualified citizens serving until December 31, 2022. The mayor and commissioners shall thereafter designate or re-designate individuals to serve in the pool in January of each year at the conclusion of each pool member's two-year term. Pool members can be reappointed and there shall be no term limits for the pool members since future members of commission may wish to appoint the same pool members. The city clerk shall maintain a list of the 12 qualified individuals. If a member of the pool does not finish their term due to refusing to agree to a criminal background check, becoming disqualified to serve or requests to be removed, the commissioner who designated the original member shall put forward a new designee to fill the remaining pool term.
(Code 1977, § 11½-3(a); Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005; Ord. No. O21-14 , § 1, 5-13-2021)
Sec. 2-166. - Duties of board.
The constituted board of ethics shall have the following duties and powers:
(1)
To administer this article;
(2)
To receive, review, investigate, process, make determinations on, and hear complaints of violations of standards required by this article;
(3)
To make such investigation and response to a complaint as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated any provisions of this article;
(4)
To hold such hearings and make such inquiries as deemed necessary to investigate and rule upon complaints;
(5)
Recommend any legislative or administrative action regarding the city's policies and practices which the board believes would or could enhance the ethical environment in which public servants work;
(6)
To report its findings and actions to the city commission;
(7)
All other duties and powers listed in section 2-167(f).
(Code 1977, § 11½-3(b); Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005)
Sec. 2-167. - Enforcement and administration.
(a)
Selection time. The constituted board of ethics shall be selected within 15 days after receipt of a complaint.
(b)
Complaints.
(1)
All complaints of ethical violations must be filed with the city clerk in writing, no later than 90 days after the alleged act occurred unless the complainant, by exercising reasonable diligence, failed to discover the alleged ethical violation within such 90-day period. In such a case, the complainant must file a written complaint with the city clerk not later than 90 days after the complainant discovered the alleged violation. In all such cases brought after 90 days from the date of the alleged ethical violation, the complainant bears the burden of convincing the board of the true date complainant learned of the alleged violation.
(2)
To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes, complaints will not be accepted against a person seeking election as a city official, whether currently serving as a city official or not, from the date qualifying opens for the elected office at issue through the date the election results for that office are certified. The time for filing complaints will not run during this period. Properly filed complaints will be accepted and processed after the election results have been certified.
(3)
In no event, shall an ethical charge be filed with the city clerk more than two years from the date of the alleged ethical violation.
(4)
Constituting a hearing board. All complaints against an official or city employee shall be filed in writing and submitted to the city clerk. The city clerk shall immediately provide a copy of the complaint to the mayor, commission and city manager.
a.
During a public meeting of the mayor and commission after receipt of an ethics complaint, the city clerk shall place all 12 names of the pool members in a receptacle. The city clerk will then draw seven names from the 12 names in the receptacle. The first five pool members selected shall constitute the board for consideration of the matter at hand. The five pool members selected will choose one of their members to serve as chairperson. The last two names selected shall be alternates in the event that some of the chosen members cannot serve. Additional names may be drawn if selected pool members are unable to serve so that there are five members for the board plus two alternates.
b.
The city clerk shall notify the selected members of their appointment by telephone the following day and shall ask if there is any reason the member feels they cannot or should not (due to a conflict of interest) serve on the board concerning the particular complaint.
c.
After selection to the board of ethics, each selected pool member shall attend a training session on this article conducted by the city. During this training session, the selected members shall select on member to be its chairperson. The chairperson shall receive additional training regarding the procedures for conducting a hearing. City officials, even if the city official is the official charged in the complaint, may attend and observe the training session but may not make comments, ask questions or interact with the selected pool members.
d.
Pay and other staff support.
1.
The chairperson and members of the board of ethics shall serve without compensation. The governing authority of the city shall provide meeting space for the board of ethics. Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities.
2.
The city attorney is designated to be the legal advisor of the board, except that the city attorney is not authorized to represent the board in any legal action if doing so would create a conflict, which would prevent the city attorney from also representing the mayor, the city manager, or the governing body.
3.
The city clerk shall serve as the recording secretary to the board and shall provide such administrative services to the board as may be necessary.
(5)
The complainant may withdraw the complaint at any time in writing and filed with the city clerk.
(c)
Dismissal of frivolous complaints. Within 30 days of board selection, the board may perform one or more of the following:
(1)
Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, review the complaint to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. The board of ethics shall be empowered to collect evidence and information concerning any complaint and to add the findings and results of its investigation to the file containing such complaint;
(2)
Upon completion of its review and/or investigation of a complaint, the board at a public meeting may dismiss those complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or which fail to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. Provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in equity against the respondent government servant. A rejection shall prevent refiling of a complaint regarding the same subject and alleged perpetrator for the same offense within six months of the original complaint filing;
(3)
Admonish, formally reprimand and/or publicly censure any complaining party that files an unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or factually insufficient complaint; and
(4)
Hold a public hearing within 60 days after the selection of the board; or
(5)
Forward an order to the mayor, commission and city clerk as set out in subsection (f)(22) of this section.
(d)
Parties rights. At any hearing held by the board of ethics, the official, employee, or respondent who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the allegations at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation according to the procedures contained in subsection (f) of this section.
(e)
Advisory opinions. When any official, employee, or person appointed by the mayor or the commission has a doubt regarding the applicability of any provision of this article to a particular situation, or regarding the definition of its terms, he or she may apply in writing or verbally during a public meeting to the city attorney for an advisory opinion. The advisory opinion shall be written unless it is given verbally during a public meeting, and may be provided directly to the requestor of such opinion. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit a request for an informal opinion by any public servant from the city attorney regarding a potential conflict of interest. Neither a request for an informal opinion, nor the making of a statement concerning a potential conflict of interest made by a member of the governing body in the course of abstaining from voting shall create a presumption or inference that a public servant actually has a personal interest in the matter about which the opinion was requested.
(f)
Hearing procedures.
(1)
At the hearing, the conduct of the parties shall be dignified both on and off the record. Misconduct before the board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges, and the alleged misconduct of others who may have escaped discipline in the past shall serve as no defense. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the board. It should be recognized that the board will be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable but shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and assign such weight as may be warranted and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues. The board may decline to listen to numerous character witnesses or numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts.
(2)
The chairperson of the board of ethics shall conduct the hearing.
(3)
The hearing shall be recorded and the city clerk shall prepare a written summary of the hearing. The complainant and/or respondent may provide a court reporter at their expense for a verbatim transcript of the hearing, if so desired. The city clerk, or their designee, shall take minutes of the hearing, specifically including the name of the board members who make any motions, the board members who second any such motions, and the names of the individuals on the board and how each voted. This written report shall be presented to the mayor and city commission at the conclusion of the board's proceedings.
(4)
A quorum of the board shall be required to conduct the hearing. A quorum shall be defined as five members. If a member is unable to attend the hearing, the mayor shall designate one of the alternates to replace the member. The ethics board may, before the hearing and upon ten days' notice to all parties, approve regulations governing conduct of ethics board hearings so long as such regulations do not conflict with this article.
(5)
The person who filed the complaint ("complainant") shall present his or her case to the board first.
(6)
All documentary evidence which is anticipated to be submitted to the board at the hearing by either the respondent or the complainant, and the names, with telephone numbers, of all individuals expected to present testimony to the board on behalf of either the respondent or complainant, must be given to the city clerk at least ten days in advance of the hearing. This requirement shall not apply to evidence used solely for purposes of cross examination or rebuttal. The failure of a party to adhere to this rule shall preclude such party from tendering such evidence or individual's testimony at the hearing through any form. The respondent, complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such lists that are placed on file with the city clerk.
(7)
The board may compel the production of any document in the possession of the city and subject to Open Records Act and the testimony of any city employee except where the employee is the respondent. All evidence shall be presented to all parties pursuant to subsection (f)(6) of this section. Where the board compels any such document or testimony after a hearing has commenced a continuation shall be provided so that subsection (f)(6) of this section can be complied with.
(8)
Neither party shall have the right to require depositions of any individual, including the opposite party. The respondent and complainant shall have the right to obtain affidavits that may be submitted to the board for consideration provided that such affidavits were filed with the city clerk no less than 48 hours prior to the hearing, and that the name of the affiant is provided to the city clerk. Both the respondent, complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such affidavits, which are placed on file with the city clerk.
(9)
The complainant's evidence must prove that respondent is guilty of the offense charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred to as "preponderance of the evidence."
(10)
Each witness presented by the complainant, and including the complainant, shall be subject to cross examination by the individual accused of the ethical violation ("respondent") or such person's representative.
(11)
At the conclusion of the complainant's case, the respondent shall be entitled to move for dismissal based on insufficient evidence on the part of complainant's case. If respondent makes such a motion and the board, by majority vote, agrees to dismiss the complaint, the hearing shall be terminated at this point. If either the respondent fails to make such a motion, or, if the board decides by majority vote to overrule respondent's motion, the hearing shall continue. The board may also direct a decision in favor of the respondent upon the board's own initiative.
(12)
Respondent shall then be entitled to present his or her evidence to the board.
(13)
Respondent is not required to testify. The absence of respondent's testimony shall not be viewed by the board as an admission of any sort.
(14)
If respondent testifies, then respondent shall be subject to cross examination by complainant. All other witnesses who testify in the respondent's case shall be subject to cross examination by complainant.
(15)
All persons who testify before the board, shall be placed under oath, by either the chairperson or a person designated by the chairperson. The oath shall read substantially as follows:
"Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give in this matter (name matter) shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?"
(16)
At the conclusion of respondent's case, the complainant may offer rebuttal evidence only to those items presented in respondent's case. At the conclusion of complainant's rebuttal, respondent shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence only to those matters presented in complainant's rebuttal case.
(17)
During the course of testimony and at the conclusion of all the testimony and closure of all of the evidence, the board members may ask questions of any of the individuals who testified before the board.
(18)
At the conclusion of all questions by parties and board members, the chairperson shall end the hearing and permit the board to deliberate in private. If the board decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the board shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require either the complainant or respondent to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The board has no authority to continue the hearing past this 45-day deadline.
(19)
Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the board shall continue to deliberate in private. When deliberations are concluded, the chairperson shall call for a vote. The board may vote immediately after deliberations are concluded or they may continue the meeting for up to two weeks when a public vote must be taken. The board's first vote must be whether the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the board rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the board, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the board must make a second decision by majority vote. The second decision involves the form of penalty. The board shall have six options of penalty which include:
a.
No admonishment and no further action;
b.
A public reprimand and admonishment not to violate the ethics code in the future;
c.
Formal reprimand;
d.
Public censure;
e.
Recommendation for termination, resignation or recall; and
f.
Recommendation of prosecution in city court.
(20)
The complainant may withdraw his or her complaint at any time without the approval of the board.
(21)
If any question concerning the hearing procedures, which is not otherwise addressed in this article, the city attorney, or in his or her absence, the appointed legal advisor to the board shall resolve the procedural question. Such resolution shall be placed in writing by the city attorney or other legal advisor and given to both parties. Such resolution shall also be presented to the board for final approval and recommendation to amend this article by adding such procedure.
(22)
An order will be generated by the board and submitted to the mayor, commission and city clerk for inclusion in the minutes within five days of the completed hearing.
(g)
Appeals.
(1)
Any final decision by the board of ethics shall be reviewable by the city commission in a public meeting set for such purpose. The request for appeal shall be filed within ten days after the issuance of a final decision by the board of ethics with the city manager. The commission will be notified of the appeal at its next regular work session and shall set a date for a hearing to be held within 45 days of the work session at which the appeal date is set. The city manager or city clerk shall cause notice of the hearing to be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested or by such other means to ensure notice to the appellant (i.e., personal service), not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. At the hearing on the appeal, the appellant shall be permitted to argue his or her case before the mayor and commission, but shall not be permitted to present any further evidence, either documentary or testimony. The commission shall render its opinion by a public vote at the conclusion of the proceedings to:
a.
Affirm the decision of the board of ethics;
b.
Reverse the decision of the board of ethics and enter a decision of a less severe nature; or
c.
Remand the case to the board of ethics for further consideration.
(2)
An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court of Ware County within 30 days after the decision of the city commission. The filing of such application shall act as supersedeas. The review by the superior court shall be limited to an inquiry of whether there was any evidence before the board of ethics and city commission which supported the decision of the commission. Provided, however, no action of the city commission or board of ethics refusing or failing to take action pursuant to this code of ethics shall be reviewable by the superior court.
