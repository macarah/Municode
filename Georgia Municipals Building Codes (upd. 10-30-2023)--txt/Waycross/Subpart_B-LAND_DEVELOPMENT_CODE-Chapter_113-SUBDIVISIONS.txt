ARTICLE III. - PLAT PROCEDURE AND DATA

Sec. 113-108. - Preapplication procedure.
(a)
Prior to the filing of application for approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider should consult informally with the planning commission's staff in order to be fully advised of the objectives of the regulations and his obligations under them and to receive assistance in planning his subdivision. If the proposed subdivision is to involve individual sewage systems, the subdivider should also consult informally with the county health department. The object of such consultation is to fully explain to the subdivider the procedures for obtaining approval of his plat and the requirements upon which approval is contingent, in order that he might be spared needless expenditures in connection with an unacceptable plat.
(b)
After the initial consultation described in subsection (a) of this section, two copies of the plans and data specified in section 113-109 shall be submitted to the planning commission as part of the preapplication procedure. This step does not require formal application, fee, or filing of a plat.
(c)
The planning commission shall determine the plat location of any public sites or open spaces, or of any rights-of-way for connectors, arterials, or controlled access thoroughfares, for which it shall require reservation or dedication under section 113-145 or 113-140(j), respectively.
(d)
Within 20 days after receipt of all the prescribed preapplication plans and data, the office of the planning commission shall inform the subdivider that the plans and data submitted (or as modified) do or do not meet the objectives of this chapter and explain any lack of conformity therewith.
(Ord. of 7-7-1964, § II(A))
Sec. 113-109. - Plans and data for preapplication procedure.
Preapplication review of the proposed subdivision shall be based upon the following plans and information, which shall be submitted in the form specified by the planning commission:

(2)
A location map covering the tract proposed for subdivision and the surrounding area and depicting existing community facilities serving or influencing the proposed subdivision, to include the following information: location of the proposed subdivision; main traffic arteries and public transportation lines; shopping centers and such facilities as elementary and high schools, parks and playgrounds, railroad stations, airports, hospitals and churches; name of the subdivider, title, scale, north arrow and date.
(3)
A sketch plan which shall show in simple sketch form the proposed layout of streets, alleys, easements, lots and other features and which shall show streets and platting in immediately surrounding areas. The sketch plan may be a free hand pencil sketch made directly on a print of the boundary survey and shall include:
a.
Boundary lines, with bearings (may be magnetic) and distances along them and with reference to control points.
b.
Location and width of street rights-of-way.
c.

(Ord. of 7-7-1964, § II(B))
Sec. 113-110. - Procedure for approval of preliminary plat.
As the first step in the procedure for preliminary plat approval, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with the other material specified in section 113-111.
(1)
At least 20 days prior to the meeting of the planning commission at which it is to be initially considered, six copies of the preliminary plat and any required supplementary material shall be submitted, in accordance with the provisions of section 113-111, to the office of the planning commission with a written request for approval. A receipt for the filing fee required by section 113-27 shall also be included with the preliminary plat.
(2)
Copies of the preliminary plat shall be distributed by the staff of the planning commission to the county health department, the city (county) engineer, and the water department. Each of these agencies shall have ten days after receiving the preliminary plat to review it and shall communicate their findings to the planning commission.
(3)
Prior to approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat, the planning commission shall afford a hearing to the person of name and address designated on the plat to receive notice of such hearing and shall give notice of the hearing by registered mail to said address at least five days before the date fixed therefor, stating date, place, and time of such hearing.
(4)
The planning commission shall determine the plat location of any public sites or open spaces, or of any rights-of-way for connectors, arterials, or controlled access thoroughfares for which it shall require reservation or dedication, where this has not been done in the preapplication procedure.
(5)
Within 30 days of receipt of the preliminary plat with application for approval, the planning commission shall notify the city (county) of any streets and public sites or open spaces and the city (county) board of education of any school sites which the subdivider will be required to reserve for purchase in accordance with sections 113-140(j) and 113-145. The city (county) or city (county) board of education shall then have 30 days within which to reach an agreement with the subdivider on the price to be paid the subdivider for such streets, public sites or open spaces upon termination of the reservation. Should the city (county) or city (county) board of education be unable to agree, within the specified time, on the price to be paid for land to be reserved, the city (county) or city (county) board of education and the subdivider shall each select an appraiser and these two appraisers shall select a third; and the three appraisers shall by majority decision arrive at a fair price for the street, public site, or open space in question, as of the time of reservation. The expense of employing the three appraisers shall be shared equally by city (county) or city (county) board of education and the subdivider. This procedure shall in no way limit the city (county) or city (county) board of education in the application of eminent domain procedure under state law, nor deny the subdivider free access to the courts.
(6)
Within 30 days after submission of the preliminary plat, the planning commission shall give its approval, disapproval, or approval subject to listed modifications, in accordance with the findings of the agencies listed in subsection (2) of this section, relating to their areas of responsibility and as determined by the administrative regulations of each agency. Failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary plat within the 30 days shall be deemed approval of it, unless the applicant for approval has waived this requirement and consented to extension of such period.
(7)
The action of the planning commission shall be noted on each copy of the preliminary plat and copies returned to the subdivider, the county health department, the city (county) engineer, and the water department, with one copy retained by the planning commission.
(8)
Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it should be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, the approval of which depends upon the fulfillment of the site improvement and other requirements of this chapter.
(9)
The installation of site improvements is to proceed only in accordance with an approved preliminary plat and the required data submitted therewith. No street or alley grading shall be done upon land to be dedicated to the public use or which would cause a connection to be made to a public street or alley until:
a.
Acceptable plans and profiles have been submitted to the city (county) engineer; and
b.
A street construction permit has been issued by the city (county) engineer.
(10)
Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year, provided that this shall not apply to a preliminary plat of a subdivision within which improvements are to be installed in stages with a final plat for each stage. In such case, the planning commission will prepare a schedule indicating the time period allowed for the final plat of each stage, provided that the overall time limit for such a preliminary plat shall not exceed three years and may be as short as one year, at the discretion of the planning commission in consideration of the complexity of site improvement in the particular case and the number of stages involved. The planning commission may grant extensions of the time period within which the preliminary plat approval is effective, each such extension not to exceed a period of one year.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN STANDARDS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 113-140. - Streets and alleys.
(a)
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the major street plan or other street and highway plans approved by the planning commission and shall conform to applicable regulations of the state or local governments respectively.
(b)
Where a street is not shown in any street or highway plan approved by the planning commission, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall:
(1)
Be designed and located in proper relation to existing streets and shall provide, where appropriate, for the continuation or projection of existing streets; or
(2)
Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
(c)
The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall be so designed that adequate access is provided to adjacent unplatted areas by streets extended to the subdivision boundary where appropriate.
(d)
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed controlled access thoroughfare or arterial as shown on a street or highway plan approved by the planning commission, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, lots backing onto the thoroughfare or arterial with a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of the abutting properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. The nonaccess reservation shall be at least 15 feet in depth in addition to the normal lot depth requirement and shall be a part of the platted lots but shall have the following restrictive covenant to be filed with the plat:
"The nonaccess reservations as designated on the plat shall be reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures thereon is prohibited."
(e)
Where a subdivision abuts or contains a railroad right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, provided that where such street intersects a controlled access thoroughfare or arterial, the minimum distance from said railroad right-of-way shall not be less than 250 feet.
(f)
Each service street shall be so designed that use by through traffic will be discouraged.
(g)
Private streets and reserve strips controlling access to streets shall not be permitted except where control is placed with the city (county) under conditions approved by the planning commission.

Right-of-way for controlled access thoroughfares and arterials, as shown on the series of major street plan maps which have been approved by resolution of the city and county governing bodies, shall be reserved for purchase by the city (county) at fair market value for the entire width or the portion thereof lying within the subdivision, in accordance with subsection (i) of this section regarding right-of-way widths, the location of such right-of-way to be determined on the plat by the planning commission during the preapplication procedure, or the preliminary plat procedure, if the former has not been followed. Where there is an existing right-of-way abutting the subdivision of less width than that required, the planning commission may require reservation of such additional right-of-way width lying within the subdivision as it may determine, not to exceed the total right-of-way width which may be required under subsection (i) of this section.
(2)
Additional right-of-way width for connector streets shown on the series of major street plan maps which have been approved by resolution of the city and county governing bodies, over that required for service streets, shall be paid for as provided for under section 113-110(5), the location of such rights-of-way to be determined during review of preapplication data, or the preliminary plat procedure, if the former has not been submitted.
(3)
Right-of-way for all proposed service streets, marginal access streets, and alleys lying within the subdivision shall be offered for dedication to the city (county).
(4)

Rights-of-way for the turnarounds for such streets may be the same as roadway dimensions, with appropriate provision for reversion to adjoining property owners of any turn-around right-of-way in excess of required street right-of-way width upon extension of the street.
(q)
Streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named in the city's urban area shall bear the names of existing streets, and in no case shall the names of proposed streets which are not in alignment with named existing streets duplicate the names of existing streets, irrespective of the suffix, avenue, drive, court, road, street, etc. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission.
(r)
Alleys may be required to service lots used for business purposes, if appropriate.

(3)
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and
(4)
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
(b)
Block lengths shall not exceed 1,600 feet nor be less than 500 feet except where exceptional topography or other conditions peculiar to the site make such dimensions impracticable.
(c)
Pedestrian ways or cross walks not less than ten feet wide may be required at locations approved by the planning commission when deemed essential to provide adequate pedestrian access or circulation to schools, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities.
(Ord. of 7-7-1964, § III(C))
Sec. 113-143. - Lots.
(a)
Lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum depth of building setback from the street shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots shall be so dimensioned and proportioned as to provide adequate building sites and useable open space for the type buildings contemplated.
(b)
Every lot shall abut on a public street (excepting mobile home parks) for a distance not less than 30 feet.
(c)
Every lot shall conform to the width and area requirements of the city's zoning ordinance, except that:

The minimum distance between building setback line and street right-of-way line shall be no less than 30 feet, as applied to a residence with the principal entrance facing that street, and be no less than 15 feet as applied to the side of a residence not containing the principal entrance. The plat shall show a setback width of 30 feet or more, with suitable notation of the 15 foot minimum requirement for side streets.
(d)
Corner lots for residential use shall be at least 20 percent wider (at the building setback line) than other lots, except where interior lots are greater than 120 feet in width, in order to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
(e)
Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines where not impracticable in designing lots to meet the dimension and area requirements of this chapter.
(f)
Double frontage lots (lots bounded on opposite sides by streets) shall be prohibited except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from controlled access thoroughfares or arterials in accordance with the provisions of section 113-140(d) (which requires nonaccess easements) or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.

(Ord. of 7-7-1964, § III(D))
Sec. 113-144. - Large scale developments.
The requirements of this chapter with regard to lot, block, and street design may be modified in the case of a plan and program for a tract of at least ten acres to be subdivided and developed under the control of one person, corporation, association, or other entity as a residential neighborhood unit and which provides in its design for adequate vehicular and pedestrian circulation, light, air, open space, and service needs for its potential inhabitants, with adequate guarantee, in the form of restrictive deed covenants or otherwise, that the design will not be substantially altered in the future. Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission and shall be submitted to the city (county) for acceptance of offer of dedication, whether or not such plat is to be recorded; and no building permits shall be issued until such approval and acceptance have been given.
(Ord. of 7-7-1964, § III(E))
Sec. 113-145. - Public sites and open spaces.
(a)
Where features of the comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds or sites for other public building and open spaces, as approved by the city or county board of education, are located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, any portion of which lies within the city, the planning commission shall determine on the preapplication plan or the preliminary plat of the subdivision (according to the procedure being followed) the boundaries of the portions of such features included within the subdivision and shall provide for the acquisition of such public sites and open spaces according to the following provisions:
(1)
Where acquisition upon the approval of the final plat is possible, this is the recommended procedure.
(2)
Where acquisition is not immediately possible, the public sites and open spaces shall be reserved for a period of five years from the date of final plat approval, within which time the city or county board of education may purchase the public site or open space from the subdivider at the price previously agreed upon by the procedure specified in section 113-110(5). The subdivider shall be paid interest at the rate of six percent per annum on the amount as determined by section 113-110(5) for the sites being reserved, such interest to run for the period of time between approval of the final plat by the planning commission and termination of reservation. The reserved site should be platted in lots as part of the overall subdivision, so that in case it is not acquired, it can be efficiently used for building lots.
(b)
In case there is a need for public sites or open spaces not designated on the comprehensive plan, but which are considered essential by the planning commission, the planning commission shall attempt to arrange voluntary reservation of such sites with the subdivider. The time period of reservation would, in such a case, be determined by negotiation, and although the city (county) or city (county) board of education would be under no obligation to purchase, a price to be applied in the event of purchase shall be agreed upon within 60 days of application for preliminary plat approval. The reserved site should be platted in lots as part of the overall subdivision, so that in case it is not acquired, it can be efficiently used for building lots.
(c)
Due regard shall be shown to the preservation of all natural features, such as large trees, historical spots, lakes and ponds, and similar community assets, which if properly included in the overall design of the subdivision, will add attractiveness and value to the property.

(2)
Easements. Utility easements (section 113-141(a)) shall not be required in a mobile home park but shall be required in a mobile home subdivision.
(3)
Block. Limitations on the lengths of blocks shall not apply.
(4)
Lots
a.
Each mobile home lot shall have a minimum area of 2,000 square feet and a minimum width of 30 feet. Recreation areas provided for the common use of residents of the mobile home park or subdivision shall be permitted to reduce the minimum area of the mobile home lot by an area equal to the total area of the recreation areas divided by the total number of lots in the park or subdivision, such reduction not to exceed 300 square feet.

Secs. 113-148—113-177. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - GATED RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS
Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 113-178. - Purpose.
Consistent with the overarching goals of this chapter, this division is intended to allow for private street and/or gated developments as one type of residential development alternative to allow the city to expand housing types and promote smart residential subdivision growth within the city.
(Ord. No. 08-01, § I(A), 1-15-2008)
Sec. 113-179. - Jurisdiction.
The provisions of this division shall apply to the city, including, without limitation, portions of the city which lie in Pierce County, Georgia, and any portions which may be annexed hereafter, and further includes property which may lie in any other county of the state which is subsequently annexed into the city.
(Ord. No. 08-01, § I(B), 1-15-2008)
Secs. 113-180—113-199. - Reserved.
Subdivision II. - Standards

Sec. 113-200. - Applicability.
Unlike other developments in the city, a gated residential development, where a gate is placed at the outer periphery of the development in order to restrict access, may be allowed to have private streets that are not owned and maintained by the city. All gated residential developments must be developed in accordance with the regulations of this subdivision, other applicable regulations of this chapter, and the city's zoning ordinance.
(Ord. No. 08-01, § II(intro. ¶), 1-15-2008)
Sec. 113-201. - Entrances.
The design and layout of any gatehouse, entry gates, external fence, walls, and berms shall be located outside any public street right-of-way and shall be designed to blend in, to the greatest degree feasible, with the proposed development and be attractive to motorists and pedestrians from adjoining public streets. Gatehouses and entry gates shall be located outside any required buffer areas. Entry gates shall be set back sufficiently far from public street entrances to allow for stacking of at least three vehicles out of the public travel lanes.

(a)
Water. A subdivision any portion of which is located within 500 feet of a public water system approved by the county health department shall be connected therewith, provided that mains within that distance can adequately serve the subdivision. Mains shall be provided by the subdivider from point of connection with the public water system to the subdivision; and all mains and service connections necessary to properly serve the subdivision shall be provided and shall be of a size that will furnish at least 15 gallons per minute to each anticipated dwelling unit, the number of dwelling units to be determined by the planning commission based upon the number of parcels for single-family and multiple-family dwelling units indicated on preliminary plat data and upon zoning restrictions (if any), and that will furnish adequate quantity and pressure for fire protection within 1,000 feet of each anticipated dwelling unit. Water lines shall conform with accepted standards of good practice for municipal water systems and shall meet, as a minimum, the specifications of the city water department and the county health department. Where a subdivision is not within 500 feet of an approved public water supply, a community water system approved by the county health department and the city (county) engineer may be provided, in which case deed or plat covenants shall establish a perpetual maintenance organization of property owners so that there is reasonable assurance of proper maintenance; or else the subdivision may be designed for individual water systems, to be installed in accordance with the standards of the county health department.
(b)
Sewer. When the nearest boundary of the subdivision is located within 500 feet of public sewerage system, sanitary sewers shall be installed and connected with the public system provided that gravity flow is feasible. Mains shall be provided by the subdivider from point of connection with the public sanitary sewer to the subdivision and all mains and service connections necessary to properly serve the subdivision shall be provided. Mains shall be at least eight inches in diameter or of such larger size as may be determined by the city water department, provided that a six-inch main which is not over 400 feet in length may be permitted where topographic conditions prohibit further extension of the main; service connections shall be of four inch diameter. Where the subdivision is not within 500 feet of a public sewerage system, a community sewerage system of design approved by the county health department and the city (county) engineer may be provided, in which case deed or plat covenants shall establish a perpetual maintenance organization of property owners so that there is reasonable assurance of proper maintenance; or the subdivider may provide individual septic tanks and disposal fields, which shall meet the standards of the county health department and the city (county) engineer. The lots to contain individual septic tanks and disposal fields shall meet the minimum area requirements of section 113-143(c)(1) and (2) and may be required by the county health department to have larger areas where the results of percolation tests show that additional area is necessary.

Installation of utilities. After rough grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied to the street, all of the underground work (water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections) shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. Where the utility mains are off the pavement, the developer may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the roadway without breaking or weakening the existing pavement.
(d)
Distribution of utility cost.
(1)
The subdivider shall be responsible for providing and installing all water and sewer lines and connections, in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, and shall bear the entire expense subject to the following provisions relating to reimbursement by the city (county):
a.
For that part of a utility main adjacent or within his subdivision, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for that portion of the cost of the main in excess of the cost of a main of adequate size for his particular subdivision.
b.
For that part of a utility main which is not within or adjacent to the subdivision, the subdivider shall be reimbursed one-half the entire cost of the main.
(2)
In making reimbursement under the foregoing provisions, the city (county) may, upon approval by the subdivider, install utility lines and substitute charges for such installation as a part or all of its reimbursement, such installation to be the subject of an agreement executed by both parties and specifying the amount of such charges, as determined in accordance with standard rates established by the city water department for each utility and type of construction.
