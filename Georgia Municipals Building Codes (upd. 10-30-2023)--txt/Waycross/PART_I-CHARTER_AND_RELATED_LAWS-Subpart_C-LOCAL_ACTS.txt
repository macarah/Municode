There is hereby created a body corporate and politic to be known as the "Waycross and Ware County Development Authority" which shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the State of Georgia and a public corporation, and by that name, style and title said body may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, and complain and defend in all courts of law and equity. The authority shall consist of the president of the Waycross and Ware County Chamber of Commerce, ex officio, and eight other members who shall be residents of Ware County within or without the corporate limits of the City of Waycross, and not less than 30 years of age at the time of appointment. In making the nominations and appointments of members of the authority not more than one member should be selected from any one family, partnership, or other business organization. The members shall be selected in the following manner: Immediately after the approval of this Act, the directors of the Waycross and Ware County Chamber of Commerce shall select and nominate persons for appointment and submit eight or more names to the county and eight or more names to the city. From such lists of nominees the commission of the City of Waycross and the commissioners of Ware County each shall appoint four members of the authority. For the first appointments, the county and the city shall each appoint one person for one year, one for two years, one for three years, and one for four years. Thereafter, all terms and appointments, except in case of a vacancy, shall be for four years. In the event any vacancy occurs in the county group, the county shall fill by appointment such vacancy for the unexpired term. In the event a vacancy occurs in the city group, the city shall fill by appointment such vacancy for the unexpired term. In making any appointment for a vacancy or after the expiration of a term the city and the county shall request two nominations for each member to be appointed from the directors of the chamber of commerce. The governing authorities of the County of Ware and/or the City of Waycross may, in their discretion, request the directors of the chamber of commerce to submit additional names before making the first appointments or any subsequent appointment to the membership of the authority. If no nomination is made within ten days after such request, the appointment shall be made without any nomination. A member who has served a full four-year term shall not be eligible for reappointment until the lapse of one year after the expiration of his four-year term. The authority shall elect a chairman, a vice-chairman and a secretary-treasurer, or a secretary and a treasurer. Neither the secretary nor the treasurer shall be required to be a member of the authority. One city commissioner selected by the city commission and one county commissioner selected by the county commissioners shall be ex officio members of the authority. The members of this authority shall be entitled to no compensation. However, all members shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.
