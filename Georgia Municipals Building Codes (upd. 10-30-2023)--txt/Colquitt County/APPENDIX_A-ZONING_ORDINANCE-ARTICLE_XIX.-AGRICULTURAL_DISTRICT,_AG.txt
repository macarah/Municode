Section 19.07. - Standards for solar farms.
The purpose of this section is to provide standards for the installation, operation, and maintenance of solar farms to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and the standards set forth herein shall govern issuance of special use permits for solar farms. For the purposes of this section, a "solar farm" is a utility-scale commercial solar energy system of ten acres or more, the primary purpose of which is to generate energy for sale to public utilities. A "solar energy system" is a system or device, including components and subsystems required to convert solar energy into electric or thermal electric energy, including all equipment and accessory buildings. This section does not apply to solar energy systems of less than ten acres, used primarily for production of energy for residential, commercial or agricultural buildings or facilities on the premises.
1.
Standards for solar farms. All solar farms shall comply with the following standards:
a.
Solar farms shall be fenced in using a chain link fence with a height of at least six feet with anti-climb devices with three barbed wire line arms or otherwise acceptable to the county compliance department. Brightly colored signs no smaller than one foot by two feet shall be posted on the fence every 100 feet warning of danger and high voltage.
b.
Abutting residential properties shall be visually screened year-round from any solar farms to the reasonable satisfaction of the county compliance department through any one or a combination of planting or existing vegetation or fencing, all of which shall be at least six feet in height.
c.
Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the ground mounted solar photovoltaic installation and consistent with best practices for the preservation of natural areas or good husbandry of the land or forest.
d.
There shall be a minimum distance of four feet between solar panels and the top of any vegetation beneath them, measured from the pivot point for trackable panels.
e.
The names of the manufacturers, installers, facility owners, and facility operators, and their addresses and phone numbers shall be posted on the required fencing at each entrance of a solar farm.
f.
All electrical interconnection and distribution lines within a solar farm's boundaries, except for power lines that leave the project or are within the substation, shall be underground, unless the county compliance department grants a written exception due to severe environmental constraints.
g.
Lighting of a solar farm and its accessory structures shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation and shall be reasonably shielded from abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of a solar farm shall be directed downward and shall incorporate full cutoff fixtures to reduce light pollution.
h.
All solar farms shall comply with any other applicable requirements of this Code and Appendix A, Zoning, including, but not limited to, setback and height requirements.
i.
All solar farms shall have an entrance open to the normal operation of emergency, police and public service vehicles and personnel, and must be approved by the emergency management director for compliance with that office's general order for emergency personnel access.
j.
All solar farms shall have a written emergency response plan that shall be approved by the county's compliance department, sheriff's office, fire department, and emergency management office. Each solar farm shall update its emergency response plan no later than January 1 of each year with a copy provided to all departments and agencies named in this subsection. The emergency response plan shall include the following:
(1)
The phone number, email address, and street address for all manufacturers, installers, owners, and operators; and
(2)
The phone number, email address, and mailing address for a representative of the solar farm responsible for responding to public inquiries; and
(3)
The material safety data sheets that apply to any materials on the solar farm; and
(4)
The clearly marked means and instructions for shutting down the solar photovoltaic installation.
k.
Decommissioning shall be initiated upon any of the following conditions:
(1)
The land lease is not renewed and the facility owner does not otherwise have rights to use the land where the facility is located (if the facility owner is not the owner of the land).
(2)
The solar farm ceases to produce energy on a continuous basis for 180 consecutive days. A solar farm that ceases to produce energy on a continuous basis for 180 days shall be deemed abandoned unless the current responsible party (or parties) with ownership interest in the facility provides substantial evidence (updated every three months after 180 days of no energy production) to the county compliance department of the intent to maintain and reinstate the operation of the facility. Upon the compliance office's determination that the solar farm is abandoned, the owners and operators shall not be authorized to recommence operations until a new application and inspection have been completed. The 180-day period described in this subparagraph (2) shall be tolled if said cessation of energy production is caused by a mechanical failure, act of God, explosion or public enemy, provided that repairs have commenced within 180 days and are diligently carried on to completion.
l.
No later than 180 days after abandonment or closure, the owners and operators of a solar farm shall disconnect the interconnection for the electrical grid; remove the solar energy system, its equipment and panels, and any appurtenant structures; remove all graveled areas and access roads unless the owner of the land requests in writing for it to stay in place; restore the property to the approximate condition prior to the development of the solar farm, including re-vegetation of any cleared areas with warm-season grass native to the region, unless requested in writing by the land owner not to re-vegetate due to plans for agricultural planting. No later than 180 days after abandonment or closure, the owners or operators of any such solar farm shall provide written documentation acceptable to the county compliance department demonstrating that the solar panels and related equipment were properly disposed of in accordance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
m.
With regard to issuance of a special use permit, the county compliance department may, in its reasonable discretion, waive any of the above-listed conditions which are not reasonable considering the nature of the project and may add additional conditions or safeguards as needed for public health, safety, and welfare or to mitigate the impact of the solar farm on surrounding properties and uses. Violations of any such additional conditions or safeguards shall be a violation of this article.
n.
All the conditions and requirements in this section shall be of a continuing nature.
2.
Application for special use permit, fee, and revocation of permit.
a.
Before commencing construction, all developers or operators of solar farms shall submit an application for a solar farm special use permit on the form prescribed by the county compliance office and provide proof of compliance with all standards for solar farms outlined in this article.
