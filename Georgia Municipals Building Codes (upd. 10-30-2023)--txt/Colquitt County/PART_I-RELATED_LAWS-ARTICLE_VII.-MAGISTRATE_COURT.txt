--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1981 Ga. Laws, page 4846, which provides for a small claims court in the county. Ga. Const. (1983), art. VI, § X, ¶ 1(6), provides that small claims courts, among others, shall become and be classified as magistrate courts. The provisions of this article should be read and construed accordingly. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Such court shall have civil jurisdiction in all cases at law in which the principal amount of the demand or damages claimed or value of the property involved does not exceed $1,500.00, said jurisdiction to be county-wide and to be concurrent with the jurisdiction of any other court or courts now or hereafter established in Colquitt County; and such jurisdiction shall include the power to issue writs of garnishment and attachment and to foreclose chattel mortgages and other instruments passing or retaining title to personalty for the purpose of securing debt and, in addition to the powers herein specifically granted, also all the powers granted to justices of the peace by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia.
Sec. 2. - Judge; election.
(a)
The judge of the small claims court in Colquitt County who is serving on the effective date of this Act [article] shall serve until the expiration of his current term and until his successor is elected and qualified under subsection (b).
(b)
The judge of the Small Claims Court of Colquitt County shall be elected at the general election and shall serve for a period of four years and until his successor is elected and qualified. Any vacancy in said office shall be filled by appointment by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for the unexpired term.
(c)
The judge of the small claims court shall possess the same qualifications prescribed by law for the judges of the superior courts of this state.
Sec. 3. - Acting judge.
Whenever the judge of the Small Claims Court shall be unable, from absence, sickness, or other cause, to discharge any duty appertaining to his office, the judge of the superior court of the county or any judge of a city court located in said county, on application of an interested party or of the judge of the Small Claims Court who is unable to act, shall perform such duties, and hear and determine all such matters as may be submitted to him, and shall be substituted in all respects in the place and stead, and in the matter aforesaid, of the judge so unable to act.
Sec. 4. - Clerk generally.
(a)
Any duties herein prescribed to be performed by the clerk of a small claims court may be performed by the judge thereof, although the judge may appoint a person to act as clerk, said clerk to be compensated, if at all, from the fees herein authorized.
(b)
Any such clerk of such small claims court shall have authority to administer oaths and take acknowledgements as effectually as any notary public may do, and perform all ministerial duties as are required by the judge of such court; and, with approval of the judge, may prepare claims and form pleadings for litigants requesting such assistance, and may accept compensation therefor.
(c)
In the discretion of the judge and with his approval, the clerk of such small claims court shall be authorized to sign and issue process (and or notice) in all suits filed in said court and, also, to issue summonses of garnishment in appropriate cases; but such clerks may not issue criminal warrants.
Sec. 5. - Fees.
All fees collected by the judge as herein authorized, shall be retained by him as his sole remuneration.
Sec. 6. - Commencement of actions; service of process, notice.
(a)
Actions shall be commenced by the filing of a statement of claim, including the last known address of the defendant, in clear and concise form and free from technicalities. The plaintiff or his agent shall verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation in the form herein provided, or its equivalent, and shall affix his signature thereto. The judge or clerk may, at the request of any individual, prepare the statement of claim and other papers required to be filed in an action.
(b)
A copy of the verified statement, together with a notice of hearing in the form hereinafter prescribed, shall be served on the defendant, and such service shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction in the premises. Service of said notice shall be made only in the county by an officer or person authorized by law to serve process in superior courts; or by a duly qualified small claims court bailiff; or by registered or certified mail with a return receipt; or by any private individual not a party to or otherwise interested in the suit, especially appointed by the judge for that purpose.
(c)
When notice is to be served by registered or certified mail, the clerk or the judge shall enclose a copy of the statement of claim, verification and notice in an envelope addressed to the defendant at his last known address, prepay the postage from monies collected for that purpose, and mail the same forthwith, noting on the record the date and hour of mailing. When a receipt therefor is returned, the clerk or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice of claim, or otherwise file it as a part of the record in the case, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant.
(d)
When served by a private individual, as above provided, he shall make proof of service by affidavit, showing the time and place of such service on the defendant.
(e)
When served as provided, the actual cost of service shall be taxable as costs. The cost of service shall be advanced by the party demanding same in addition to the filing fee hereinafter provided, and shall be taxed as other costs.
(f)
The plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment by default, without further proof, upon failure of defendant to appear, when the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount; when the amount is unliquidated, plaintiff shall be required to present proof of his claim.
(g)
Said notice shall specify the day and hour of the hearing, which shall not be less than five nor more than fifteen days from the date of the service of said notice; provided, however, that where service is made by registered or certified mail the date of mailing shall be the date of service.
(h)
When service of process (or notice) in claim cases, or summons of garnishment in a garnishment action, is attempted by registered or certified mail as herein provided and a defendant or a garnishee refuses to accept delivery of same by or from a U.S. postal employee or U.S. mail carrier, and the envelope with process or summons is returned to the Court undelivered with notation by such postal employee or mail carrier that acceptance or delivery of same has been refused by the addressee, then the judge or the clerk of the court shall file and preserve such returned envelope, with process or summons contained therein, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant or upon the garnishee, as the case may be.
Sec. 7. - Docket.
(a)
A court docket shall be maintained in which shall be succinctly indicated every proceeding and ruling in each case; and a notation or memorandum of the fact, date and amount of a judgment may be indicated on the docket without formal entry thereof on original pleadings but, in case of an appeal, the judgment shall be otherwise written out, dated and signed by the judge.
(b)
The court docket and pleadings shall be open to inspection by litigants in the case or their attorneys at all reasonable times so as not to interfere with the orderly business of the court but, pending final judgment and closing of a case, the judge may in his discretion withhold from nonlitigants any and all information regarding matters in process of litigation or settlement.
Sec. 8. - Costs.
The plaintiff, when he files his claim, shall deposit with the court the sum of $11.50 in claim cases against a single defendant, and $5.00 for each additional defendant in claims against two or more joint defendants, which shall cover the costs of that proceeding up to and including the rendering of a judgment, except the costs of serving process or notices to defendants and summonsing witnesses and hearing sworn testimony when required; but the deposit of costs as filing fees in cases of attachment, garnishment, trover, statutory foreclosures on personalty, and replevin by possessory warrant, and in actions ex delicto or in tort, shall be $13.50; and, in all contested actions ex delicto, the judge shall be entitled to additional compensation of $15.00 for each hour or fraction thereof required in hearing such cases; and in all other matters (not specifically mentioned herein) the costs shall be the same as provided for justices of the peace; and, in all claim cases and illegalities instituted by third persons after levy or after garnishment, the costs shall be $13.50, to be deposited by the party instituting such action and finally taxed in the discretion of the court. If a party shall fail to pay accrued costs, the judge shall have the power to deny said party the right to file any new case while such costs remain unpaid, and likewise to deny any litigant to proceed further in the case pending, and the judge shall also have the power to issue executions in favor of the officers of the court for any unpaid costs and have same enforced by levy and sale, by garnishment, or both. The final award of court costs, as between litigants, shall be according to the discretion of the judge and shall be taxed in the case at his discretion.
Sec. 9. - Trial, pleading, procedure.
(a)
On the day set for the hearing, or such later time as the judge may set, the trial shall be had. Immediately prior to the trial of any case, the judge shall make an earnest effort to settle the controversy by conciliation. If the judge fails to induce the parties to settle their differences without a trial, he shall proceed with the hearing on the merits.
(b)
The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law, and all rules and regulations relating to pleading, practice and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to administer justice.
(c)
In cases of attachment, garnishment, and trover, the legal grounds thereof shall be as now or hereafter provided by law, and the pleading and practice in such cases shall be substantially the same as obtained in courts of justices of the peace; and no formal declaration in attachment shall be required.
(d)
If the plaintiff fails to appear, the case may be dismissed for want of prosecution, or defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, or order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice may dictate.
Sec. 10. - Counterclaims, third party claims.
(a)
If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff, the judge may require a statement of setoff to be filed, or same may be waived. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against such claim, the judge may in his discretion continue the case for such purpose. If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, he may use a part thereof to offset the claim of the plaintiff.
(b)
Whenever a claim affidavit and bond is filed by a third party claiming personal property that has been attached or levied upon under an attachment or execution issued from the small claims court, the levying officer shall forthwith return the same to said court and, unless the claimant (at the time he files his claim affidavit) makes written demand for a jury trial, the issues raised by such claim affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said small claims court, and the judge shall be entitled to seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) for every such claim case. The same practice and procedure shall apply in cases of illegality affidavits. The plaintiff in attachment or plaintiff in execution may make written demand for a trial by jury within five days after a claim affidavit and bond is filed with the levying officer. The party demanding such jury trial shall deposit with the court a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of such trial, including the summoning of prospective jurors and jury fees, the amount to be determined by the judge. The costs in such cases, including the costs of a jury trial, shall be finally taxed against the party cast in said proceeding.
Sec. 11. - Entry of judgment, executions.
(a)
When a judgment is to be rendered and the party against whom it is to be rendered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into the earnings and financial status of such party and shall have full discretionary power to stay the entry of judgment, and to stay execution, and to order partial payments in such amounts, over such periods, and upon such terms, as shall seem just under the circumstances and as will assure a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is finally and completely satisfied.
(b)
The judge of such small claims court shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby.
Sec. 12. - Rules; bailiffs; terms; garnishment.
(a)
The judge of the superior court of Colquitt County may from time to time make rules for a simple, inexpensive, and speedy procedure to effectuate the purposes of this Act [article] and shall have power to prescribe, modify and improve the forms to be used therein, from time to time, to ensure the proper administration of justice and to accomplish the purposes hereof.
(b)
The judge of such court shall have power to appoint one or more bailiffs of and for said small claims court, to act within and throughout the limits of the county, such bailiffs to serve at the pleasure of the judge and under his direction, and a person so appointed shall be known and designated as "Small Claims Court Bailiff" and have the powers and authority, and be subject to the penalties, of all lawful constables of the State of Georgia, including the power to serve any and all processes and writs issued from or by said small claims court, with power, also to make levies and conduct judicial sales, and account therefor, in the manner of lawful constables. All such bailiffs shall, within five days from their appointment as such, take and subscribe the oath of office as prescribed in Section 24-804 and give the bond prescribed in Section 24-811 of the Code of Georgia, and such bailiffs shall be subject to be ruled for failure of duty or malfeasance in office as are other lawful constables of this State.
(c)
Such small claims court having no designated terms at stated periods, but being always open for the transaction of business, the judge thereof shall, in each instance, set dates for hearings and trials in every kind of case and, also, designate the times when attachments and executions are returnable and, also, designate the time when each answer to a summons of garnishment shall be filed, but no garnishee may be required to file his answer sooner than ten days nor on a date later than ninety days after he is served with summons of garnishment, it being here intended that the maximum time limit for answering garnishments in the superior courts shall not apply to such small claims court. Whenever a garnishee shall fail to answer at the time so stated in the summons served upon him, unless the court in its discretion extends the time for filing, the judge may forthwith render judgment and issue an execution against the garnishee in favor of the plaintiff for the amount previously adjudged to be due the plaintiff by the original defendant, and also for costs in the garnishment proceeding, but no judgment shall be rendered against a garnishee before a final judgment shall have first been rendered against the defendant. In cases of garnishment of the wages of a defendant employee, and it appears to the judge that an undue hardship on the defendant would result from deducting from his wages the full amount authorized by law, the judge may, in his discretion, enter into an agreement with the garnishee employer for deducting from such wages a lesser amount than the law authorizes; and the judge may, in his discretion, enter into agreements with employers for extending the effectiveness of a garnishment beyond the time stated in the summons of garnishment and fixing the amounts, times and methods of making remittances, provided such agreements do not infringe upon the legal rights of other creditors.
(d)
A summons of garnishment may be served by the sheriff or his deputies, or by a lawful constable, or by a small claims court bailiff; or it may be served by registered or certified mail, provided such service by mail is evidenced by a properly signed return receipt, which receipt shall be attached to the original garnishment affidavit, or to the writ of attachment. Whenever served in person by a court officer as aforesaid, such officer shall enter his return of service either on the back of the original garnishment affidavit or the attachment writ or on the back of a conformed copy of the original summons of garnishment which was given to the garnishee, or such entry of service may be made on a separate paper and attached to the said garnishment affidavit or the writ of attachment, as the case may be.
(e)
The compensation of such small claims court bailiffs shall be such as may be allowed by the judge of said court but shall not exceed the compensation fixed by law for similar services performed by the sheriffs of this State and their deputies.
Editor's note— The Code sections cited in paragraph (b) of this section appear to be obsolete.
Sec. 13. - Jury trials.
(a)
Jury trials may be had upon demand of the plaintiff at the time of the commencement of his suit or by the defendant within five days after service of notice of suit by depositing with the judge or his clerk such sum as the judge may fix as reasonable to secure payment of cost incurred by reason of a jury trial. The judge or clerk shall have the power to subpoena jurymen, and witnesses, and to compel their attendance.
(b)
Unless otherwise demanded, such juries shall consist of six persons chosen from twelve veniremen, the plaintiff and defendant having three strikes each.
(c)
The judge of a small claims court shall have power to impose fines of not more than ten dollars or imprison for not longer than twenty-four hours any person guilty of a contempt of court, such fines to be paid into the county treasury or depository for county purposes.
Sec. 14. - Liens.
Judgments of said Small Claims Court shall become a lien on the real estate and personal property of a defendant, from the time of the filing in the office of the clerk of the superior court of said county, of an execution based upon such judgment and the entry thereof by the clerk in the general execution docket for said county.
Sec. 15. - Appeals generally.
Appeals may be had from judgments rendered in the small claims court to the superior court of the county at any time within four days (Sundays excluded) after the rendering of the judgment complained of, and upon the payment within that time of all accrued court costs, and upon the filing of an approved bond, with good and sufficient security, to pay all future costs of court, as well as to pay the eventual condemnation money, except that, in applicable cases when so determined by the judge, appeals may be taken in forma pauperis; but an appeal in forma pauperis shall not operate to stay the issuance and/or enforcement of an execution.
Sec. 16. - Forms.
Until otherwise provided by rules of court, the statement of claims, verification, and notice shall be in the following or equivalent form, and shall be in lieu of any forms now employed and of any form of summons and/or process now provided by law:
