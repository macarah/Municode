Editor's note— In the above section, the term "basic rates and charges" derives from the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 which, among other things, provides that the basic service tier rates and the charges for related equipment, installation and services of a cable television system shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission.
The term "FCC rate regulations" derives from the "Report and Order, In the Matter of Implementation of Sections of Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992: Rate Regulation," MM Docket 92-266, FCC 93-177 (released May 3, 1993).
