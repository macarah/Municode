ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 46-1. - Title.
This chapter shall constitute and be known as "Stormwater Utility and Environmental."
(Ord. No. 2014-16, Att., 11-3-14)
Sec. 46-2. - Purpose.
The City of Kennesaw, Georgia (the "city") is authorized by the State Constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law, to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the geographic area of the city which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the city. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The mayor and council has determined that development in the city to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city.
(Ord. No. 2014-16, Att., 11-3-14)
Sec. 46-3. - Findings.
The mayor and council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The city is authorized by the State Constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city.
(2)
The management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within the city is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of all residents and businesses in the city.
(3)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city.
(4)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(5)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(6)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies.
(7)
The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) (the "Act"), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act imposed by regulatory obligations of its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit require the city to reduce pollution in its stormwater discharge and increase water quality to the maximum extent practicable.
(8)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in the city.
(9)
The cost of operating and maintaining the City of Kennesaw stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(10)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(11)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the City of Kennesaw Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ II and III(a)(6).
(12)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city. Development in the city has altered the natural hydrology with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. Even areas of the city that remain less densely developed and rural in character with natural stormwater drainage predominating demand services along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, stormwater management services systems and facilities needs apply to all areas of the city.
(13)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefore renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city.
(14)
The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the long-term demands the properties owned impose on the city's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(15)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(16)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the city through stormwater service charges, utility fees and other mechanisms as described more fully herein.
(17)
A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city. Such service charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by mayor and council.
(18)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which significantly reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city.
(19)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and the city directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the City of Kennesaw stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be disbursed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(Ord. No. 2014-16, Att., 11-3-14)

Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of two-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., areas with slopes greater than 15 percent),
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns,
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas),
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors,
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff Quality/Reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted three months following the adoption of this article, the applicant may choose either: (A) runoff reduction, or (B) water quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after three months following the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the applicant shall choose: (A) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent: (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (b) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 46-36, the City of Kennesaw may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(6)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
(7)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(8)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(9)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the City of Kennesaw, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in section 46-47.

Sec. 46-220. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Kennesaw, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; moderate erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In additional, the wise management of forest wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is therefore necessary for the City of Kennesaw, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Kennesaw, Georgia. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, and aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Ord. No. 2014-16, Att., 11-3-14)
Sec. 46-221. - Wetland protection district.
This wetland article consists of: (1) the text of the model ordinance; and (2) a map showing the general location of local wetlands.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the City of Kennesaw, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter therein and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declare to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk.
(1)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required [for proposed activity]. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of Kennesaw and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(2)
Relationship to zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise on overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the City of Kennesaw Zoning Map, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this article by reference. When the two ordinances conflict, the more restrictive ordinance shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2014-16, Att., 11-3-14)
Sec. 46-222. - Local development permits.
(a)
Permit requirements. No regulated activity shall be permitted within the wetlands protection district without first obtaining a permit from the city. Said permit shall be obtained from the office of the director.
Should the proposed development activity be located within 50 feet of the established wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the director using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If such a determination is made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that wetlands are present on the proposed development site for which a regulated development activity is requested, a permit shall not be granted or issued until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and presented to the director.
(b)
Permit requirements within the wetland district setback. Prior to issuance of any development permit for activity within 25 feet of a wetland, the applicant must include, with the site plans the proposed action, documentation that the following post-development conditions will prevail at the site:
(1)
The rate of stormwater runoff, volume of stormwater runoff, and peak runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development levels.
(2)
The amount of the following pollutants carried within runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development conditions:
a.
Phosphorus;
b.
Nitrogen;
c.
Zinc;
d.
Lead.
In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TSS) shall not exceed pre-development levels.
(3)
In addition to other fees assessed, the applicant may be held liable for costs incurred by the city during evaluation of the performance standards.

If such owner or party in interest has no guardian or personal representative, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing which judge shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor, estate, or incompetent person or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person.

(c)
After such hearing, if the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any other parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing and order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
(3)
For purposes of this code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that the costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Chapter 39A, Title 43, qualified business contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement or the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city.
(d)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the building official may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated or closed or demolished. The building official shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(e)
If the building official has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The building official and mayor and city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(f)
The amount of the cost of demolition, alteration, or repair, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to the grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(g)
The lien provided for in section 46-503 and subsection (f) herein shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (g) of O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the building official shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Chapter 4, Title 48, provided however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after the imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(h)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this chapter unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(i)
The mayor and city council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timeable rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(j)
Review of the municipal court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
(k)
In addition to the procedures and remedies within this code section, the building official may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by the city, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in the municipal court prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this code section.
(l)
Nothing in this code section shall prevent the city from defining or declaring nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(m)
For purposes of this code section, "repair" shall mean altering or improving a dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring the structure in compliance with the applicable codes of the city and the cleaning or removal of any debris, trash, and other materials present accumulated which create a health or safety hazard in or about any dwelling, building or structure.
