ARTICLE VIII. - LC LOCAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-8-1. - Intent of district.
It is the intent of this section that the LC zoning district be developed and reserved for local or neighborhood oriented business purposes. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a stable, healthy and compatible environment for uses that are located so as to provide nearby residential areas with convenient shopping and service facilities, reduce traffic and parking congestion, avoid the development of "strip" business districts and to discourage industrial and other encroachment capable of adversely affecting the localized commercial character of the district.
