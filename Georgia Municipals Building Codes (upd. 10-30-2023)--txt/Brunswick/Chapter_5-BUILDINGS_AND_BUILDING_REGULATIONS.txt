ARTICLE IX. - SMOKING IN CITY BUILDINGS[9]

Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 956, adopted June 4, 2003, added new provisions to ch. 5 of the Code as art. II, §§ 5-21—5-35. As other provisions existed within the Code as art. II of ch. 5, the provisions of Ord. No. 956, §§ 5-21—5-35, have been redesignated as art. IX, §§ 5-251—5-265, at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 5-251. - Title.
This article shall be known as the city smoke-free air ordinance.
(Ord. No. 956, § 5-21, 6-4-2003)
Sec. 5-252. - Finding and intent.
(a)
The city board of commissioners does hereby find that:
(1)
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 (Monograph #10) that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 65,000 Americans annually.
(2)
The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen (U.S. DHHS, 2000, Citing Cal. EPA, 1997).
(3)
Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities and cancer.
(4)
The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability.
(5)
The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke.
(6)
A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled offices suffer a 25 to 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function.
(7)
Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for disease related to exposure to secondhand smoke.
(b)
Accordingly, the city board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this article are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public facilities in the city; and
(2)
To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.
(Ord. No. 956, § 5-22, 6-4-2003)
