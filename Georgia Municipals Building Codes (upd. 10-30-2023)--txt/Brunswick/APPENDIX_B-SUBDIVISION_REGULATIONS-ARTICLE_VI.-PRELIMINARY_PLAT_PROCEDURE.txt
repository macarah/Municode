  (Ord. No. 1055, § 4, 3-21-2018)
Section 606. - Effect of Tentative Approval of Preliminary Plat.
Approval of a preliminary plat by the Planning Commission constitutes tentative approval of the subdivision as to the character and intensity of development, general layout, and the appropriate dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned features. Such tentative approval binds the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of a final plat and the installation of site improvements, subject to obtaining other necessary permits.
Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat, and accordingly, does not authorize the sale of lots or the recording of a preliminary plat.
Section 607. - Revocation of Tentative Approval.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat or any time extension thereof, may be revoked upon written notice after due public notice and hearing by the Planning Commission, where the Planning Commission feels that a material change in conditions has occurred affecting the proposed subdivision, including new information regarding the physical conditions of the site or proposed public works, which would adversely affect to a substantial degree public health, safety or welfare.
Section 608. - Preliminary Plat Time Limitation.
A subdivider may, within one (1) year from the date of tentative approval of a preliminary plat, submit a formal application for the approval of a final plat, as specified in Section 700.
If a subdivider does not submit a final plat application within the one-year period and has not received an extension of time by the Planning Commission, as provided in Section 609, the tentative approval of the Planning Commission is voided.
Section 609. - Preliminary Plat Time Extension.
Before expiration of the allowed one-year period for filing a final plat application, a subdivider may request in writing an extension of time. Where the Planning Commission finds sufficient reason, it may grant one or more six-month extensions. The decision to grant an extension shall be communicated to the subdivider in writing on or before the original expiration date.
When the Planning Commission has granted an extension of time, it must, prior to the review of a final plat application, determine whether the conditions on which the tentative approval of a preliminary plat was based have been substantially changed and, if so, the Planning Commission shall require the necessary changes in the preliminary plat to reflect these changed conditions.
