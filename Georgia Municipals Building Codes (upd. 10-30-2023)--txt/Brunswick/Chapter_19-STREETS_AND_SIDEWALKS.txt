ARTICLE II. - ADDRESSING SYSTEM[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 948, § 1, adopted Mar. 6, 2002, deleted former art. II of this chapter and added new provisions as art. II as herein set out. Former art. II, §§ 19-36—19-42, pertained to house numbering and derived from the 1953 Code, §§ 33.38—33.44.

Sec. 19-36. - Title, scope, intent and administration.
(a)
Title. This article shall be entitled the "City of Brunswick Addressing Code."
(b)
Authority and scope This article is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Emergency Telephone Number "911" Service Act of 1977, at Section 120 et seq. of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as amended. All powers granted to the governing authority of the county by the statute are hereby incorporated by reference so as to be assumed, delegated and granted pursuant to this article.
(c)
Intent. The purpose of this article is to enhance the easy and rapid location of properties by law enforcement, fire, rescue, and emergency medical service personnel in the incorporated area of the city. It is found and declared by the city commission that establishing a physical addressing process will ensure that the new addresses will provide the best address information for the enhanced 9-1-1 database which can be used by emergency service providers, as well as by mail delivery services, utilities, delivery services, and others, for the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city.
(d)
Administration. The county GIS department is hereby authorized to and shall approve road names and assign numbers to all properties, and shall administer this article. The GIS department, fire department, and police department will coordinate the approval of road names. All requests shall be submitted to GIS. GIS will relay requests to the police and fire departments for approval. GIS will strive to provide address approval the same day unless a problem or concern exists. An example of a problem could consist of a road name request that already exists within the same ESN area. These problems or concerns will be submitted to the public safety committee for review and approval. Members of the public safety committee are the police chief, fire chief, heads of utilities and public works, or their designees. The public safety committee will make a determination within in five working days of receipt of the problem or concern from GIS. The decision of the public safety committee is final and binding on all parties.
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002)
Sec. 19-37. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated.
Addressing means the assigning of a numerical address and street name, which name shall be numerical, to each location within the incorporated area of the city and replaces any route and box numbers currently in place in the "911" database.
ESN means emergency service number, a geographic overlay defining different emergency service areas.
GIS means geographic information system, or its successor, presently a department of the county government, as established by the county board of commissioners.
Person means owner of a house, dwelling unit, or place of business.
Property means any lot on which a permanent structure or building has been erected or could be placed.
Road means any highway, road, street, avenue, lane, private way or easement, or similar paved, gravel, or dirt passage way.
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002)
Sec. 19-38. - Naming system.
All roads that serve two or more properties shall be named. A road name approved by the GIS department for addressing purposes which has been assigned to a private road shall not constitute or imply acceptance of the road as a public way and shall include the letters "P.E." after the name. Each P.E. (private easement) must be named. The following criteria shall govern the naming system:
(1)
No two roads shall be approved with the same name in the same ESN, except when the roads intersect perpendicularly to one another and the names are followed by different suffixes (e.g., Oak Road and Oak Lane). This exception shall only be granted if the road name does not currently exist elsewhere in the same ESN.
(2)
No two roads shall be approved with similar sounding names (e.g., Beach Street and Peach Street) unless they exist in a different ESN.
(3)
Existing duplicate road names will be changed unless roads are located in:
a.
Different geographic areas, such as the mainland of unincorporated Glynn County, St. Simon Island, and Sea Island; or
b.
Different emergency service number zones (ESN).
(4)
Existing duplicate roads will be renamed in the following order:
a.
Road impacting the larger number of residents shall maintain the existing name.
b.
Length of time road name has been in use.
(5)
The main entrance into a subdivision shall have the same name as the subdivision unless it constitutes a public safety issue.
(6)
Each road shall have the same name throughout its entire length in the incorporated area of the city. When a state highway has numerous names, the highway number will be used as the E-911 road name.
(7)
No two subdivisions, condominiums, apartment complexes, hotels/motels, or shopping centers within the same ESN will be approved with the same name.
(8)
Shopping centers shall have a road name assigned to the general primary public access drive of the shopping center. The road shall have the same name as the shopping center as approved by the GIS department.
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002)
Sec. 19-39. - Numbering system.
Assignment of address numbers shall be based on linear feet. In residential areas, address numbers shall be assigned every 60 feet along both sides of a road where possible. In commercial areas, address numbers shall be assigned every ten feet along both sides of a road where possible. The following criteria shall govern the numbering system:
(1)
Four-way and "T" type intersections shall be numbered in the same manner as residences.
(2)
Numbers shall be assigned from the point of beginning of each road. For dead end roads, numbering shall originate at the intersection of the adjacent road and terminate at the dead end road. From the point of beginning, address numbers shall be assigned even numbers on the right side and odd numbers on the left side of the road.
(3)
Numbering shall begin at the main entrance to subdivisions and trailer parks. All other roads shall be numbered from the southern beginning point and proceed in a northerly direction, or from the western beginning point and proceed in an easterly direction. From the point of beginning, address numbers shall be assigned even numbers on the right side and odd numbers on the left side of the road. If a "911" accurate addressing system is presently in place, then new address assignments or any changes shall follow the existing "911" addressing system.
(4)
The number assigned to each building shall be that of the numbered interval falling closest to the primary entrance. If the primary entrance cannot be seen from the street, then the number shall be that of the interval falling closest to the driveway of the building.
(5)
Every multi-residential building with separate entrances shall have a separate number. For example, duplexes will have two separate numbers; condominiums will each have a separate number.
(6)
Businesses, apartments and multi-tenant (three or more dwelling units) buildings shall have an address assigned to the primary entrance of the building. Apartment or suite numbers shall be assigned in ascending order from south to north or west to east end of the building.
(7)
Sequential addressing numbers shall be assigned on lots in approved subdivisions with restrictive covenants assuring only one dwelling structure per lot.
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002)
Sec. 19-40. - Designation of numbers and duty to display.
All persons, by the date set forth in section 19-42 herein, shall display and maintain in legible condition the assigned numbers in a conspicuous place, as follows:
(1)
Number on the building or residence. Where the building or residence is within 40 feet from the edge of the road right-of-way, the assigned number shall be displayed on the front of the building or residence near the primary entrance visible from the street or parking lot providing general public access. The same requirement applies to buildings, dwelling units, and place of business within apartments, condominiums, and nonresidential developments located on private streets.
(2)

Where the building or residence is over 40 feet from the edge of the road right-of-way, regardless whether the road is a private or public way or easement, the assigned number shall be displayed on a post, fence, wall, mailbox, or on some structure at the property line next to the walk or access drive to the building or residence.
(3)
Size and color of number. The standard number shall be not less than three inches in height for residential, or less than six inches in height for non-residential and multi-tenant buildings, and with a contrasting background. The numbers shall not be more than one inch apart or equal to the width of any number except the number "1". Numerals shall be maintained in a legible condition and shall be visible at night.
(4)
Temporary numbers. Each person constructing a building of any kind shall, during such construction, erect or post a temporary number, designated by "0" by the GIS department unless a permanent number can be assigned. This number shall not be smaller than five inches wide and 12 inches high and shall be posted not further than ten feet from the front of the lot upon which construction is being done. The number shall remain posted until a permanent number is assigned, erected or posted. This subsection (4) shall not apply to building permits issued for ancillary buildings that are accessory to the main building such as a separate vehicular garage, pool house or storage building. A temporary number will be assigned only when a permanent number cannot be assigned.
