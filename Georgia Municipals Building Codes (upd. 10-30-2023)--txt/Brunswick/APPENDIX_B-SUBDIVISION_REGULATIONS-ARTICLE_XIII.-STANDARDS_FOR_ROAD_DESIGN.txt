Service Drive or Alley—18 feet.
Section 1302. - Width Exceptions.
Additional right-of-way widths shall be provided when determined by the Planning Commission to be necessary for the following purposes:
(A)
Public safety and convenience;
(B)
Parking in commercial, industrial or high-density residential areas; and
(C)
Widening existing roads where the right-of-way does not meet the minimum requirements of Section 1300.
Section 1303. - Half or Partial Roads.
1303.1 New Roads. New half or partial roads are permitted only in the following instances:
(A)
Where the subdivider obtains agreement in writing from the adjoining property owner to dedicate and improve as required the other half of the road when the adjoining property is subdivided; and
(B)
Where essential to the reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards of these regulations; or
(C)
Where needed to complete existing half roads.
1303.2 Existing Roads. Where an existing road traverses or abuts the subdivision, the entire right-of-way required by these regulations, or as much as is possible within the subdivision, shall be provided. The right-of-way shall be measured from the centerline of the existing roadway.
Section 1304. - Cul-de-Sacs.
Cul-de-Sacs should not, in general exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable.
All cul-de-sacs shall be provided with a paved turn-around having a minimum diameter of eighty (80) feet to the outside edge of the pavement and one hundred (100) feet to the legal right-of-way line. Dead-end roads with no turn-around are not permitted.
Section 1305. - Road Elevation.
The minimum elevation of any road centerline shall be at least seven (7) feet above Mean Sea Level, based on the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Datum.
Section 1306. - Horizontal Curvature.
Where connecting right-of-way lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten (10°) degrees, the lines must be connected with a true, circular curve. The minimum radius of the centerline for a horizontal curve shall be as follows:
(A)
Major Arterial Road—573 feet (ten (10°) degrees);
(B)
Major Collector Road—573 feet;
(C)
Minor Local Road—150 feet; and
(D)
Other Minor Roads—100 feet.
Straight portions of roads must be tangent to the beginning or end of curves. Except for minor roads there must be a tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet between reverse curves. Between a horizontal curve and an intersection with another road or railroad, there shall be a tangent having a length of not less than sixty (60) feet.
Section 1307. - Sight Distances.
Proper sight distances must be provided with respect to both vertical and horizontal alignment. Measured along the centerline at a point six (6) feet above grade this sight distance shall be as follows:
(A)
Major Arterial Road—500 feet;
(B)
Major Collector Road—200 feet; and
(C)
Other minor Roads—100 feet.
Section 1308. - Intersections.
Intersections involving the junction of more than two roads are prohibited. Three-way intersections shall be used wherever possible in residential areas.
Right-angle intersections shall be used wherever practicable; however, in no instance shall the angle of intersection of the street centerline be less than seventy-five (75°) degrees.
Section 1309. - Intersection Curve Radii.
The design of a curb or an edge of pavement at an intersection should take into account such conditions as types of turning vehicles, likely speed of traffic, angle of turn, number of lanes, and whether parking is permitted or not. However, the radii of a curb or edge of pavement at an intersection shall not be less than the following:
(A)
Arterial with Arterial—25 feet;
(B)
Arterial with Collector—25 feet;
(C)
Collector with Collector—20 feet;
(D)
Collector with Minor Road—20 feet;
(E)
Minor Road with Minor Road—20 feet and
(F)
Service Drive or Alley—10 feet.
Section 1310. - Intersection Sight Distances.
Proper sight lines must be maintained at all intersections. Measured along the centerline, there shall be a clear-sight triangle with sides as follows:
(A)
Major Arterial Road—150 feet;
(B)
Major Collector Road—75 feet; and
(C)
Other Minor Roads—75 feet.
No building or other obstruction shall be permitted within the area defined by a clear-sight triangle.
Section 1311. - Distances between Intersections.
The distance between intersections shall be as follows:
(A)
Intersection on Arterials—Minor and Collector Roads shall not empty into Arterials at intervals of less than six hundred (600) feet and shall be in alignment with existing and planned roads entering the arterial from the opposite side.
(B)
Intersections on Collector or Minor Roads—The distance between any two (2) minor or collector roads which are not in alignment on opposite sides of an existing or proposed road shall be no less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, measured from centerlines.
Section 1312. - Surfacing.
All roads except alleys are required to be surfaced to the grades and dimensions drawn on the plans, profiles, and cross-sections submitted by the subdivider and approved by the Planning Commission.
Before paving a road surface, the subdivider must install the required utilities and provide adequate drainage in accordance with City standards.
The Planning Commission shall determine if a collector or arterial road is required as a direct result of a subdivision, and in such a case the subdivider shall be responsible for paving the additional width required.
Section 1313. - Curb and Gutter.
Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed in all new subdivisions in accordance with City standards.
Section 1314. - Sidewalks.
In subdivisions where multi-family dwelling, townhouse dwellings, or group dwellings are planned, and in subdivisions which have an average lot width of seventy (70) feet or less at the building setback line, sidewalks shall be installed on at least one side of the right-of-way in accordance with City standards.
The Planning Commission may also require the installation of sidewalks in the following instances:
(A)
In subdivisions where lot widths are greater than seventy (70) feet, but where the character of the neighborhood is such that they are considered necessary;
(B)
In subdivisions where it would be desirable to continue sidewalks that are existing in adjoining subdivisions; or
(C)
In subdivisions where sidewalks are necessary to provide pedestrian access to community facilities such as schools, shopping areas and recreation areas.
Where sidewalks are required, they shall be at least four (4) feet in width and located fully within the road right-of-way. However, in the vicinity of schools, shopping areas, recreation areas, and other such facilities, sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
Section 1315. - Public Crosswalks.
Where considered necessary to provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, shopping areas, recreation areas, or other such facilities, public crosswalks not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided.
Section 1316. - Access Drives.
Access drives and curb cuts shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of the City of Brunswick Zoning Ordinance.
Section 1317. - Temporary Dead-End Roads.
Temporary dead-end roads are generally discouraged. However, where temporary dead-end roads are determined to be necessary by the Planning Commission, they shall terminate with a turn-around area having a radius not less than forty (40) feet.
Section 1318. - Unspecified Standards.
Where standards for required improvements are not specifically set forth in these regulations, the applicable standards or requirements of the City Commission and the State Highway Department shall govern. All work must be performed in the manner prescribed in the standard specifications for road construction of the City Commission and the State Highway Department.
