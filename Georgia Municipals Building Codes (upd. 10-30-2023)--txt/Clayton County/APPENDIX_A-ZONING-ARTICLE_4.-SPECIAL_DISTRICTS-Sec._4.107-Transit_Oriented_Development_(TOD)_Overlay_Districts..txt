Sec. 4.107 - Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Districts.
The purpose of the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay District is to encourage and enable the development of moderate to high-intensity, compact, mixed-use urban neighborhoods near transit stations where people can live, work, shop, dine, and pursue cultural and recreational opportunities while enjoying a range of mobility choices. TOD development standards, combined with limits on auto-centric uses, are designed to create vibrant neighborhoods with a robust network of streets, sidewalks, and bicycle paths, providing safe and convenient access to transit stations.
The new TOD Overlay District will serve multiple station areas on MARTA's planned Southlake Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line: Norman Drive, Lee's Mill, Southern Regional Medical Center, Mt Zion, and Southlake Mobility Center. This new overlay is based on the TOD-CORE- Redevelopment/ New Build Model Ordinance.
In advance of MARTA's proposed high-capacity transit lines, the purpose of the TOD district is to:
• Lay the foundation for greater density and intensity of uses;
• Encourage a mix of uses;
• Improve walkability;
• Create people-friendly places; and
• Reduce the amount and visibility of parking
Sec. 1.0 District Intent
a.
The intent of this designated Overlay District is:
1.
To enhance the quality and compatibility of development in the Overlay;
2.
To encourage appropriate redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties;
3.
To create developments that are aesthetically pleasing, people-friendly, architecturally distinct and environmentally sustainable;
4.
To encourage a mix of uses, including medical offices and services, supporting office and business uses, mixed use residential/retail, with easy access to open space and greenspace;
5.
To promote safe and efficient movement for all persons using various modes of travel within the Overlay District including motorized vehicles, bicycles, walking, and public transit;
6.
To establish consistent and relational design standards for public improvements and private property development within the Overlay in order to create a distinctive visual quality for the designated Overlay District;
7.
To allow flexibility in development standards to encourage the design of innovative development projects that set high standards for landscaping, green space, urban design, public art and public amenities.

Mixed use requirements:
A mix of development is required for all lots with primary frontage width of 50 feet or more. The degree of mix required depends on the length of the block of the frontage. Table 1 contains four options to meet the mixed-use requirements.
EXPAND
Primary Frontage Block Length
300' 500'+ 300'—499' less than
Option A: Vertical Adaptability Ground floor built with flexible dimensions to accommodate multiple uses. No additional requirements
Option B: Horizontal Mixed Use At least 25% of frontage (at liner depth) must be a different use than primary At least 15% of frontage (at liner depth) must be a different use than primary
Option C: Architectural Mix At least 33% of frontage must be architecturally distinct from the rest of the structures At least 25% of frontage must be architecturally distinct from the rest of the structures
Option D: Mixed Income At least 20% of units are legally binding affordability restricted
Option E: Special Review Submit site concept for review; must demonstrate alignment with local land use vision/plan
  (1)
Option A: Vertical Adaptability.
A.
The ground floor must be built with dimensions to accommodate both residential or retail use.
B.
Although encouraged, commercial use on the ground floor is not required to be in place at buildout. If the ground floor is not commercial at buildout, it should be adapted to commercial use once local market conditions support ground floor commercial uses.
C.
Residential units in this option qualify for the lowest average of 600 heated square feet.
(2)
Option B: Horizontal Mixed Use. To achieve a mix of uses within a site, the following is required:
A.
Determined by block length, a site must vary its uses by a percentage of its primary frontage width as shown in Table 1. At a minimum, the secondary use must extend to a liner depth of at least 40 feet.
B.
Uses can include any of those that are permitted by right in the TOD zone.
C.
Only residential units in the same building with a secondary use shall qualify for the mixed-use minimum of 600 heated square feet. When residential units are in a separate building, the minimum is 750 square feet.
(3)
Option C: Architectural Mix. If a mix of uses is not practical, an architectural mix can be used to meet the requirement. The percentage of the frontage that must be architecturally distinct is determined by the primary block size shown in Table 1.
A.
To qualify as architecturally distinct, there must be clear visual differences in at least three of the following:
1.
Architectural banding, trim, or cornice detail
2.
Window size and placement
3.
A covered entryway or front porch design
4.
Building projections and recesses
5.

7.
Number of stories; at least 0.5 story difference must be present
8.
Roofline variation
9.
Other element approved by the Clayton County

(5)
Option E: Special Review. Clayton County will consider submittals of site plans that do not meet the requirements in Options A, B, or C, but meet the TOD Overlay District's intent to encourage mixed, visually diverse environments. To submit a plan for special review, the following is required:
