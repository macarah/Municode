(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-97. - Ethics.
It is the policy of Clayton County to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the county finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible suppliers wishing to furnish products and services to the county. Clayton County will set up and conduct a purchasing program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to suppliers who offer the best value.
(1)
Clayton County declares that employees and officials, along with those wishing to do business with the county, have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices.
(2)
Clayton County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain unfair advantage in a procurement competition, and as outlined in the County's Ethics Code found in Article 2, Section 70-61, et seq. and all other applicable policies.
(3)
Prospective suppliers must compete for county business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee, or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction.
(4)
Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the county seeks to establish relationships with suppliers whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The director is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation. Violations by Clayton County employees and officials will be governed by the Clayton County Civil Service Rules and the Clayton County Code of Ethics, Clayton County Code of Ordinances, Art. II § 70-61, et seq.
(5)
A supplier's contract compliance history with Clayton County and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation.
(6)
Clayton County stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The director is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the county's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the county's goals.
(7)
Clayton County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of unfair advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. When a conflict of interest is discovered, the employee involved shall promptly file a written statement concerning the matter with an appropriate supervisor. The person may also request written instructions and disposition of the matter. If an actual violation occurs or is not disclosed and remedied, the employee involved may be reprimanded, suspended, or dismissed pursuant to the Clayton County Civil Service Rules and the supplier or potential supplier may be placed on the ineligible source list and/or have their existing contract canceled.
(8)
It is unethical for any Clayton County employee or official to purchase goods and/or services from a county contract for personal use, unless the goods and/or services are made available to employees through the contract specifically for that purpose.
(9)
Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a Clayton County contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other county representative other than the department of central services employee named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners, unless specified otherwise herein. Attempting to influence the outcome of any given contract prior to a recommendation of award to the board of commissioners is strictly prohibited. The director will review alleged violations of this prohibition. If the director determines that such a communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by that person may be disqualified from consideration for award, and that person may, among other things, be placed on the ineligible source list. Violations by Clayton County employees and officials will be governed by the Clayton County Civil Service Rules. Violations may also be subject to prosecution under federal, state or local laws.
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-98. - Appropriate expenditures.

(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-99. - Budgeted expenditures.
Consistent with the goal of ensuring fiscal stewardship of county resources it is the responsibility of each elected official or department director to ensure all purchases made for or by their agency or department are consistent with, and support the current approved budget prior to committing funds. Specific approval is required for certain capital purchases, as provided in the County Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-100. - Non discrimination.
Clayton County strictly prohibits discrimination in the conduct of any county government affairs based on age, color, religion, sex, race, national origin, veteran status, disability or any other basis prohibited. No individual or business shall be discriminated against on the grounds of same in connection with the award or performance of any contract paid for, in whole or in part, with funds of the county.
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-101. - Severability
Should any court of this state declare any section, part, paragraph or clause of this Purchasing Code unconstitutional or invalid for any cause or reason, then such decision shall affect only that section, part, paragraph or clause so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, and shall not affect any other section, part, paragraph or clause of this Purchasing Code.

DIVISION 3. - PURCHASING METHODS

Sec. 2-111. - Summary of general purchasing methods.
This Purchasing Code recognizes two methods of procurement: competitive and non-competitive. The director shall make the determination as to the type of procurement appropriate to secure all commodities, equipment and services for the county, its agencies and departments.
(1)
Competitive procurement methods.
a.
Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of purchase in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
1.
clear and adequate specifications;
2.
cost of materials, supplies, equipment, or services is in excess of $74,999.99; and/or
3.
revenue is expected to be in excess of $74,999.99.
Unless otherwise provided herein, formal sealed bids must be obtained for any item or service which is expected to cost in excess of $74,999.99 or is expected to generate revenue greater than $74,999.99, unless the competitive sealed bid process is either not applicable or is determined by the director not to be in the best interest of the county as outlined herein. Information related to the process for competitive sealed bids is outlined herein in section 2-113.
b.
Competitive sealed proposal. When the following factors exist or use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Factors include:
1.
whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services;
2.
whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities;
3.
whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award;
4.
cost of equipment or services is in excess of $74,999.99; and/or

revenue is expected to be in excess of $74,999.99.
Unless otherwise provided herein, formal sealed proposals must be obtained for any item or service which is expected to cost in excess of $74,999.99 or is expected to generate revenue greater than $74,999.99, unless the competitive sealed proposal process is either not applicable or is determined by the director not to be in the best interest of the county as outlined herein.

c.
Informal purchase. Any purchase of commodities, goods and services less than $74,999.99 will be considered an informal purchase.

Purpose. There is established in Clayton County, a local vendor preference.

Sec. 2-149. - Small local business opportunity program.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of the SLBE program of the county is to promote the economic welfare of the people of the county and to promote full and equal business opportunity for all persons doing business with the county by providing assistance to SLBEs that would allow them to actively participate in the county's procurement process, and by working to eliminate discrimination in both public and private markets. The county seeks to determine whether eliminating discrimination against and assisting all small firms in a race and gender-neutral fashion will eliminate identified discrimination against MWBEs and eliminate the need for race and gender conscious actions.
(2)
The county, through the CCD and in accordance with this section, in its ongoing effort to evaluate the utilization of MWBEs to assure equal opportunity with regard to county procurement activities and assist in collecting data to determine whether a race-conscious initiative will be necessary to effectuate that objective, will monitor the progress of this program in that regard.

Program effectiveness measurements will also include efforts by the CCD to provide prime contracting opportunities for SLBEs. At the end of each contract, the CCD will prepare a report on the utilization of firms in the SLBE opportunity program as compared to all firms utilized by the county. Data in this report will include information on the gross income size of the firms participating on each contract with their NIGP Codes, race or ethnicity and gender status, and address, including county. Each project manager and procurement officer will continuously maintain, and compile monthly, information relating to the department's use of SLBE, including information regarding subcontractors and attainment toward the SLBE opportunity program participation goal.

(2)
At the end of a contract, the CCD shall require a contractor to report to the CCD the identity of each SLBE to whom the contractor has awarded a subcontract for the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment.
(3)
The CCD shall prepare a consolidated report based on a compilation and analysis of the reports submitted by each project manager and reports of payments provided by the finance department.

The program is designed to include all segments of the county's business community by increasing the competitiveness and profitability of all small businesses as defined within this program.
(e)
Program Goals. The contract compliance division will set contract goals for SLBEs on a contract by contract basis for each specific prime contract with subcontracting possibilities. Contract goals for SLBEs based inside the county may be set separately from contract goals set for SLBEs based outside the county.
SLBE participation is counted as follows:
(1)
Once a firm is determined to be an eligible SLBE, in accordance with this policy, the total dollar value of the contract awarded to the SLBE is counted toward the applicable SLBE goals.
(2)
The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals a portion of the total dollar value of a contract with an eligible joint venture equal to the percentage of the ownership and contractual commitment to the SLBE partner in the joint venture.
(3)
SLBE performance of a "commercially useful function" and SLBEs as contractors:
a.
The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goal only expenditures to SLBEs that perform a "commercially useful function" in the work of a contract. An SLBE is considered to perform a "commercially useful function" when it is responsible for execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To determine whether an SLBE is performing a commercially useful function, the county or a contractor shall evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, and other relevant factors.
b.
Consistent with normal industry practices, SLBEs may enter into subcontracts. If an SLBE contractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the SLBE shall be presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function. The SLBE may present evidence to rebut this presumption to the county.
(4)
The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals 50 percent of its expenditures for materials and supplies obtained from SLBE regular dealers and 100 percent of such expenditures to a manufacturer, provided that the SLBE assumes the actual and contractual responsibility for the provision of the materials and supplies as follows:
a.
For purposes of this section, a manufacturer is a firm that operates or maintains a store, warehouse, or other establishment in which the materials or supplies required for the performance of the contract are bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold to the public in the usual course of business. To be a regular dealer, the firm must engage in, as its principal business, and in its own name, the purchase and sale of the products in question. A regular dealer in such bulk items as steel, cement, gravel, stone, and petroleum products need not keep such products in stock, if it owns or operates distribution equipment. Brokers and packagers shall not be regarded as manufacturers or regular dealers within the meaning of this section.
b.
The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals the following expenditures to SLBE firms that are not manufacturers or regular dealers:
1.
The fees or commissions charged for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials or supplies required for performance of the contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the county to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.
2.
The fees charged for delivery of materials and supplies required on a job site (but not the cost of the materials and supplies themselves) when the hauler, trucker, or delivery service is not also the manufacturer of, or a regular dealer in, the materials and supplies, provided that the fee is determined by the county to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.

(2)
Direct assistance to SLBEs. The CCD will assist SLBEs in overcoming barriers to program participation. This assistance will be offered directly by the county, as well as by referral to other assistance agencies through established, comprehensive, and continuous programs. Businesses requiring management and technical assistance will be identified through a questionnaire, personal experience with these businesses, and requests for assistance.
The CCD will offer the following assistance directly to SLBEs:
a.
The CCD will provide information on the county's contractual requirements and projected procurement opportunities.
b.
The CCD will provide counseling and training sessions for SLBEs. County staff will be available to interested business representatives to explain (in detail) instructions for preparation of bid specifications, the county's procurement policies, procedures and general bid requirements. The CCD will coordinate and follow up all requests for assistance to insure that all necessary information was provided.
c.
The CCD will provide coordination and referral to existing business development organizations.
d.
Upon request, SLBEs will be provided with information on specific reasons for unsuccessful bids through debriefing sessions. The CCD will review individual solicitations to ensure that insurance and bonding provisions are not excessive. Assistance in obtaining insurance and bonding will be provided to SLBEs.
e.
The CCD will provide intensive workshops and training sessions on identified SLBE problem areas, i.e., pricing and estimating, joint venture formation, accounting principles, marketing, etc.
f.
Information on the county's SLBE program will be disseminated through written materials, seminars, workshops, and specialized assistance to individual firms.
(i)
Methods by which the county will require contractors and subcontractors to comply with applicable SLBE requirements. The CCD staff is available to assist contractors and subcontractors in implementing this program. As a standard procedure, such assistance includes:
(1)
Clear identification of the county's SLBE provisions in all the county solicitations;
(2)
Pre-proposal/bid conference to explain the county's SLBE program;
(3)
Identification of certified SLBEs per the county's solicitation including a list of certified SLBE available to all document holders;
(4)
Lists of document holders made available to interested SLBEs, as well as CCD staff available to assist bidders/proposers in developing their SLBE programs;
(5)
County staff's monitoring SLBE participation levels on projects throughout the duration of a contract. Contractors violating contract provisions regarding SLBE participation are subject to sanctions, including contract termination.
(j)
Means to ensure that competitors make good faith efforts to meet SLBE contract goals.
(1)
For all contracts for which contract goals have been established, the county shall in the solicitation inform competitors that the competitors will be required to submit SLBE participation information to the county and that the award of the contract will be conditioned upon satisfaction of the requirements established by the county. The apparent successful competitor shall submit, at the time of the bid opening or proposal review, the following information:
a.
The name and address of SLBE firms that will participate in the contract;
b.
The description of the work each named SLBE will perform; and
c.
The dollar amount of participation by each named SLBE firm.
(2)
If the SLBE participation submitted by the competitor does not meet the SLBE contract goals, the competitor must submit evidence demonstrating that "good faith efforts" were made to meet the goals. To determine sufficient "good faith efforts" to meet the SLBE contract goal, a bidder/proposer shall document the steps it has taken to obtain SLBE participation, including but not limited to the following:
a.
Attendance at a pre-bid meeting, if any, scheduled by the county to inform SLBEs of subcontracting opportunities under a given solicitation;
b.
Advertisement in general circulation media, trade association publications, and other media for at least 15 days before bids or proposals are due;
c.
Written notification to SLBEs that their interest in the contract is solicited;
d.
Efforts made to select portions of the work proposed to be performed by SLBEs in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the stated goal;
e.
Good faith efforts to negotiate with SLBEs for specific sub bids, including, at a minimum:
1.
The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of SLBEs that were contacted;
2.
A description of the information provided to SLBEs regarding the plans and specifications for portions of the work to be performed; and
3.
A statement of why additional agreements with SLBEs were not reached.
4.
Concerning each SLBE, the competitor contacted but rejected as unqualified, the reasons for the competitor's conclusion; and
5.
Efforts made to assist the SLBEs contacted that needed assistance in obtaining bonding or insurance required by the competitor or the county.
(3)
To determine whether a competitor that has failed to meet SLBE goals may be awarded the contract, the county will determine whether the efforts the bidder/proposer made to obtain SLBE participation were "good faith efforts." Efforts that are merely pro forma are not "good faith efforts" to meet the goals. In order to award a contract to a bidder/proposer that has failed to meet SLBE contract goals, the county will determine whether the bidder/proposer actively and aggressively made efforts to meet the county's SLBE goals. Competitors that fail to meet SLBE goals and fail to demonstrate "good faith efforts" shall not be eligible to be awarded the contract.
(4)
To ensure that all obligations under contracts awarded to SLBEs are met, the County shall review the contractor's SLBE involvement efforts during the performance of the contract. The contractor shall bring to the attention of the county any situation in which regularly scheduled progress payments are not made to SLBE subcontractors.
(k)
Outreach to SLBEs. Information dissemination and communication with SLBEs is an integral part of the county's SLBE program. As a part of its outreach program, the CCD will solicit input from representatives of SLBEs, trade associations and community organizations. This input will serve several important functions, including:
(1)
Providing information to identify additional SLBE firms;
(2)
Assisting in refining SLBE Program goals and procedures; and
(3)
Providing an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the county's SLBE program.
(l)
Procedures to require that participating SLBEs are identified by name by competitors for contracts. The CCD shall indicate, in solicitations for contracts that provide opportunities for SLBE participation, goals for the use of SLBE firms. Solicitations shall require all bidders/proposers to submit a written assurance of meeting the goals in their bids or proposals. Bids must also include a proposed schedule of SLBE participation that lists the names of SLBE subcontractors, a description of the work each is to perform, and the dollar value of each proposed SLBE subcontract. If the SLBE participation does not meet the SLBE contract goals, the bidders/proposers must submit sufficient information and evidence demonstrating that the bidder/proposer made "good faith efforts" to meet the goals. Bidders/proposers are required to submit this information prior to the issuance of the notice to proceed and bidders and proposers are so informed at the time of solicitation. Agreements between a bidder/proposer and a SLBE in which the SLBE promises not to provide subcontracting quotations to other bidders/proposers shall be prohibited.
(m)
Maintenance of records and reports.
(1)
Records.
a.
The CCD will maintain an electronic monitoring and reporting system which tracks the progress of the county's SLBE program. At a minimum, this electronic record keeping system will identify and assess SLBE contract awards, prime contractors' progress in achieving SLBE subcontract goals, and other efforts to assist SLBEs. Specifically, the CCD will maintain records showing:
1.
Procedures that have been adopted to comply with the county's requirements;
2.
Awards to SLBEs, including names of contractors and subcontractors, nature of the work/services to be performed, and the percentage of SLBE participation per contract. To assist in this effort, the CCD will obtain regular reports from prime contractors on their progress in meeting contractual SLBE obligations and specific efforts to identify and award contracts to SLBEs.
(2)
Reports.
a.
The CCD shall compile data and prepare reports including, but not limited to the following:
1.
The copies of direct mailings to SLBEs;
2.
Pre-bid conference information as it relates to the county's SLBE provisions;
3.
Requests for assistance from SLBEs interested in bidding/proposing on the county's contracts and subcontracts;
4.
Workshops, seminars and training programs conducted for SLBEs; and
5.
Efforts to assist SLBEs in acquiring bonding and insurance.
b.
The CCD will submit, at least, annual SLBE reports to the Director of Central Services. These reports shall include at a minimum:
1.
The number of contracts awarded to SLBEs;
2.
A description of the general categories of contracts awarded to SLBEs;
3.
The dollar value of contracts awarded to SLBEs;
4.
The percentage of the dollar value of all contracts awarded to SLBE during the preceding quarter; and an indication of whether the percentage met or exceeded the SLBE goals specified per contract.

Sec. 2-150. - Procurement non-discrimination program.
(a)
MWBE certification. Certification is the qualifying process that ensures that a particular business is a MWBE that performs a commercially useful function. Certification assures that interested MWBEs have the proper ownership, control, and management as defined in the program. Current contact information about the certifying entity shall be maintained by the CCD and provided to interested persons upon request.
(b)
Reciprocal certification. Subject to the approval of the director of the central services, the county may accept certification of a MWBE from another government or private entity having certification standards at least as stringent as those created in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-151. - Benchmarks.
(a)
Definition and purpose. The county has a compelling interest in providing equal business opportunities for all persons wishing to do business with it. Therefore, the county will monitor and track MWBE availability and participation in the procurement process through benchmarks. Benchmarks are not quotas, but a method enabling the county to compare the participation of MWBEs in the procurement process with expected participation rates based on the availability of MWBEs within the MSA.
(b)
Procedure for establishing benchmarks. The CCD shall establish and recommend proposed benchmarks to the Director of Central Services semiannually. The CCD shall evaluate the levels of MWBE participation for the county government's overall procurement program. As part of the review, the CCD may consider data regarding MWBE participation for the preceding three fiscal years for a more accurate portrayal of MWBE participation. The CCD shall review available MWBE totals and percentages for the MSA that shall be reported in ranges showing expected MWBE participation rates on county government projects for each procurement sector based on MWBE availability within the MSA. MWBE availability shall be determined in accordance with current legal, economic, statistical and social science standards. The contract compliance manager shall consult with the contracts administrator in developing the benchmarks. The contract compliance manager may employ one or more qualified consultants each year to assist the CCD in determining MWBE availability. Benchmarks during the first year of the program shall be based on data compiled in the county disparity study, a copy of which shall be placed on file in the office of the Director of Central Services.
(c)
Comment period. The CCD shall publish proposed benchmarks in a newspaper of general circulation at least once each week for four consecutive weeks and shall receive public comments submitted within ten days after the final such publication. The CCD shall consider all public comments duly submitted, additional recommendations of the CCD, make any necessary changes to the benchmarks, and submit the proposed benchmarks to the central services director. The CCD shall make any revisions the county commission feels are necessary and shall then issue the final benchmarks, a copy of which shall be filed with the county clerk.
(d)
Review of benchmarks. The benchmarks shall be in effect for a period of one year. The CCD shall review benchmarks semiannually and shall report its findings to the county commission. All total contract dollars awarded to MWBEs shall count towards benchmark percentages.

The statement shall include each successful subcontractor's name, NIGP Code, race, gender, national origin, business location, work to be performed, dollar value of the project, and percentage attributable to each subcontractor. In addition, copies of each successful subcontractor's price quotes must be submitted by the close of business on the second business day following submission of a bid.
(c)
Statement of interested subcontractors/vendors. Each bidder shall submit a statement of interested subcontractors/vendors that shall include each individual or entity requesting information about the project or solicited for participation on the project. The list of subcontractors shall include those persons who did not actually submit a price quotation or a bid, rather just requested information. The statement shall include the individual's or entity's name, NIGP Code, race, gender, national origin, business location, and information requested.
(d)
Statement of bid proposals/price quotations. Each bidder shall submit a statement of bid proposals/price quotations.

In the event that a bidder or participant proposes to use subcontractors or joint ventures if awarded a contract with the county, such bidder shall be required to submit to the CCD a letter of intent signed by both the subcontractor/joint venturer and bidder. This form is to be completed and submitted by the apparent successful bidder by the end of the second business day following issuance by the contracts administrator of a notice of award of contract.
(f)
Other information and data. The CCD may request additional information and data prior to a contract award. This information may include, without limitation, information regarding business ownership of all subcontractors to be utilized on the project, all of which shall reflect the race, gender, ethnic origins, location, and structure of the identified businesses, in order to be eligible for contract award. The CCD with the approval of the contracts administrator may declare any bid non-responsive upon failure or refusal of the bidder to provide information and data required by this program and requested by the county pursuant to this paragraph.
(g)
Reporting subcontractor substitution or replacement. The prime contractor shall report any replacements or substitutions of the use of subcontractors to the CCD in advance of making the substitution. For reporting purposes, the prime contractor shall report to the CCD statistical data pertaining to the new subcontractor, including race, gender, national origin, and business location.
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-152.1. - Evaluation of bid for program compliance.
(a)
If the bid submitted by the first ranked bidder who has submitted the lowest cost responsive bid in response to a solicitation issued by the contracts administrator, includes the documents required by section 2-152 of this division, the contracts administrator shall forward the bid to the CCD. The CCD shall then evaluate whether the first ranked bidder has engaged in and adequately documented with its bid efforts that its process of soliciting, evaluating, and awarding subcontracts, placing orders, and partnering with other companies has met the criteria of the program, including the use of good faith efforts. Upon a recommendation of compliance by the first ranked bidder, the CCD shall notify the contracts administrator. The contracts administrator shall proceed to award a contract upon concurrence with the CCD recommendation.
(b)
If the CCD's preliminary analysis suggests that the first ranked bidder who has submitted the lowest cost responsive bid has failed to comply with good faith or other requirements of the program, the CCD shall send written notice to the bidder. The notice shall set forth with particularity the reasons for questioning the bidder's non-compliance and shall schedule a conference at which time the issue may be reviewed with the bidder. The bidder shall be permitted to present any additional material relevant to the question of non-compliance for consideration by the CCD. If, after the conference and upon consideration of all relevant material, the CCD is convinced that the bidder is in fact compliant with the requirements of this chapter, the CCD shall notify the contract administrator, who shall proceed with awarding the contract concurrent with the CCD's recommendation. If the CCD concludes that the bidder is not compliant with the requirements of this chapter, the CCD shall notify the contract administrator, who shall, upon concurrence with the conclusion, reject the non-compliant bidder's bid, identify another bidder as the new ranked bidder who has submitted the lowest cost responsive bid, and forward the new ranked bidder's bid to the CCD. The CCD shall then proceed to evaluate the bid submitted by the new ranked bidder who has submitted the lowest cost responsive bid. The contract compliance manager shall decide whether a determination of non-compliance shall be made pursuant to section 2-113(h)(4) of division 3 of this article, "Purchasing Methods".
(c)
Decisions of the contract compliance manager under this section are subject to protest by filing a written protest with the director of central services within seven business days. The director of central services will issue the final determination of the county within 15 business days of receipt of the protest, or if the director requires more than 15 business days, the director will advise the bidder within the initial ten days of the additional amount of time required to render a decision.

Sec. 2-152.2. - Sanctions and penalties for non-compliance.
The CCD shall recommend appropriate mechanisms to enforce the provisions of this program to the contract administrator. Further, the failure of a bidder or participant to comply with the requirements of this chapter may be grounds for suspension or debarment by the contracts administrator pursuant to the standards set forth in this chapter. Sanctions shall not be imposed unless there is evidence of specific conduct on the part of participant that is inconsistent with or in direct contravention of the applicable provisions of this program. In determining appropriate sanctions, the contracts administrator shall consider the following factors:
(1)
Whether the failure to comply with applicable requirements involved intentional conduct or, alternatively, may be reasonably concluded to have resulted from a misunderstanding on the part of the participant of the duties imposed on them by this program;
(2)
The number of specific incidences of failure by the participant to comply;
(3)
Whether the participant has been previously suspended;
(4)
Whether the participant has failed or refused to provide the CCD with any information required or requested by this program;
(5)
Whether the participant has materially misrepresented any applicable facts in any filing or communication to the CCD; and
(6)
Whether the participant has subsequently restructured or taken other action to cure the deficiencies in meeting applicable requirements.

The CCD shall encourage all contractors and subcontractors to participate in a mentor/protege initiative on a voluntary basis for the purpose of enhancing the potential of all SLBEs by building business capability to expand contracting opportunities within an agreed framework of conditions. The initiative is intended to assist in integration of on-the-job training for all SLBEs and permit a prime contractor to offer assistance on a limited term agreement, generally one project. Any interested contractor or subcontractor may submit with a bid a completed mentor/protege promise demonstrating that such a relationship has been formed. The CCD shall make available a database of potential mentor and protege firms. No contractor or vendor shall be penalized or preferred based upon participation or non-participation in this initiative. All administrative functions should be performed by the protege personnel. The protege is expected to maintain final decision-making responsibilities regarding the scope of its work.

Sec. 2-155. - Sale of real property.
(a)
Public sale required. It is the policy of the Board of Commissioners that county-owned real property shall be identified for sale, transfer, or other disposition in accordance with Georgia law. Also, unless otherwise provided by law, the sale or disposition of all interests in county-owned real property shall be to the highest responsible bidder by competitive sealed bidding, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-9-3, as amended.

(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17)
Sec. 2-156. - Disposition of personal property.
(a)
Declaration of unserviceability. The Director shall effectuate the sale of personal property owned by the county under the supervision of the Board of Commissioners when it is determined and certified by the Director and the head of the user department in charge of the property that the property has depreciated to the point of useless life or to the extent that it is advisable to dispose of said personal property and is therefore unserviceable. The Director shall determine whether a particular item or category of personal property can no longer be used advantageously by the County and has therefore become unserviceable after conferring with the head of the user department desiring to sell the property. The Board of Commissioners may establish criteria establishing unserviceability for categories of personal property which may become unserviceable on a regular, frequently recurring basis, and may delegate to the Director the determination of whether a particular commodity meets the criteria of unserviceability for its category.
(b)
Disposition. No sales of unserviceable county personal property shall be made by the Director under this section where other provisions of law provide for such sales, but this section shall apply to the sale of unserviceable county personal property where no other provision of law is made. Unserviceable personal property may be sold by public sale, sealed bidding, spot bidding or any other means deemed most advantageous to the County under the particular circumstances as determined by the Director. A sale to a private person shall be for the highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the County. A sale to another unit of government shall be for a fair and reasonable purchase price that need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person. All sales for personal property items where the original unit purchase cost is $25,000.00 or less shall be approved by the Director. The Board of Commissioners shall approve sales for personal property where original unit cost exceeds $25,000.00. The Director shall remit the proceeds from the sale to the Chief Financial Officer for deposit into the general fund.
