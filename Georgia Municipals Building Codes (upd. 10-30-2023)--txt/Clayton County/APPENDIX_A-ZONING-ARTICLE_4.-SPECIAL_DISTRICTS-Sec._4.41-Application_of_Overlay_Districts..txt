Sec. 4.41 - Application of Overlay Districts.
A.
Overlay Districts are supplemental to the underlying zoning district classifications established in the Clayton County Zoning Ordinance that governs all properties within Clayton County. Within areas mapped as Overlay Districts in this Article, these Overlay District regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, stated underlying zoning regulations which shall still apply except where inconsistent with the regulations of the Overlay District.
B.
The standards and requirements of the Overlay District shall govern in any case where standards and requirements of the Overlay District conflict with those of the base zoning district or other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, including but not limited to the Subdivision Regulations.
C.
Any parcel of land that is wholly or partly within the boundary shall be included in the applicable Overlay District.
D.
The provisions of each designated Overlay District shall apply to all applications for Zoning Amendments, Conditional Use Permits, Planned Unit Developments, Site Development Plans, Construction Plans, Preliminary Plats, Final Plats, and Building Permits for all property and rights-of-way within the boundaries of the Overlay District.
E.
The same uses are permitted in the Overlay District as in the underlying zoning district and any use that is prohibited or subject to conditional use approval in the underlying zoning district is similarly prohibited or subject to conditional use approval in the Overlay, unless otherwise specified herein.
F.
All State and County road and utility projects shall be exempt from all requirements of the Overlay District.
