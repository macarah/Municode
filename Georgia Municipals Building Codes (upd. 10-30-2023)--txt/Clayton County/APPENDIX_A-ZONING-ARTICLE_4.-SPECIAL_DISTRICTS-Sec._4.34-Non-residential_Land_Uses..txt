The Zoning Administrator may approve a reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for a specific use where inter-parcel access is provided and a shared parking analysis, which is approved by the Zoning Administrator, demonstrates that adequate parking will be provided.

a.
Determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for each use category from Article 6.32, Parking Standards (PK) of the Zoning Ordinance.
b.
Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods shown on the table below.
c.
Total the number of parking spaces for each of the time periods (add together the numbers in each column).
d.
The largest column total is the minimum shared parking requirement for the development or collectively for the contiguous properties.
e.
In no case shall parking spaces that are farther than 1,000 feet from a building entrance be allowed to satisfy off-street parking requirements for a use or be counted towards shared parking requirements.
