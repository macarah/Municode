Sec. 4.18 - Parking Standards.
Off-street parking shall be required as in Article 6.32. Parking Standards (PK), of this Zoning Ordinance, except as provided below.
1.
Location. No more than 25 percent of the required number of parking spaces for a non-residential zoning district and/or use shall be located in the front yard.
2.
Screening. Where a parking lot is adjacent to a street or public right-of-way, the parking lot shall be screened from the right-of-way by a minimum landscape strip of 10-feet wide having a variety of hardy shrubbery, flowering plants, and flowering/shade trees, as approved by the County Arborist, or his/her designee.
3.
Lighting. Parking lots with more than 25 spaces must be illuminated. Lighting fixtures must minimize the diffusion of light to other properties in accordance with Article 6.36, Outdoor Lighting (OL), with the following modifications:
a.
All lighting poles and fixtures shall be decorative, as approved by the Zoning Administrator.
4.

Uses that require up to 25 off-street parking spaces for motorized vehicles shall provide at least one bicycle space, plus a minimum of one more bicycle space for each additional 50 parking spaces required for motorized vehicles.
5.
Shared parking. The following standards shall apply for shared parking.
a.
The Zoning Administrator may approve a reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for a specific use where inter-parcel access is provided and a shared parking analysis, which is approved by the Zoning Administrator, demonstrates that adequate parking will be provided.
b.
Per the table below, a shared parking calculation projection shall be provided that demonstrates that each use will have adequate parking provisions at all times. The process for determining the minimum parking requirements for a mixed use development or for contiguous properties containing multiple uses is:
i.
Determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for each use category from Article 6.32, parking Standards (PK) of this zoning ordinance.
ii.
Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods shown on the table below.
iii.
Total the number of parking spaces for each of the time periods (add together the numbers in each column).
iv.
The largest column total is the minimum shared parking requirement for the development or collectively for the contiguous properties.
v.
In no case shall parking spaces that are farther than 1,000 feet from a building entrance be allowed to satisfy off street parking requirements for a use or be counted towards shared parking requirements.
