ARTICLE 7. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)

Sec. 7.1 - Intent.
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) district is intended to permit private or public development or redevelopment of areas throughout the County that are substantially in accord with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. The use patterns of the areas involved shall provide a desirable environment and shall be harmonious with the general surrounding uses permitting flexibility in overall development while ensuring the highest of safeguards and standards for public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. The PUD district shall encourage the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability; conserve natural and social/cultural resources and provide sustainable design and energy efficiency; encourage innovation in land use and community planning; and bring about a greater compatibility of design and use.
Sec. 7.2 - District Intent, Permitted Uses and Miscellaneous Standards.
The purpose of the PUD is to stimulate the development of balanced neighborhoods containing physical, economic, and social assets difficult to achieve through the traditional separation of uses and density limits. This is accomplished by allowing the applicant the freedom necessary to: protect natural resources; protect and improve social and economic development; and, to protect the investment of both the County and the development.
In reviewing the PUD, the following guidelines should be observed:
A.
The protection of both the aesthetics and function of the natural environment.
B.
The arrangement of buildings and other improvements advantageous to the orderly function and aesthetics of both the natural and man made environment,
C.
The preservation of adequate, permanent open space for the use of residents and workforce in the development and the County.
D.
A variety of housing types and densities necessary to achieve and balanced neighborhood.
E.
The provision land area necessary to accommodate all cultural, educational, recreational, and other activities necessary to serve the needs of the development and County.
F.
The orderly and creative arrangement of all land uses with respect to each other and the County (including residential, commercial, industrial and public uses).
G.
The provision of developed recreational activity areas necessary to serve the needs of any residential portion of the development.
H.
The provision of a pedestrian environment separate from the vehicular environment.
I.
The creation of neighborhoods compatible with the County's Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
Sec. 7.2.1. Uses.
All uses indicated as permitted, accessory, and conditional in all zoning districts except HI (Heavy Industrial) are uses subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners in the same manner as conditional uses. Approved uses shall be so indicated by the Board's adoption of the approved site plan.
Sec. 7.2.2. Site plan.
The proposed PUD site plan must provide for a minimum of twenty percent (20%) open space. The site plan must also indicate each permitted use, including number of lots, size of lots and setbacks. Any non-residential use shall be integrated with the community, and not designed to cater exclusively to outside markets. The approved site plan shall constitute the zoning of the property.
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 23, 5-30-17)
Sec. 7.3 - Origination of Proposals.
Any applicant may propose a Planned Unit Development District in accordance with the procedures established in this Article. Further, the applicant making such a proposal must intend to act as developer or sponsor of the development. A parcel or site proposed for Planned Unit Development need not be under single ownership, but the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
Sec. 7.4 - Eligibility.
To be eligible for Planned Unit Development consideration, the applicant must present a proposal for residential development that meets each of the following:
A.
Recognizable benefits. A Planned Unit Development shall result in a recognizable and substantial benefit, both to the residents of the property and to the overall quality of life in the County. The benefits can be provided through site design elements in excess of the requirements of this ordinance, such as high quality architectural design, extensive landscaping, transition areas between adjacent land uses, unique site design features, unified access, provision of social space, preservation of woodlands and open space, particularly along major thoroughfares, and buffering development from lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands. This benefit should accrue, in spite of any foreseeable detriments of the proposed development.
B.
Uses proposed. The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public health, safety, welfare or convenience or any combination thereof, on present and potential surrounding land uses. The uses proposed will encourage a more efficient use of public utilities and services and lessen the burden on circulation systems, surrounding properties, and the environment. This beneficial effect for the County (not the developer) shall be one which could not be achieved under any other single zoning classification. The zoning is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development proposal.
C.
Qualification requirements. The proposed development shall provide at all of the following:
1.
Preservation of significant natural assets. The site contains significant natural assets such as woodlands, rolling topography with grades exceeding fifteen (15) percent, significant views, natural drainage ways, water bodies, floodplains, regulated or non-regulated wetlands, or natural corridors that connect quality wildlife habitats which would be in the best interest of the County to preserve and which might be negatively impacted by conventional residential development.
2.
Recreation facilities. If the site lacks natural features, it can qualify if the development will preserve existing or provide new recreation facilities and open spaces to which all residents of the development shall have reasonable access. Such facilities include areas such as a neighborhood park, plazas, golf course, passive recreational facilities, soccer fields, ball fields, bike paths or similar facilities which provide a feature of community-wide significance and enhance residential development.
3.
Mixed use & Infill development/redevelopment. The development will provide a complimentary and integrated mixture of uses, residential densities and housing types. A project which proposes a combination of single-family detached and multiple-family housing or a mixture of compatible residential and commercial uses may be considered a Mixed Use Project. Such mixture of uses shall be integrated into a cohesive, pedestrian scale neighborhood. Land located within the older urbanized area of the County qualify for development as mixed use.
4.
Infill development/redevelopment. Land located within the older urbanized area of the County qualify for development as mixed use.
D.
Guarantee of open space. Usable open space shall be provided, as required herein. The applicant shall guarantee to the satisfaction of the County that all open space portions of the development will be maintained in the manner approved.
E.
Cohesive neighborhood. The proposed development shall be designed to create cohesive community neighborhoods through a network of spaces such as parks, plazas and common open space areas for passive or active recreation and resident interaction. All open space areas shall be equally available to all residents of the development.
F.
Unified control. The proposed development shall be under single ownership or control, such that there is a single person or entity having proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
G.
Density impact. The proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the need for or impact on public services, facilities, roads, and utilities in relation to the use or uses otherwise permitted by this ordinance, and shall not place an unreasonable impact to the subject and/or surrounding land and/or property owners and occupants and/or the natural environment.
H.
Parking. Off-street parking sufficient to meet the minimum required by Section 6.32, Parking Standards, shall be provided. Deviations from the Parking Standards are possible, and require justification via a valid traffic study.
I.
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided so as to ensure that proposed uses which may impede upon neighboring uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public and private property. Landscaping and buffering sufficient to meet the minimum required by Section 6.34, Landscaping Standards, and Section 6.35, Buffer Yard Standards, shall be provided. Deviations from the Landscaping Standards and Buffer Yard standards will be considered, provided that a landscape plan prepared and stamped by a certified landscape architect is prepared and submitted. Said landscape plan will bear the burden to prove how the proposal is more beneficial than the Landscaping Standards and Buffer Yard standards.
J.
Circulation. Vehicular and non-motorized (pedestrian) circulation, allowing safe, convenient, uncongested and well-defined/understandable circulation within and to the district, shall be provided.
K.
Comprehensive plan. The proposed development shall be consistent with and further the implementation of the Adopted Clayton County Comprehensive Plan and Future Land Use Map for the County.
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 23, 5-30-17)
Sec. 7.5 - Dwelling Density.
Residential densities shall be consistent with the County's approved Comprehensive Plan and Future Land Use Map.
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 23, 5-30-17)
Sec. 7.6 - Area and Bulk Regulations.
A.
Basic regulations. All regulations applicable to setbacks, parking and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in relation to each respective land use in the development based upon zoning districts in which the use is listed as a permitted, accessory, or conditional use. The height, bulk, and area conditions set forth in Article 3, Zoning District Intent, Uses and Standards, shall be used as guidelines for the use areas set forth in the PUD plan.
B.
Regulatory flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the intent of the PUD regulations, the County Board of Commissioners may permit specific departures from the requirements of the zoning ordinance for yards and lots as a part of the approval process. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a finding by the County that the deviation shall result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards.
1.
A table shall be provided on the site plan which specifically details all deviations from the established zoning area, height and setback regulations, off-street parking regulations, general provisions, or subdivision regulations which would otherwise be applicable to the uses and development proposed in the absence of this PUD article. This specification should include ordinance provisions from which deviation are sought, and the reasons and mechanisms to be utilized for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in lieu of the regulations from which deviations are sought. Only those deviations consistent with the intent of this ordinance shall be considered.

Prior to filing a Planned Unit Development petition, the applicant must submit a sketch plan to the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator will make a cursory review of the sketch plan and give the applicant comments within ten (10) calendar days of submission. The Zoning Administrator may also convene a conference with representatives from the County and the applicant to discuss the application and review process. At this conference, the applicant will be provided with information regarding the procedural review requirements, design and development standards, submission requirements, and design and construction requirements for infrastructure and natural resource protection.
B.
The applicant then files a Conceptual Development Plan and all supporting application documentation with the Department of Community Development.
C.
The Technical Review Committee then reviews the Conceptual Development Plan and all supporting application documentation and provides comments to the applicant.
D.
The applicant then files a rezoning petition requesting the Planned Unit Development classification and a Detailed Development Plan with the Department of Community Development. If a subdivision is required, a Preliminary Plat shall also be filed at this time and shall follow the appropriate procedures set forth in the Clayton County Subdivision Control Ordinance.
E.
The Technical Review Committee then reviews the application and provides comments to the applicant.
F.
The application is then placed on the agenda of the Zoning Advisory Group for a public hearing on the rezoning of the property and for review of the Detailed Development Plan and Preliminary Plat.
G.
The Zoning Advisory Group then reviews the petition and forwards a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners to grant or deny the rezoning request and the Detailed Development Plan.
H.
The Board of Commissioners reviews the rezoning petition and the Detailed Development Plan and the recommendation from the Zoning Advisory Group and votes to approve or disapprove the rezoning petition and the Detailed Development Plan.
I.
If the Board of Commissioners approves the rezoning and Detailed Development Plan, the land is officially rezoned.
J.
The Official Zoning Map is amended to reflect the zoning change, the date of approval by the Board of Commissioners, and the resolution number.
K.
When approved, the Detailed Development Plan shall be signed by the Zoning Advisory Group Chairman and/or Vice-chairman. The applicant may then begin procedures for obtaining Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit and Grading Permit. The Board of Commissioners must have approved the Detailed Development Plan prior to the issuance of any Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit and Grading Permit. If a subdivision is required, the Preliminary Plat must also be approved prior to the issuance of an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit and Grading Permit. The Detailed Development Plan becomes the zoning on the property.

The Board of Commissioners shall consider all proposed zoning conditions in its review of the rezoning application. At the Board of Commissioners request, any deletion, addition, or alteration of the proposed zoning conditions may be referred back to the Zoning Advisory Group for consideration and inclusion in a revised or affirmed recommendation regarding the application.

Zoning conditions may be modified only through the Zoning Amendment process described in this ordinance.
Sec. 7.14 - Minor Modifications.
The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority, in the administration of the Planned Unit Development, to approve minor modifications of the Detailed Development Plan without a public hearing in a manner consistent with the purpose or intent of the overall development. Minor changes are those that implement only slight alterations to the approved conditions, made necessary by actual field conditions at the time of development, that do not alter the impact of the development on nearby properties nor the intent or integrity of the conditions as originally imposed. Any request for minor change of the Detailed Development Plan shall be made in written form to the Zoning Administrator. Furthermore, the request for minor change shall be accompanied by copies of the revised Detailed Development Plan.
Any major change to conditions attached to an approved Detailed Development Plan shall require an application and hearing before the Zoning Advisory Group and the Board of Commissioners as is required in this Ordinance for amendments to the Planned Unit Development distinct. Without limiting the meaning of the phrase, the following shall be deemed to constitute "major change" for purposes of interpreting this section:
1.
The movement of any building or structure adjacent to an exterior boundary line, closer to the boundary line of the property;
2.
Any increase in the number of dwelling units or any increase in the total amount of floor space of any nonresidential building;
3.
Any change in any buffer requirement(s) imposed in the original conditional zoning amendment;
4.
Any increase in the height of any building or structure; or
5.
Any change in the proportion of floor space devoted to different authorized uses.
An adversely affected party may appeal any decision by the Zoning Administrator to the Board of Zoning Appeals within thirty (30) calendar days of the determination. The Board of Zoning Appeals has the authority to establish rules governing the nature of proceedings and notice required to make a modification under this Article.
Sec. 7.15 - Covenants and Maintenance.
Covenants, when required by the Board of Commissioners, shall be set forth in detail. Furthermore, covenants shall provide for the release of restrictions upon execution of a document so stating and suitable for recording bearing signatures of the Board of Commissioners' Chairman and/or Vice Chairman, upon authorization by the Board of Commissioners, and signatures of all the owners of property in the area involved in the petition for whose benefit the covenant was created. Covenants required by the Board of Commissioners shall provide that their benefits be specifically enforceable by the Department of Community Development. An executed recorded copy shall be provided to and maintained in the Community Development Department office.
A.
Adequate provisions shall be made for a private organization (i.e., Home Owner's Association) with direct responsibility to, and control of, the property owners involved to provide for the operation and maintenance of all common facilities if such facilities are a part of the Planned Unit Development; and, in such instance legal assurances shall be provided which show that the private organization is self-perpetuating.
B.
All common facilities not dedicated to the public shall be maintained by the private organization in such a manner that adequate access is provided at all times to vehicular traffic so that fire, police, health, sanitation, and public utility vehicles can serve the contiguous and adjacent properties. All streets and roadways not dedicated to the public shall be operated and maintained at no expense to any governmental unit.
Sec. 7.16 - Recording.
All approved Detailed Development Plans, covenants, written commitments, plats, and modifications thereof shall be recorded in the office of the Clayton County Clerk of Superior Court within ten (10) calendar days of approval. The developer shall provide two (2) copies bearing recording information to the Department of Community Development for its records.
