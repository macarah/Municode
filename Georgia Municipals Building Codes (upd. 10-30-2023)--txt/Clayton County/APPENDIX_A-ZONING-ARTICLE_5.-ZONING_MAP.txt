(Ord. No. 2012-258, Pt. I, 12-11-12)
Sec. 5.6 - Official Zoning Map Standards.
District boundaries of the Official Zoning Map shall be interpreted as follows:
A.
District boundaries indicated as following land lot lines, platted lot lines, or County or City corporation lines shall be construed as following such lines.
B.
District boundaries indicated as approximately following the center line of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines.
C.
Where a district boundary line divides a lot at the time such line is adopted, the district in which the majority of the area of the property is included shall apply to the entire property. In cases where a property is divided equally between two or more zoning districts, the most restrictive district shall apply to the entire property. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the applicable zoning for properties divided into several zoning districts consistent with this section.
D.
If the Zoning Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by scale or dimensions stated on the Official Zoning Map, or by the fact that it does not clearly coincide with a property line, immediate action on any application shall be refused. The Zoning Administrator will then have 14 calendar days to consult all County records and departments to determine the zoning classification of the property in question. A letter reporting the Zoning Administrator's findings and zoning classification shall be issued to the applicant and copied to the department's files. Any ruling of the Zoning Administrator or official designee pertaining to the district boundaries may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. No. 2012-258, Pt. I, 12-11-12)
Sec. 5.7 - Zoning of Abandoned Rights-of-Way.
Whenever any street, alley or other public way, within the county is abandoned, such street, alley, or other public way or portion thereof, shall automatically be classified in the same zoning district as the property to which it attaches.
(Ord. No. 2012-258, Pt. I, 12-11-12)
