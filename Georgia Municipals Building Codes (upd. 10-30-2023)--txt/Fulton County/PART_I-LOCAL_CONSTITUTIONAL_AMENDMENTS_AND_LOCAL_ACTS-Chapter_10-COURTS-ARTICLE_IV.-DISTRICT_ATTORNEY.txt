Sec. 10-112. - Disposition of costs, fines, forfeitures and fees; reports and records.
In the distribution among officers of the court of all cost, both in particular cases or matters and all insolvent costs and fines, forfeitures and fees paid into the superior court of the said Atlanta Judicial Circuit, or which may become due and payable therein, the County of Fulton shall be subrogated to the rights and claims of the district attorney of said circuit, and any former district attorney, and shall stand in their places and stead and shall be entitled to all funds, moneys and emoluments accruing to the said office in the said judicial circuit; and hereafter when orders on the insolvent funds or other judgments or findings are entered or approved in behalf of other officers of the court instead of the same being entered and approved in the name of the district attorney as under the present system, the same shall be entered and approved in the name of the district attorney for the use and benefit of Fulton County. All cost both in particular cases or matters, and all insolvent cost and all fines, forfeitures and fees and all moneys and emoluments accruing to the office of the district attorney in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit, under any laws heretofore or now existing or which may hereafter be enacted, shall be collected by the district attorney of said circuit and paid by him into the treasury of said county.

Sec. 10-113. - Bond; embezzlement proceedings.
The district attorney of said judicial circuit shall diligently and faithfully collect all fees, fines and forfeitures that may occur and become due in the superior courts of said circuit and shall accurately account for and pay the same over to the treasury of said county. The district attorney shall give bond in the sum of $25,000.00 in a corporate surety company which has qualified under the laws of Georgia to do business in said state and which has and maintains an office and place of business in Fulton County. The premium on said bond shall be paid by the county as a part of and in the same manner as the other operating expenses of the Criminal Division of Fulton Superior Court. Wilful failure or refusal to pay over to the treasury of Fulton County, or to such other officer authorized by law to receive the same, all moneys collected for the said county under this article, shall constitute embezzlement, and shall be punished as such, and when any person makes affidavit before the court or grand jury, that in his judgment the district attorney is guilty of such embezzlement, and that he desires to prosecute him, or the grand jury may present him for such an offense, the court must instanter appoint some competent attorney-at-law to draw a bill of indictment, and, when there is a true bill found, to put the district attorney under a recognizance or in prison, until the appearance of the proper prosecuting officer; and the governor of the state, upon the presentment of such facts to him, must suspend such district attorney from office, pending the disposition of the case upon such indictment, and upon conviction the said district attorney shall, by order of the governor, be removed from office and a new district attorney appointed for the unexpired term. These remedies and provisions are not exclusive but cumulative and in addition to all existing and future laws applicable in cases of misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance in office.
