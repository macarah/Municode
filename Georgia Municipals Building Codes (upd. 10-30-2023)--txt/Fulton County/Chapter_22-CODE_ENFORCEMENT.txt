(a)
General. No member of the board shall have the power to initiate enforcement proceedings under this chapter. If a violation of any provision of the Code of Laws is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and specify a reasonable time to correct the violation. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified the code inspector may so notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. If a violation is not corrected within the time specified, the code inspector shall request a hearing before the board.
(b)
[Notification.] If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the board and request a hearing. The case may be presented to the board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice for the violator shall so state. The matter shall be scheduled for the next available hearing before the board, and notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in section 22-36.
(c)
[Violation presents threat to public welfare.] If the code inspector has substantial reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and immediately notify the board and request a hearing.
(d)
Continuance. The board may continue the hearing from time to time for good cause. The board shall, in all instances, reach a decision within 15 calendar days from the date of the final hearing at which receipt of all evidence has been concluded.
(e)
Postponed hearing. When a quorum if not present, or the board is unable to reach a decision on a case, the hearing shall be postponed until the next scheduled board meeting, with notification provided in accordance with section 22-36 of this chapter.
(f)
Order to comply/order to pay fine. Every order to comply and/or order to pay fine entered by the board shall be executed by the chairperson, or, in the chairperson's absence, the vice-chairperson, and shall be filed in the office of the secretary to the board.
(1)
If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the board finds that a violation does exist, the board may issue an order to comply consistent with the powers granted in this chapter and the Act, with findings and conclusions. An order to comply shall set forth the street address or a description of the structure and/or premises sufficient for identification. An order to comply shall include notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that an administrative fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date. The order shall state the nature of the violation, and the board shall consider the following factors in determining the content of the order to comply.
a.
Existence or nonexistence of a life, health or other type of hazard to the occupant or others in the building or premises;
b.
Severity of the hazard or negative effect upon the community;
c.
Number and extent of separate items that must be completed in order to bring the building or premises into compliance with the relevant codes;
d.
Length of time the violation (s) has been known to exist and the amount of time the code inspector has previously given for compliance;
e.
The existence or nonexistence of mitigating factors which caused the building or premises to be in violation or which may affect the amount of time for compliance.
f.
The board may divide the violation (s) into groups requiring compliance at various intervals, with inspections to be conducted at each stage by the code inspector.
(2)
An order to pay fine shall specify the fine amount as determined and voted upon by the board, as well as the date and time the fine is due. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of Fulton County and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. If an order to pay fine is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the fine is paid by the date and time specified in the order, the board shall issue an order acknowledging that the fine has been paid in full and such order shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging the payment of a fine.
The board may issue an order to pay a fine against the violator if the cited violation was not corrected within the time specified on the code inspector's notice or if an order to comply was not satisfied within the time specified in said order, even if said violation was corrected and brought into compliance prior to the hearing at which the fine was imposed.
(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-36. - Hearing notification.
(a)
Notification of the board hearing to the alleged violator shall be given by the director of the department or his/her designee by certified mail, return receipt requested or hand delivery by the code inspector or other persons designated by the department to the alleged violator's usual place of residence; or by leaving said notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person therein who is over 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of business with a manager or other upper level employee who is over 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice, no later than the 15th day before the date of the hearing. The notice shall be in a form approved by the director of the department and shall include a reference to the provisions of the Code of Laws and/or conditions of zoning being violated, and the date, time and location of the hearing.

At the option of the board, and in addition to the notice described above, notice of the hearing may be published 30 days prior to the hearing once a week for four consecutive weeks in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements are printed for Fulton County. Proof of publication shall be provided and maintained for the official record.
(c)
Where efforts to provide notice pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section are unsuccessful, evidence of an attempt to serve the alleged violator pursuant to paragraph (a) together with proof of publication as provided in paragraph (b) shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this section have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.
(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-37. - Notification of decision.
The board shall provide the violator a copy of the order to comply and/or the order to pay fine by hand delivery or certified United States mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, within a reasonable period of time after the decision.

A fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per day for a violation involving the health or safety of a third party.
(2)
A fine not to exceed a total of $1,000.00 for a violation not involving the health or safety of a third party.
(3)
The board shall determine fines considering the following factors:

(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-39. - Failure to pay fine.
(a)
A certified copy of an order to pay fine may be recorded in the public records of any county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the Superior Court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the board may request that the county attorney foreclose on the lien.
(b)
No lien imposed under this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order to pay fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in Superior Court. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, which it incurs in the foreclosure. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.
(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-40. - Remedies.
Nothing contained in this ordinance shall prohibit the board, acting through the code inspector, from enforcing this ordinance by any other lawful means which include both criminal and civil proceedings; provided, however, that the board shall not pursue a specific instance of an alleged violation of the Code of Laws against the violator before both the board and a court authorized to hear violations of local ordinances.
(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-41. - Appeal and transfer.
An aggrieved party, including Fulton County, may appeal a final administrative order of the board to the Superior Court of Fulton County as provided for in the Act.
(Ord. No. 05-0290, Exh. A, 2-16-05)
Sec. 22-42. - Severability.
It is declared to be the intent of the board of commissioners that, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not effect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
