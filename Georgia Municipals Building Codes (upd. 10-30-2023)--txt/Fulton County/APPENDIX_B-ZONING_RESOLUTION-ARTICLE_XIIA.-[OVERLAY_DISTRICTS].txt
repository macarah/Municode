12A.1 - Overlay district authority.
12A.1.1 Declaration of purpose, scope, intent and public policy. The Fulton County Board of Commissioners finds that as a matter of public policy that the aesthetic, economic and functional qualities of unincorporated Fulton County are worthy of enhancement and preservation and are essential to the promotion of the health, prosperity, safety and general welfare of the existing and future residents of unincorporated Fulton County. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners authorizes each planning area to propose overlay districts and regulations, and, if desired, to request that the board appoint a design review board. The purpose of said design review board and overlay district regulations shall be:
1.
To foster civic pride.
2.
To promote attention to accepted design principles in areas of new development and redevelopment.
3.
To raise the level of community understanding and expectation for quality in the built environment.
4.
To implement the comprehensive plan.
5.
To provide for the designation, protection, rehabilitation and redevelopment of properties within overlay districts and to participate in federal and state programs designed to do the same.
6.
To protect and enhance local aesthetic and functional qualities and to stimulate business.
7.
To enhance the opportunities for federal, state and local tax benefits under relevant federal, state and local laws.
The Board of Commissioners further finds that the timely exercise of judgement in the public interest by a public body of proposed new development or redevelopment is desirable. Accordingly, the public policy objectives of this resolution are to guide certain aspects of development, such as:
1.
The spatial relationships of structures and open spaces to each other, and
2.
The appearance of buildings and open spaces as they contribute to the attractiveness, function, economy and character of an area.
Planning area design standards are intended to be uniformly applied to evaluate the appropriateness of proposed changes to an overlay district in order to:
1.
Protect and enhance the visual qualities and character of the district,
2.
Provide guidance to design professionals, property and business owners undertaking construction in the district,
3.
Recommend appropriate design approaches, and

Provide an objective basis for review, assuring consistency and fairness.
