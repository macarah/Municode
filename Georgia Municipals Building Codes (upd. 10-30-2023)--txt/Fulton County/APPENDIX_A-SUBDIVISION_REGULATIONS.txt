Street classifications. The classification of streets based on functions, from high-traffic arterial roads to low traffic residential streets. The following are definitions intended to distinguish between different street classifications. All roadways are classified per the Georgia Department of Transportation:
A.
Freeway. A multi-lane roadway that has full access control and separation of directional traffic. Freeways accommodate large volumes of high speed traffic and provide efficient movement of vehicular traffic for interstate and major through travel.
B.
Arterial. A functional classification for a street or highway that provides the highest level of service at the greatest speed for the longest uninterrupted distance, with some degree of access control.
C.
Principal arterial. A roadway that has partial or no access control, and is primarily used for fast or large volumes of traffic. Emphasis is placed on mobility rather than access to adjacent land.
D.
Minor arterial. A roadway that has partial or no access control and is primarily used for inter-connectivity of principal arterials and placing more emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility.
E.
Collector. A roadway that has partial or no access control and has more emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility than arterials. The primary purpose is to distribute trips to and from the arterial system and allow access to the local roads.
F.
Local. Any roadway that has no access control, and places strong emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility while service to through traffic is discouraged.
G.
Full access control. A street or highway to which owner or occupants abutting land have complete right of access.
H.
No access control. A street or highway to which owner or occupants abutting land have no right of access.
I.
Partial/limited access control. A street or highway to which owner or occupants abutting land have little or no right of access.
J.
Frontage street. A road that typically runs parallel to a partial access controlled roadway, a full access controlled facility, or a railroad. Frontage roads provide public access to the adjacent parcels, help control access to the major facility, and/or maintain circulation of traffic on each side of the major facility.
Street, residential. The following definitions are intended to distinguish between different categories of streets internal to residential subdivisions:
A.
Major subdivision street. A local road internal to a subdivision which serves 50 or more housing units. These units do not have to be directly served by the major subdivision street. Major subdivision streets are roads that serve as collectors for the subdivision traffic. Any residential street which accesses a collector or arterial road shall be considered a major subdivision street for the first 300 feet regardless of housing unit service.
B.
Minor subdivision street. A local road internal to a subdivision which serves fewer than 50 housing units and does not access a collector or arterial road.
C.
Housing unit service. The number of housing units served by a street or collection of streets shall be the aggregate number of housing units provided, or potentially to be provided, with driveway access directly from the street(s) plus the number of units utilizing or potentially utilizing the street(s) for through traffic movements. Such calculations shall be made beginning and ending at the same street intersection.
Stub-out road. A road having one end open to traffic and being temporarily terminated at the other. Stub-outs generally do not have a temporary vehicular turn-around. This temporary termination is to provide connectivity to future developments and may be constructed without curb and gutter provided such stub-out street meets the standards of the Fulton County Fire Department.
Subdivider. Any property owner, person, individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, agent of property owner, or any other group or combination acting as a unit dividing or proposing to divide land so as to constitute a subdivision as herein defined
Subdivision, residential and non-residential. Any division of a lot, tract or parcel, regardless of its existing or future use, into two or more lots, tracts or parcels. The term "subdivision" may mean the act or process of dividing property, except that, where appropriate to the context, the term "subdivision" may be used in reference to the aggregate of all lots held in common ownership at the time of subdivision.
Traffic Mitigation Action Plan. A plan that studies and addresses the number of trips a subdivision will produce when such development results in the reduction of the level of service on any roadway currently functioning at "D" or worse in accordance with the County Transportation Standards. This plan shall include, but is not limited to, roadway improvements and other proposals such as providing transit access, transit use incentives, car/van pooling, bicycle path construction, off-site and internal sidewalk construction, and lunch trip reduction. Such plan shall mitigate the traffic impact in a manner that will show no negative impact on roads with level of service of "D" or worse.
Trails, pedestrian or others. Extended and usually continuous strips of land established independently of other routes of travel and dedicated, through ownership or easement, to recreational travel including hiking, horseback riding, etc.
Utility accommodations/guidelines and procedures. A county program maintained by the department of public works which includes installing, maintaining, repairing, operating, or using a pole line, buried cable, pipeline, or miscellaneous utility facility, and performing miscellaneous operations authorized by a utility permit.
Utility permit. An official authorization issued by the department of public works, allowing alteration of land within the right-of-way for the commencement of any construction activities pertaining to utility installation or relocation.
Zoning resolution. The Zoning Resolution of Fulton County, Georgia.

ARTICLE VI. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE (Added 5-21-04; amended 8-5-15)

6.1. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to ensure preservation of open space within residential developments; provide flexibility to allow for creativity in developments; minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical natural resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures; provide an interconnected network of permanent open space; encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; enhance the community character; permit clustering of houses and structures which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility lines; encourage street design that controls traffic speeds and creates street inter-connectivity; and promote construction of convenient and accessible walking trails and bike paths both within a subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
6.2. - Applicability of regulations.
The conservation subdivision option is available for single family detached residential developments in the following districts: AG-1, R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, R-5 and R-5A in unincorporated Fulton County south of the City of Atlanta (South Fulton). Compliance with all applicable Fulton County ordinances, regulations, or resolutions is required; however, when in conflict, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
6.3. - Open space requirement.
Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total acreage as open space as defined in Article III. The open space shall be recorded on the final plat. Interconnectivity of all open space within a conservation subdivision shall be required.
6.3.1.
Open space networks configuration. The minimum standards for open space networks are as follows:
A.
The minimum width of any open space area is 25 feet.
B.
All paths shall be a minimum of 20 feet from any property line except where interparcel access may be provided.
C.
All open space networks shall provide connectivity to any common areas within the development and to any adjacent public places/rights-of-way.
D.
Paths located in primary conservation areas shall be constructed of pervious materials.
E.
Where path networks cross internal subdivision streets or public streets, access points shall be directly across from each other or as approved by the director.
F.
Crossings and access points shall be clearly identified to pedestrians and motorists and may include traffic control devices, bridges and tunnels as approved by the director.
6.4. - Open space and conservation areas.
Open space shall be designated as either primary conservation areas or secondary conservation areas and shall be configured to create or maintain a network of open space.
6.4.1.
Primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas form the core of the open space to be protected. Active recreation areas are prohibited in primary conservation areas unless approved by the director. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:
A.
Cemeteries;
B.
Habitats for endangered or threatened species as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources;
C.
Wetlands identified by the National Wetlands Inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the County Soil Survey prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service, or a certified wetlands delineation using data from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers;
D.
Alluvial soils identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and 100-year floodplain;
E.
Lakes (natural and man made), rivers, streams, existing ponds, stormwater management ponds/facilities designed in accordance with the Fulton County Subdivision Regulations, creeks, including but not limited to blue line tributaries and state waters;
F.
Riparian zones equal to any required stream buffers and improvement setbacks;
G.
Existing slopes greater than 25 percent on average with a site area greater than 5,000 square feet identified as part of a site analysis conducted by a registered engineer, land surveyor or landscape architect and calculated using topographic maps from the Fulton County GIS system or from a topographic survey prepared by a licensed land surveyor.
6.4.2.
Value of primary conservation areas. Because primary conservation areas are either protected or sensitive environmental areas, only 50 percent of the acreage of a primary conservation area may be counted as open space.
6.4.3.
Secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas consist of undeveloped (unconstrained) but buildable land and protected (constrained) lands. Secondary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:
A.
Farmlands (fields, pastures, meadows);
B.
Woodlands and buffers except riparian buffers;
C.
Historic and/or archaeological sites as identified by the Fulton County Historic Resources Survey;
D.
Passive recreation areas, public and private, to include pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails, picnic areas, community commons or greens, and similar areas;
E.
Active recreation areas and facilities, public and private, to include parks as identified by the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, playing fields, and playgrounds. Recreation areas with impervious surfaces (e.g., tennis courts, basketball courts and pools) and golf courses shall be excluded.
6.4.4.
Value of secondary conservation areas. With the exception of active recreation areas and facilities, 100 percent of secondary conservation areas may be counted as open space. Because active recreation areas are cleared and graded and therefore reduce natural resources and wildlife habitats, only 50 percent of active recreation areas and facilities may be counted as open space.

ARTICLE VII. - CEDAR GROVE AGRICULTURAL SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE (Added 12-5-07)

7.1. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to ensure preservation of open space within residential developments; provide flexibility to allow for creativity in developments; minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical natural resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures; provide an interconnected network of permanent open space; encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; enhance the community character; permit clustering of houses and structures which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility lines; encourage street design that controls traffic speeds and creates street inter-connectivity; and promote construction of convenient and accessible walking trails and bike paths both within a subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
7.2. - Applicability of regulations.
The following subdivision requirements are for residential developments in all zoning districts in that portion of unincorporated Fulton County bordered to the west by the Chattahoochee River, to the south by Coweta County, and to the east by the Cascade Palmetto Highway (SR 154) except for villages, hamlets and minor subdivisions. Compliance with all applicable Fulton County ordinances, regulations, or resolutions is required; however, when in conflict, the most restrictive provisions shall prevail.
7.3. - Open space requirement.
Each subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total acreage as open space as defined in Article III. The open space shall be recorded on the final plat. Interconnectivity of all open space within a subdivision shall be required. (Amended 9-2-15)
7.3.1.
Open space networks configuration. The minimum standards for open space networks are as follows:
A.
The minimum width of any open space area is 25 feet.
B.
All paths shall be a minimum of 20 feet from any property line except where interparcel access may be provided.
C.
All open space networks shall provide connectivity to any common areas within the development and to any adjacent public places, paths or rights-of-way.
D.
Paths located in primary conservation areas should be constructed of pervious materials.
E.
Where path networks cross internal subdivision streets or public streets, access points should be directly across from each other.
F.
Crossings and access points shall be clearly identified to pedestrians and motorists and may include traffic control devices, bridges and tunnels.
7.4. - Open space and conservation areas.
Open space shall be designated as either primary conservation areas or secondary conservation areas and shall be configured to create or maintain a network of open space.
7.4.1.
Primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas form the core of the open space to be protected. Active recreation areas are prohibited in primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:
A.
Cemeteries;
B.
Habitats for endangered or threatened species as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources;
C.
Wetlands identified by the National Wetlands Inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the County Soil Survey prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service, or a certified wetlands delineation using data from the U.

G.
Existing slopes greater than 25 percent on average with a site area greater than 5,000 square feet identified as part of a site analysis conducted by a registered engineer, land surveyor or landscape architect and calculated using topographic maps from the Fulton County GIS system or from a topographic survey prepared by a licensed land surveyor.
7.4.2.
Value of primary conservation areas. Because primary conservation areas are either protected or sensitive environmental areas, only 50 percent of the acreage of a primary conservation area may be counted as open space.
7.4.3.
Secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas consist of undeveloped (unconstrained) but buildable land and protected (constrained) lands. Secondary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following:

F.
Alternative wastewater treatment facilities as approved by the department.
7.4.4.
Value of secondary conservation areas. With the exception of new active recreation areas and facilities, 100 percent of secondary conservation areas may be counted as open space.

A.
Stop signs (R1-1): The STOP sign shall be installed on the right side of the approach to which it applies. Stop lines, when used to supplement a stop sign, should be located at the point where the road user should stop. Where there is a marked crosswalk at the intersection, the stop sign should be installed in advance of the crosswalk line nearest to the approaching traffic.
Stop signs should be installed in a manner that minimizes the numbers of vehicles having to stop. In most cases, the street carrying the lowest volume of traffic should be stopped. A stop sign should not be installed on the major street unless justified by a traffic engineering study as recommended by the MUTCD. If two streets with relatively equal volumes and/or characteristics intersect, typically the direction that conflicts the most with established pedestrian crossing activity or school walking routes or the direction that has the longest distance of uninterrupted flow approaching the intersection should be stopped.
No all-way stops may be installed in a new subdivision without the permission of the director of the department of public works.
B.
Yield signs (R1-2): These should be installed when there are right turns at an intersection that are channelized apart from the through and/or left turn movements with a striped or raised island. In addition, yield signs should be installed on each approach of a roundabout.
C.
Right lane must turn right signs (R3-7R): One of these signs should be installed 25 feet from the back of the deceleration lane of the development, if applicable.
D.
Speed limit signs (R2-1): These should indicate a 25 mph speed limit for streets internal to residential subdivisions, unless it is a local collector road for the development, and then it should be no higher than 35 mph. Only one speed limit sign shall be installed at each project entrance.
E.
Street names signs (D3): Corner mounted street name signs must be installed at every intersection and must conform to Fulton County Ordinance 01-0582 and standards designated by the department of public works. Overhead street name signs shall be installed where a subdivision street intersects at any traffic signal instead of corner mounted signs.
F.
Roundabout signs: Roundabouts must be signed and marked per Fulton County standards. This includes yield signs for every approach, as well as an advance roundabout sign as established by the department of public works. The pavement marking shall include yield lines and channelization islands for each approach.
G.
Other signs: Additional signs may be required as appropriate by the department of public works.
H.
A sign and marking plan shall be submitted for approval prior to the installation of any signs. (Added 9-2-15)
