APPENDIX A - Appropriateness of Proposed Land Uses within a Restricted Pipeline Area
The purpose of this table is to increase awareness and encourage early communication among key stakeholders when considering changes to an existing land use or new land use development within an existing restricted pipeline area.
This table provides a list of common land use activities and is only meant to provide guidance to those tasked with determining whether the proposed land use is acceptable or not. There will be variances in the application of these rules from operator to operator based on site-specific conditions, operator practices, and evolving safety regulations and concerns. Therefore, this table should be referenced only for general informational purposes. Stakeholders should consult with the appropriate pipeline operator for acceptable land uses within a restricted pipeline area.
EXPAND
Use/Activity
Acceptable Use? Additional Restrictions
or Comments Origin/Rationale for
Determining
Acceptable Activity
Agriculture - (Seasonal Agricultural Crops - excludes orchards and vineyards) Yes, but
consent is
required Activities related to the growing of crops or the raising of animals need no consent, provided the activity does not involve installation of permanent structures or an increase or decrease in the cover over the transmission line. Facilities such as underground and overhead irrigation systems must be reviewed for compatibility. With prior approval from the transmission line operator, grass and certain types of shrubs or seasonal crops may be permitted within the right-of-way (ROW), provided that the plantings do not interfere with the maintenance, inspection and operation of the transmission line and related facilities.
Airstrip - Private
(perpendicular crossing to transmission line) Yes, but
consent is
required Permission to use the easement for an airstrip may be granted, provided it is for the private use of the property owner, and does not involve any increase or decrease in the cover over the transmission line or the installation of any permanent structures, including paving, on the easement. These airstrips are considered to be dirt. This use can lead to a decrease in ground cover.
Airports - Public No These runways are constructed of concrete. Therefore, the need for access for transmission line maintenance and emergency response activities preclude this use. In addition, most airports have restricted access for security reasons.
All-Terrain Vehicle
(ATV) Use No Occasional use such as farm equipment may be acceptable. This use can lead to a decrease in ground cover.
Athletic Stadium (e.g., baseball field, football field, running tracks, etc.) No Even fields with no permanent structures may define the area as a high consequence area (HCA), thus imposing additional integrity management requirements for the gas transmission line operator.
Automobile Wrecking Yards No Access for transmission line maintenance and emergency response activities preclude this use.
Blasting No Not allowed on easements or fee land where any transmission line facilities are installed. Exceptions are for construction of another approved activity, subject to transmission line operator's engineering review for technique, size of holes, spacing, etc. Blasting activities may cause stresses on nearby transmission lines which may lead to leaks.
Buildings No No type of permanent structure permitted. See also "Structures". No structures are allowed because they interfere with emergency response, maintenance, inspection, and repair activities.
Campsites No This use may impose additional integrity management requirements for the transmission line operator. In addition, no fires would be allowed for safety reasons.
Canopies/temporary
(Categorized as party tents, canvas awnings, or portable coverings for group gatherings) No This use could involve driving large stakes into the ground near the transmission line, exposing it to potential damage and future leaks.
Canopies/permanent (Categorized as weather and environmental shelters such as those over gas stations and emergency room/hospital entrances, and drive-through covers for banks, pharmacies, fast-food restaurants, etc.) No Structures may interfere with emergency response, maintenance, inspection, and repair activities. Canopies may entrap gases and vapors that could find ignition sources from vehicle or pedestrian activities. Concrete under canopies could cause gas to migrate to building in the event of a failure.
Carports, permanent No No type of permanent structure permitted. See also "Structures". Access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities preclude this use.
Catch Basins
(Storm sewer inlet) No Access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities preclude this use.
Cathodic Protection
Devices Yes, but
consent is
required Cathodic protection facilities may be installed provided they are coordinated with other utilities and all interference problems are eliminated. Their use should be approved by the transmission line operator's cathodic protection department. To ensure adequate cathodic protection for all transmission lines, routine testing should be scheduled and performed by qualified personnel to prevent interference issues.
Cemetery No Access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities preclude this use.
Concrete Slabs
(Categorized as for foundation, typically poured for permanent structure, equipment, or storage location). No Not recommended except where they may be installed to provide for transmission line protection from third-party damage (submit plans for review) or for easement across ROW (such as for driveways or roads). (See also Roads, Driveways, Road Crossing, and Structures.) Access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities preclude this use.
Driveways Yes, but
consent is
required Transmission line operator engineering review required for all proposed streets, roads and driveways to ensure transmission line cover is adequate to support the load from the road crossing. Additional cover, concrete, or other forms of mechanical protection may be required to ensure the transmission line does not incur damage as a result of this use and traffic loads.
Dumps No This use would not allow transmission line operator easy access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities.
Erosion Control Yes, but
consent is
required Structures or materials to prevent soil erosion due to wind or water may be located on the transmission line ROW provided: 1) They do not interfere with the installation, operation or maintenance of the transmission line. 2) The design has been approved by the transmission line operator's engineering and environmental departments. 3) The facilities have taken into account the effect of the environment of the area. Placement of structures and material must allow for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities to be conducted by the operator, as well as allow for emergency response access.
Exploration - Geologic and Geophysical Yes, but
consent is
required Subject to proper indemnification and site cleanup. Must be approved by transmission line operator's operations or engineering department. Also see Blasting, Construction Equipment, and Wells. 3D seismic studies, depth of cover, transmission line operating stress levels, and other factors must be considered. The vibrations used to create the sound waves for these exploration activities are quite intense and may compromise the integrity of the transmission line, leading to leaks if not properly evaluated.
Fences - Parallel to ROW Yes, but
consent is
required (General) No masonry or brick fences are allowed. In addition, fences and transmission line should be separated by adequate distance to allow for potential future repairs. Adequate access to and around transmission line facilities must be maintained. Fences must not interfere with access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities.
Fences - Perpendicular
to ROW Yes, but
consent is
required (General) No masonry or brick fences are allowed. Adequate access to and around transmission line facilities must be maintained. Transmission line company retains the right to require the installation of a gate in the fence with a corporation lock where necessary to maintain such access. Gates should be wide enough to allow transmission line operator's equipment to gain access for repairs and emergencies. Fence posts must not be installed directly over transmission line. Fences should be installed to allow for easy removal during emergency response. One-call notification required for fence construction. Fences must not interfere with access for transmission line maintenance, inspection, and repair activities. Additional requirements may be imposed to protect transmission line from damage during construction.
Flammable Material No Managed burns for controlling vegetation may be performed by organizations such as BLM or DNR or by farmers, but this activity must be coordinated with transmission line operator to ensure public safety. No combustible material is to be stored on the easement. For safety reasons no flame or fire associated with an incineration process or with flammable material storage is allowed due to the combustible material transported in the transmission lines.
Flood Control Yes, but
consent is
required Transmission line operator engineering review can be made to consider buoyancy and ensure transmission line is adequately protected.
Flooding Yes, but
consent is
required If there is a possibility of periodic flooding, buoyancy of transmission line must be considered. Intentional flooding is prohibited because it can cause stresses on the transmission line leading to integrity issues; buoyancy must be considered.
Golf Courses Yes, but
consent is
required May be allowed if no permanent structures are placed on ROW. Cover must be adequate and must allow for maintenance, inspection, and repair activities.
Highways Yes, but
consent is
required Easements should be granted for highway construction although operator may request reimbursement for the cost of protecting, upgrading or relocating the transmission line so that it complies with all applicable regulations and requirements. Where a highway is widened to take in an area where the transmission line operator has a prior ROW, the transmission line operator may require reimbursement for that portion of the work that falls in the area where the company has prior rights. Transmission Line cover must be adequate to support the load from the highway to ensure the transmission line does not incur damage. Review by the transmission line operator's engineering group is required for all proposed streets, roads, and driveways to ensure transmission line cover is adequate to support the load from the road crossing. Additional cover, concrete, or other forms of mechanical protection may be required to ensure the transmission line does not incur damage as a result of this use and traffic loads.
Hiking Trails Yes, but
consent is
required Provided reasonable access to facilities is maintained. See also Landscaping and Cuts and Fills. Trails must be placed to allow transmission line maintenance, inspection and repair activities to be conducted.

Parking Yes, but
consent is
required A private property owner may park vehicles used in his work (such as farm equipment) on the transmission line ROW but not over the transmission lines. Use of the easement as a commercial or other publicly used parking lot, whether paved or unpaved, should be discouraged and not be allowed without review. The transmission line company will not accept liability for damages to the parking facility caused by the exercise of its rights under the easement, and reserves the right to prohibit vehicular parking on its easement at any time. Transmission line companies conduct maintenance activities on a frequent basis. Parking vehicles on the ROW may interfere with some of these maintenance practices.
Parks Yes, but
consent is
required The ROW may be used as part of a park area, but permanent structures may not be located on the ROW. Specific plan review required. Use must not interfere with transmission line maintenance and inspection activities. This use may define the area as a HCA, thus imposing additional integrity management requirements for the transmission line operator. In addition, no permanent structures are to be placed on the ROW.
Patios No No structures are allowed because they interfere with transmission line emergency response and repair activities and increase risk for transmission line operators.
Pipelines Yes, but
consent is
required Permits generally are granted for other pipelines to cross a transmission line ROW, provided: 1) Crossing is kept as close to a right angle as possible. 2) The crossing pipeline maintains clearance approved by operator above the transmission line below the transmission line. Pipeline crossings above the transmission line should be strongly discouraged. 3) Installation makes provisions for future use of transmission line ROW. 4) Precautions are taken to protect both facilities from interference problems due to cathodic protection. 5) Crossing pipeline meets all Federal, State and local requirements with respect to safety and environment. 6) Parallel encroachments are not allowed (See "Utilities Parallel"). Significant design, construction, and maintenance code activities are performed to ensure the safety of the public and employees near transmission lines. These design, construction, and maintenance activities also ensure the integrity of the transmission lines. Additional construction requirements may be imposed to protect the transmission line and allow future maintenance activities to be performed.
Play Equipment Yes, but
consent is
required No permanent structure may be installed on ROW. Play equipment without embedded footings or foundations may be allowed. Use must not interfere with transmission line maintenance and inspection activities. This use may define the area as a HCA, thus imposing additional integrity management requirements for the transmission line operator. In addition, no permanent structures are to be placed on the ROW.
Porches No No structures are allowed because they interfere with transmission line emergency response, maintenance, inspection and repair activities. Also, they increase the risk for transmission line operators.
Power Lines Yes, but

Pumps No Failure of equipment could elevate risks; permanent structures do not allow for easy access for transmission line emergency response.
Pump Islands
(Categorized as fuel pumps for automobile service stations - general transportation refueling stations) No No structures are allowed because they interfere with transmission line emergency response, maintenance, inspection, and repair activities. Also, they increase the potential consequences if a failure occurs.
Quarries and
Strip Mining No Quarrying activities not on but in proximity to the ROW should be brought to the attention of the transmission line company for assessment of potential impacts to the integrity of the ROW and transmission line facilities (See Blasting). This activity limits access for transmission line emergency response.
Railroads Yes, but
consent is
required Railroad crossings are permitted, provided the railroad company agrees to pay the cost to upgrade or protect the transmission line. Clearances must be provided as required in Cuts and Fills. Transmission line cover must be adequate to support the load from the railroad crossing to ensure the transmission line does not incur damage; vibrations need to be properly evaluated for cyclic fatigue to ensure the integrity of the transmission line is not compromised, leading to leaks. Review by the transmission line operator's engineering group is required for all proposed railroad crossings to ensure the transmission line cover is adequate to support the load from the crossing. Additional cover, concrete, or other forms of mechanical protection may be required to ensure the transmission line does not incur damage as a result of this use and traffic loads.
Recreation Areas Yes, but
consent is
required ROW may be used for general recreation that does not require the use of any permanent structures or facilities.
