SECTION 39.
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this charter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this charter, which shall remain of full force and effect as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this charter if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
