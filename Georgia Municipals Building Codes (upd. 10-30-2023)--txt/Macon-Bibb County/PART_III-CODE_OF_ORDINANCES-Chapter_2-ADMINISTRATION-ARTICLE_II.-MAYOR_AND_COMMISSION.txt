(a)
Main motion. In order for the Macon-Bibb County Commission, (hereinafter the "Commission"), to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the presiding officer until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he or she has made at any time before the Commission has voted on that motion.
(b)
Debate. After the main motion is recognized by the presiding officer, the Commission shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the presiding officer in a manner that is fair to all members of the Commission. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the presiding officer. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce Subsidiary Motions that propose that the Commission take a particular action on a motion (Section 5). There are two classes of Subsidiary Motions: Debatable Subsidiary Motions and Undebatable Subsidiary Motions. Debatable Subsidiary Motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable Subsidiary Motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three Undebatable Subsidiary Motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. Commissioners may also introduce Privileged Motions (Section 6). Privileged Motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged Motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on Privileged Motions.
(c)
Voting procedure. Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the Mayor can call for the vote. Absent an objection, the presiding officer can proceed with the vote;
b.
If the presiding officer calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the Commission may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a vote of at least five commissioners, debate will stop. The presiding officer will then read the proposed motion to the Commission and ask for the votes of the commissioners.
(2)
Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall read the proposed motion to the Commission and then call for the vote.
(d)
Ranking of motions. Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the Commission returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with the table in this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list.

Three subsidiary motions, (amend, limit debate and vote immediately), also can apply to other subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the Commission, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. The affirmative vote of at least five members of the commission is required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he or she can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. The affirmative vote of at least five members of the commission is required for the Commission to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the Commission shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the Commission can act on a main motion and the matter to be considered has not already been reviewed by a committee, he or she may propose that the motion be referred to a committee. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee will report back to the Commission. This motion is debatable and amendable. The affirmative vote of at least five members of the commission is required is required for the motion to pass.
(4)
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time.

If this motion is passed, the presiding officer will bring the original motion back to the Commission for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. The affirmative vote of at least five members of the commission is required is required for the motion to pass.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion.

Debate is not allowed on this motion and a vote of at least six members of the Commission is required for the motion to pass.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of at least six members of the Commission is required for the motion to pass.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the Commission during the same meeting.

Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the presiding officer concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the Commission as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The presiding officer is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings.

Committees. In accordance with the Charter, the committee on committees shall create, abolish, and appoint all committees and the members thereof. Whenever a committee is created by the committee on committees, its duties and any limitation on the scope of its duties, shall be determined by the committee on committees. Any such committees may make recommendations to the Commission, but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. A committee may take any of the following actions:
(1)
Recommend approval.
(2)
Recommend disapproval.
(3)
Recommend approval as amended.
Committees should act on items in a prompt manner and report them back to the Commission without unreasonable delay. At any time following the referral of any ordinance, resolution, or other item to a committee, the Mayor or any commissioner may make a motion to place such item as a subject to be acted on at the next regular Commission meeting. The affirmative vote of at least five members of the Commission is required for this motion to pass. Each committee shall elect its own chair and vice chair to serve for a period of one year or until a new chair or vice chair is elected. This election shall be held in January of each year. The chair and vice chair shall be eligible for reelection.
(p)
Pre-commission meetings. At the discretion of the presiding officer, the Commission may hold pre-commission meetings prior to its regularly scheduled meetings for the purposes of functioning as a committee of the whole commission.
(q)
Executive session. In accordance with Georgia law, the Commission may close a portion of a meeting to the public to discuss certain topics that are exempted from the Open Meetings Laws. Such meetings shall be referred to as executive sessions. Any portion not subject to any exemptions authorized by law shall be open to the public. Commissioners, officials, employees and other individuals who attend executive sessions are prohibited from discussing or in any other way divulging confidential information, legal advice and/or legal strategy discussed in the executive session unless:
(1)
The disclosure is required by law;
(2)
The disclosure is part of a judicial or administrative decision; or
(3)
The majority of the Commission authorizes the disclosure.
In no way shall this subsection prevent a county attorney or other attorney representing the Commission from discussing any matters discussed in executive session relative to such attorney's representation of Macon-Bibb County. Any commissioner or official that divulges, has previously divulged, or has threatened to divulge confidential information, legal advice or strategy discussion may be excluded from participation in an executive session by majority vote of at least five members of the Commission. A commissioner or official that divulges confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions may be publicly sanctioned or reprimanded by a majority vote of at least five members of the Commission.
