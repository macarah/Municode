SECTION 3.
(a)
Prior to the effective date of this charter, all powers vested in Bibb County or the City of Macon or any of their respective officers, agents, or agencies shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such effective date, the board of commissioners of Bibb County, the mayor and council of the City of Macon, and the offices of all members thereof shall stand abolished, and all emoluments appertaining thereto shall cease. Thereupon, the governments of Bibb County and the City of Macon shall terminate as such separate political entities and be merged into the government created by this charter.
(b)
When an agency of the City of Macon or Bibb County is abolished or restructured by this charter, all books, papers, maps, charts, plans, records, other equipment, and personal property in possession of the same shall be delivered to the agency to which its rights, powers, duties, and obligations are transferred.
(c)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this charter, any officer performing duties under the government of the City of Macon or Bibb County may continue to perform the duties thereof until a successor, whether under the same title of office or another, shall be elected or appointed and qualified to perform the duties, it being the intention of this charter that no duty or service shall lapse or be abandoned because of lack of an officer to perform same.
