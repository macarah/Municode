(2)
- Aggregate payments.
The aggregate of the pension payments expected to be paid to an Employee and his or her contingent pensioner under any of the above options shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the pension which the Employee is otherwise entitled to receive upon Retirement.
(3)
- Election of options.
An Employee may elect or revoke an option prior to Retirement by filing such election or revocation in writing with the Board prior to Retirement. Under no circumstances may an option be changed or revoked after the Employee's Retirement.
(4)
- Death before Retirement.
An election made pursuant to this section shall become inoperative in the event that:
(a)
the Employee's death occurs prior to actual retirement; or
(b)
the death of the contingent pensioner occurs before the Employee's actual Retirement.
(c)
If an Employee dies after becoming eligible to Retire but before applying for Retirement, and such member is survived by a Spouse, the Surviving Spouse shall be entitled to receive a benefit as if the member had elected to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the member's benefits as provided in Art. IV-A (l)(b) Option 2, such benefits to commence on the Benefit Payment Date next following the date of the Employee's death, and subsequent payments shall be made on the Benefit Payment Date of each calendar month thereafter during the lifetime of the Surviving Spouse.
(5)
- Direct rollovers.
Notwithstanding any provision of this System to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Article IV, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible Retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
'Eligible rollover distribution' shall mean any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, including any portion of the distribution that is not includable in gross income to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period often (10) years or more; and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
'Eligible retirement plan' shall mean an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an individual retirement plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408A (Roth IRA), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the Surviving Spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. For these purposes, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this System. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a Surviving Spouse.
(c)
'Distributee' shall include an Employee or former Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's Surviving Spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the Spouse. For distributions after December 31, 2009, a non-Spouse Beneficiary who is a "Designated Beneficiary" under section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, may by a direct trustee-to- trustee transfer ("direct rollover"), roll over all or any portion of his or her distribution to an individual retirement account (IRA) the Beneficiary establishes for purposes of receiving the distribution. In order to be able to roll over the distribution, the distribution otherwise must satisfy the definition of an "eligible rollover distribution" under section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. Although a non Spouse Beneficiary may roll over directly a distribution, the distribution is not subject to the direct rollover requirements of section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice requirements of section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code or the mandatory withholding requirements of section 3405(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-Spouse Beneficiary receives a distribution from the System, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non- direct) rollover. If the Employee's named Beneficiary is a trust, the System may make a direct rollover to an IRA on behalf of the trust, provided the trust satisfies the requirements to be a "Designated Beneficiary within the meaning of section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(d)
'Direct rollover' shall mean a payment by the System to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

The benefit shall be computed in the same manner as defined in Article IV, Section (1), considering Average Compensation at the date of termination. The benefit shall then be multiplied by a fraction (not greater than 1), the numerator of which shall be the Employee's years of Service at date of termination not to exceed twenty-five (25) years, and the denominator of which shall be twenty-five (25) years.

Upon the termination of an Employee who is not eligible for any benefit under the plan, such Employee shall receive a refund of his or her Employee Contributions, if any said contributions were made by Employee. Any Employee entitled to a Deferred Early Retirement Benefit or Deferred Normal Retirement Benefit shall not ordinarily receive a refund of Employee Contributions, if any such contributions have been made. However, should any Employee entitled to a Deferred Early Retirement Benefit or Deferred Normal Retirement Benefit request a refund of his or her Employee Contributions, if any, then said Employee shall sign a waiver of all Retirement Benefits payable before such refund is granted and shall have no other remaining rights or interest in receiving any benefits under the System.

(5)
- 7-Day Revocation Period.
Any Employee electing to Retire early under the ERIP may revoke his or her election by providing written notice of the revocation to the designated individual within seven (7) days after he or she submitted the election form (the revocation period).

(7)
- Voluntary Election.
The election to Retire and receive Enhanced Early Retirement Benefits pursuant to the ERIP shall be completely voluntary.
The effective date of this Article XI is May 31, 2015.
