The transit system advisory board members shall be appointed by the board of commissioners and shall consist of 15 persons who are county residents, serving without compensation, but who shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred on the Board's business, and approved by the board of commissioners. Each member of the board of commissioners shall appoint three individuals to serve on the board.
