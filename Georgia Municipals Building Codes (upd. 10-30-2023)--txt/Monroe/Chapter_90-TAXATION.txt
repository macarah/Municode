Continuing businesses subject to the occupational tax shall file with the city an affidavit showing all gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year ending on December 31. This affidavit showing preceding calendar year gross receipts shall be used as an estimate of gross receipts for making payments on the occupation tax for the current tax year. The number of employees reported for the current year's business operations shall be based on the number of employees employed as of January 1 of the current tax year. Applicants or owners engaged in the business shall be reported as employees of the business. The affidavit showing the business' preceding year's actual gross receipts shall also be used to adjust the estimated occupation tax for the same period. Should a business not continue or terminate during the year, such business shall notify the city's business occupation tax section and file a final return reporting those gross receipts not previously reported and making payment of any tax due.
(f)
Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the affidavit shall contain a figure that puts such part of a year on an annualized basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
(g)
In the event a business's actual amount of gross receipts in a given year are less than what was estimated, and it results in a fee difference, the business shall be responsible for submitting a written request for a refund of the difference by April 1 of the subsequent tax year; said request must be accompanied by financial support, i.e. tax return for that tax year. If the refund is substantiated, a refund will be processed within 30 days.
(h)
No refund or proration shall be made for a taxpayer who shall cease doing business or remove the business from the city.

Any lawyer failing to pay the occupation tax within 120 days after December 31 shall be considered delinquent and shall be subject to and shall pay a ten percent penalty of the amount of tax or fee due and interest as provided by state law. Such penalty shall be assessed in full on the 121st day of the year following the tax year in addition to interest on delinquent occupational taxes.

Specifically, failing to comply with the article will not result in the city closing the business or penalizing the continued practice of law by fining, imprisoning or criminalizing noncompliance.

This limitation shall only apply when the business or practitioner has provided to the city satisfactory proof as to the applicability of this subsection.
(n)
If a business or practitioner with no location or office in Georgia provides to the city proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state that includes sales or services in this state, then the business or practitioner shall be exempt from this occupation tax.
(o)
The city shall levy the occupation tax on a business or practitioner that has offices or locations in multiple locations in Georgia according to the following methods:
(1)
If the business or practitioner can reasonably allocate the dollar amount of its gross receipts to one or more of its locations or offices based on the product manufactured, sales or other services, each local government may tax the gross receipts generated by the location or office inside the jurisdiction of the local government; or
(2)
If the business or practitioner cannot reasonably allocate the dollar amount of gross receipts among its locations or offices, the business must divide its total gross receipts reported in Georgia by the number of locations or offices that contributed to those gross receipts. The business or practitioner must allocate an equal percentage of its gross receipts to each location or office.
(p)
Real estate brokers shall be subject to occupation tax pursuant to this article only if they maintain a principal or branch office in the city and based only upon gross receipts derived from transactions with respect to property listed or sold and located within the state of Georgia.

A business or practitioner that is subject to an occupation tax by another local government and claiming an exemption from or limitation to the occupation tax imposed by this ordinance shall submit documentation satisfactory to the city as to current payment of the occupation tax to the other local government and the basis of such tax.
(r)
A business or practitioner which has locations in this state subject to occupation tax by more than one local government in this state shall only be subject to occupation tax by the city for the gross receipts generated within the corporate limits of the city.

(t)
No portion of the tax may be prorated.
(u)
For purposes of determining the number of employees of a business, trade, or practitioner, an employee who works 40 hours or more weekly shall be considered a full-time employee, and the average weekly hours of employees who work less than 40 hours weekly shall be added and such sum shall be divided by 40 to produce full-time position equivalence. For purposes of this section, the number of employees shall be the number of full-time employees or full-time position equivalence.
(v)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, practitioners of professions as described in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-9(c) shall elect as their entire occupation tax one of the following:
