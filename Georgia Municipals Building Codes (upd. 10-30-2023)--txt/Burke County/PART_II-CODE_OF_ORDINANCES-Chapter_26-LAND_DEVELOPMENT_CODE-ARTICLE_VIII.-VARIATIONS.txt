ARTICLE VIII. - VARIATIONS

26-8.01.00 - GENERALLY.
The purpose of article VIII is to provide mechanisms for obtaining relief from the provisions of the LDC. Section 26-8.02.00 addresses relief through requirements regarding nonconforming development. Section 26-8.03.00 addresses relief through the grant of a variance in a particular situation due to the characteristics of the land to be developed based on the required site design standards. Section 26-8.04.00 addresses relief through the grant of an administrative waiver in specific situations.

26-8.02.00 - NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
26-8.02.01 - Generally.
It is the intent of this article to avoid any unreasonable invasions of established private property rights; however, this article recognizes that the elimination of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of the LDC is as much a purpose of this article as is the prevention of new uses that would, if established, be contrary to the purpose and intent of this article.
(a)
Within the zoning and overlay districts established by the LDC there may exist lots, structures, or uses of land which were lawfully established before the LDC was adopted but which do not comply with the requirements set forth in the LDC.
(b)
It is the intent of section 26-8.02.00 to allow these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or discontinued. It is further the intent of this section that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(c)
Nonconforming uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district where the nonconforming use is located.
(Ord. No. 18-01 , §§ 1, 2, 9-11-2018)
26-8.02.02 - Damage to structures.
(a)
A non-conforming structure or a structure containing a non-conforming use that is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, Act of God, or other cause (excluding neglect or dilapidation) to an extent of more than 60 percent of its fair market value at time of the damage or destruction shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of the LDC.
(b)
A structure that is damaged to an extent less than 60 percent of the fair market value may be restored and occupied as before the damage, provided the following standards are met: The building official may require additional upgrades to electrical system of the structure if found not to be in compliance with current building regulations.
(1)
Restoration shall be commenced within six calendar months from the date damages were incurred.
(2)
If reconstruction is not commenced within six months, the reconstruction and use of the land or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the LDC.
(c)
Fair market value, where required, shall be determined by reference to current statutory provisions pertaining to the valuation of real property for ad valorem tax purposes.
(d)
A nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use that is declared by the building official to be physically unsafe or unlawful due to neglect or dilapidation from a lack of repairs and maintenance shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
(Ord. No. 18-01 , §§ 1, 2, 9-11-2018)
26-8.02.03 - Nonconforming lots of record.
(a)
Any lot of record for which a plat or legal description has been legally recorded in the Office of Clerk of Superior Court of Burke County at the time of adoption of the LDC and was in compliance with all county development regulations at the time of recording but which fails to comply with the dimensional requirements or lot area requirements for the district in which it is located may be used for any of the uses permitted within the district by the LDC, provided that:
(1)
The minimum requirements of the district for front, side, and rear yard, open space, height, and floor area shall be complied with.
(2)
The lot is approved by the board of health for the use of a private waste water system.
(b)
No permit for the use of any lot which is substandard in terms of the provisions of the LDC shall be issued unless said lot was legally and properly recorded prior to the passage of the LDC. In all cases, construction on any substandard lot of record after the adoption of the LDC shall be required to meet all requirements of the district in which it is located.
(c)
If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of this LDC and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width, and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots may be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this LDC. A plat and deed depicting the combined lots shall be recorded with the clerk of court. An exception to this subsection (c) is as follows: any individual lot that does not meet the area requirements of the district in which it is located upon adoption of this LDC may be utilized if it meets the minimum lot size required by the department of health; however, all other requirements of the zoning district shall be met.
(d)
No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that the lot frontage or depth; front, side or rear yard; lot area; or other requirements of the LDC, are not maintained. This requirement shall not apply when a portion of a lot is required for public purposes.
(e)
Allowed modification of setback requirements. When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of the LDC, the required setback for such building shall be as follows:
(1)
Where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a nonconforming setback, the setback shall be the computed average of the normal setback requirement and the nonconforming setback, or
(2)
Where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a nonconforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two nonconforming setbacks.
