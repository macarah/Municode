DIVISION 1. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 34-401—34-450. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - NO-IDLING POLICY

Sec. 34-451. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to state the city's position regarding the idling of all city vehicles. Vehicle idling has a significant impact on the environment and consumption of resources, both natural and budgetary.

DIVISION 5. - GREEN FLEET POLICY

Sec. 34-511. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to address the management, operation, and procurement of fleet vehicles within the City of Suwanee in order to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of its fleet.
The city recognizes that:
(1)
Energy use associated with the operation of its motor vehicle fleet exacerbates local air quality problems and results in greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect the environment;
(2)
Departments have a significant role to play in improving local air quality and reducing greenhouse emissions by improving the energy efficiency of fleet vehicles and reducing emissions from fleet operations;
(3)
By improving the energy efficiency of its fleets, significant monetary savings may result in the long term.
The objectives of this policy are to:
(1)
Consider purchasing nonemergency fleet vehicles that provide the best available net reduction in vehicle fleet emissions, including, but not limited to, the purchase of alternative fueled, hybrid, fuel efficient, and low emissions vehicles.
(2)
Consider purchasing lower emission emergency fleet vehicles with comparable performance, safety, and fuel availability as compared to conventionally powered emergency fleet vehicles.
(3)
Reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a critical greenhouse gas produced through combustion of fossil fuels - make reduced CO 2 emissions a critical purchase criterion.
(4)
Reduce emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulate matter (PM)—all pollutants produced by combustion of fossil fuels that endanger public health.
(Ord. No. 2009-002, Att. A, 6-25-2009)
Sec. 34-512. - Green fleet policy.

It shall be the policy of the City of Suwanee to purchase, lease, or otherwise obtain the most practical and economical energy efficient vehicles possible that meet the operational needs of the department for which the vehicles are intended.
(b)
The City of Suwanee shall manage and operate its fleet in a manner that is energy efficient and minimizes emissions. The city shall make every effort to obtain the "cleanest", most efficient vehicle possible as measured by available emissions certification standards published by the manufacturers and by the following criteria:
(1)
The purchase of a "clean vehicle" will not prohibit or substantially diminish the specific function or intended use of the vehicle to be acquired; and
(2)
When, after analyzing the life-cycle cost, the total expenses of the "clean" vehicle do not exceed the total expense of the cheapest option by more than ten percent.
(c)
The life-cycle cost calculation shall have three components as follows:
(1)
Initial cost of the vehicle; and
(2)
Fuel—The price of fuel shall be calculated using the yearly average and by using the number of miles estimated to be driven; and
(3)
Estimated annual maintenance cost as published by the manufacturer.

DIVISION 6. - ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PURCHASING POLICY

Sec. 34-531. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to encourage consideration of environmentally preferable products and services in the City of Suwanee. By including environmental considerations in purchasing decisions, the City of Suwanee can promote practices that improve public and worker health, conserve natural resources, and minimize environmental impacts, while remaining fiscally responsible.
The City of Suwanee shall encourage the procurement of sustainable and environmentally preferred products. In general, environmentally preferable products are those that would reduce negative effects on human health and environment when compared with the competing products and services.
