Sec. 34-35. - Sound measurement procedures.
modified
(a)
Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions.
(b)
All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)
The noise investigator shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement.
(2)
Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the affected person, except when the affected party is in a multiunit residential building. In such a case the sound level is measured from any point inside the affected unit.
(3)
The measuring instrument must be calibrated using a calibrator recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each series of readings.
(4)
No outdoor measurements shall be taken:
a.
When wind speeds (including gusts) exceed 15 mph;
b.
Without a windscreen, recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer, properly attached to the measuring instrument;
c.
Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to become wet (e.g., rain, snow, or condensation); or
d.
When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the measuring instrument.
(c)
Prior to taking noise measurements the noise investigator shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question.
(d)
When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the measuring instrument shall be set for A-weighting, slow response, and the range (if the measuring instrument is designed to read levels over different ranges) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the middle of the scale. The minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values along with the central tendency average most often displayed.
(e)
The measuring instrument shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the measuring instruments manufacturer.
(f)
If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest.
(g)
The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.
