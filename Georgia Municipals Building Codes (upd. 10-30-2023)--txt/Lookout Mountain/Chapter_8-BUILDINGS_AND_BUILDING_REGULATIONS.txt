The city council, having found that there exist within the city dwellings, buildings, or structures which are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business uses, and private property within the city where an accumulation of weeds, trash, junk, filth, and other unsanitary or unsafe conditions create a health hazard or a general nuisance to the persons residing within the city, the city council hereby adopts the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17, as follows:
(1)
The definitions contained in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8 are incorporated by reference herein, and shall be included as a part of this article.

There is hereby created the office, within the city, designated as nuisance hearing officer. Such officer shall be the chairperson of the municipal planning commission of the city or such other individual as the mayor may designate. The nuisance hearing officer shall be uncompensated, and shall serve at the pleasure of the city council. Such officer shall be empowered with all the powers and authority authorized under the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17.

Whenever a request is filed with the nuisance hearing officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the nuisance hearing officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions the officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists, and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing.
(4)
If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
a.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation, and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
b.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors, without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
(5)
In no event shall the city council require removal or demolition of any dwelling, building, or structure within the city except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building, or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of this law; provided further, that a finding by the nuisance hearing officer that the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building or structure will have when repaired may be accepted by the city council without the necessity of hearing further evidence on the question; and provided further, that even if such costs shall exceed one-half of such value, the owner or party in interest shall still be given the opportunity to repair, alter, or improve the structure within the time specified by the nuisance hearing officer in order to prevent the demolition or removal of such structure.
(6)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the nuisance hearing officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The nuisance hearing officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes, or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(7)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with any order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the nuisance hearing officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of the nuisance hearing officer with regard to the repair, alteration, or improvement, or demolition and removal of such structure by the city or at its direction, shall not be exercised until the city council shall have, by ordinance, ordered the nuisance hearing officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article and of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 with respect to the particular property which the nuisance hearing officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, which property shall be described in the ordinance ordering the nuisance hearing officer to proceed with regard to such property.
(8)
If the nuisance abatement officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The nuisance abatement officer and city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(9)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
