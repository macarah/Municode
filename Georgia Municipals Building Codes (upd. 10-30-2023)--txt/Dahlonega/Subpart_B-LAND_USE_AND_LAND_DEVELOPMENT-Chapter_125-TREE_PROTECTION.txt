Chapter 125 - TREE PROTECTION

Sec. 125-1. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Basal area means the cross-sectional area of a tree trunk at diameter breast height (dbh) expressed herein in terms of units per acre.
Buffer means landscaped open space area and/or screen for buffering incompatible uses, as defined in section 680 of the zoning ordinance.
Buildable area means the portion of a lot which is not located within any minimum required yard, landscape strip/area or buffer; that portion of a lot wherein a building or structure may be located.
Caliper means a forest standard of tree trunk measurement for understory or replacement trees. Caliper of the trunk shall be taken at six inches above the ground for trees up to and including four inch caliper size, and 12 inches above the ground for trees larger than four-inch caliper.
Critical root zone (CRZ) means the minimum area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and one-half times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. Example: The CRZ radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is 30 feet.
DBH (Diameter breast height) means the standard measure of tree size for those trees existing on a site that are at least four-inch caliper at a height of 4½ feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4½ feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split.
Density factor means a unit of measure used to prescribe the calculated tree coverage on a site. Site density factor for areas within the corporate limits of the city is 20 units per acre. (See density factor analysis, the Dahlonega tree ordinance appendix A).
Development activity means any alteration of the natural environment which requires the approval of a development or site plan and issuance of a development permit. The term "development activity" shall also include the "thinning" or removal of trees from any undeveloped land, including that carried out in conjunction with a forest management program, and the removal of trees incidental to the development of land or to the marketing of land for development.
Development permit means an official authorization issued by the zoning director in accord with this chapter.
Drip line means an imaginary perpendicular surface from a tree's branch tips down to the ground. The circular area of land surrounding the tree front the trunk to the outermost branches. This area is not to be confused with critical root zone.
Hardwood tree means any leaf bearing (not needle-bearing) tree that is not coniferous (cone bearing). This definition is based on the colloquialism, and does not reflect any true qualities of the tree.
Inspector means the zoning director or his designee responsible for administering the provisions of this chapter.
Overstory trees means those trees that compose the top layer or canopy of vegetation and will generally reach a mature height of greater than 40 feet.
Revegetation means the replacement of trees and landscape materials into the minimum required landscape areas, as determined by the zoning ordinance, conditions of zoning approval, or the provisions of this chapter.
Softwood trees means any coniferous (cone bearing) tree, such as pine, fir, hemlock, cedar, etc. This definition is based on the colloquialism, and does not necessarily reflect any true qualities of the tree.
Specimen tree or stand means any tree or collective group of trees which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, type and condition. See section 125-5 for general criteria regarding specimen trees or stands.
Tree means any self-supporting, woody perennial plant usually having a single trunk diameter of three inches or more which normally attains a mature height of a minimum of 15 feet.
Tree area means an area designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving natural trees, preserving the root system of natural trees and/or preserving normal buffers.
Tree bank means an account, maintained by the finance department of the city, of funds contributed from developers as a form of alternative compliance to the Dahlonega Tree Ordinance. Funds from the tree bank are to be used solely for the purchase and planting of trees on public sites within the city as authorized by the zoning director.
Tree protection zone means all lands that fall outside the buildable area of a parcel required to remain in open space, or all areas required as landscaping strips or buffers according to the city zoning ordinance, conditions of zoning approval or provisions of this chapter.
Tree removal permit means a formal letter or permit issued by the inspector allowing for the removal of said tree on a property.
Tree species selection list means the recommended species of trees in the Dahlonega Tree Ordinance appendix B.
Understory tree means those trees that grow beneath the overstory, and will generally reach a mature height of under 40 feet.

( Ord. No. 2001-8, Amend. 1, § 20, 10-4-2004 )
Sec. 125-22. - Density factor analysis.
(a)
A basic condition of the tree protection requirements is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with the term "tree."
(b)
The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two.
(c)
For density factor analysis, the following formula shall apply:
SDF = EDF + RDF
Where:
SDF (Site Density Factor) The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (20 units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
(d)
Procedure for calculating the required tree replacement:
(1)
Step 1. Calculate the site density factor (SDF): The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 20.
Example: A 2.2-acre site has a SDF of 2.2 x 20 44.
(2)
Step 2. Calculate the existing density factor (EDF): The existing density factor, EDF, is determined by converting the diameter breast height (dbh) of individual trees to density factor units as shown in the following Table 1. These units are totaled to determine the EDF for the site.
Example: A total of eight trees will remain on the 2.2-acre site in Step 1. These trees include:
3.14-inch pines
3.18-inch oaks
0.20-inch hickory
0.30-inch oak
When converted to density factory units using Table 1, we arrive at the following values:
EXPAND
dbh Units X Number of Trees
14 inch 3.1 x 3 = 9.3
18 inch 3.8 x 3 = 11.4
20 inch 4.2 x 1 = 4.2
30 inch 6.9 x 1 = 6-9
  31.8 units total. The total units. 31.8, is the EDF (existing density factor).

Step 3. Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF):
a.
Replacement density factor (RDF) is determined by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
Example: 44 (SDF) -31.8 (EDF)= 12.2.
b.
This means that 12.2 tree units are required as replacements for the total site to meet the requirement of 20 units per acre.
c.
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in the following Table 2.
