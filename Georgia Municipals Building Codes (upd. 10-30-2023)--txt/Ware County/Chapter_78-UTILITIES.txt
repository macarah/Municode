Sec. 78-111. - Towers and antennas conditional uses; generally.
(a)
Applicability.
(1)
District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers within areas of unincorporated Ware County which are not covered by any other zoning resolution of the governing authority. Other ordinance's height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas within unzoned areas of the county.
(2)
Public property. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property shall be exempt from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority.
(3)
Amateur radio; receive only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower or the installation of any antenna that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas.
(4)
Grandfathered towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be required to meet the requirements of the ordinance from which this article is derived, other than the requirements of subsection (b)(5) and (6) of this section. Any such towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this article shall be referred to in this article as "grandfathered towers" or "grandfathered antennas."
(b)
General guidelines and requirements.
(1)
Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to:
a.
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
b.
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites.
c.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal.
d.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas.
e.
Discourage, specifically, the location of towers in residential areas and, generally, the proliferation of towers throughout the community.
(2)
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. The dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
(3)
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an administrative approval or a special use permit shall provide the planning and codes department with an inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and codes department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative appeals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority.
(4)
Aesthetic; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive these requirements if, in its sole discretion, it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby.
a.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable regulatory agencies, be painted sky blue or gray, to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
c.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
d.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(5)
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government or state government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring tower and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
(6)
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable county building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the chief codes official concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense.

(4)
The chief codes official shall respond to each such application within 30 days of receiving it by either approving the application, denying the application, or requesting further information from the applicant. If the chief codes official fails to respond to the applicant within said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed to be approved.
(5)
In connection with any such administrative approval, the chief codes official may, in order to encourage shared use, administratively waive any setback requirements by up to 50 percent.
(b)
Specific administratively approved uses. The following conditional uses may be approved by the chief codes official after conducting an administrative review:
(1)
Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other free standing nonresidential structure), as long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure.
(2)
Installing an antenna on an existing tower, including a grandfathered tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower.
(Code 1983, § 2-19-32)
Sec. 78-113. - Conditional use permit approvals.
(a)
General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits, not administratively approved.
(1)
If the tower or antenna is not permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to this article, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in this area.
(2)
Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, electrical, or radio-frequency, shall be certified by a qualified professional engineer.
(b)

(c)
Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The chief codes official shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although such official may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in the sole discretion of such official, the goals of this article are better served thereby:
(1)
Height of the proposed tower;
(2)
Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries;
(3)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Surrounding topography;
(5)
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6)
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and
(7)
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection (d) of this section.
(d)
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the chief codes official that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of the following:
(1)
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
(2)
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
(3)
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
(4)
Applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures;
(5)
The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable;
(6)
Property owners of existing towers or structure are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs;
(7)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(e)
Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the chief code official may, in its sole discretion, reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
(1)
Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 50 feet from any offsite residential structures.
(2)
Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum district yard setback requirements (where zoning applies).
(3)
Towers over 70 feet in height shall not be located within one quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 70 feet height.
(f)
Security fencing and landscaping. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. Such fence shall have a gate at least ten feet wide to allow access by emergency vehicles.
(1)
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide and eight feet high outside the perimeter of the compound.
(2)
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
(3)
Existing mature growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
(Code 1983, § 2-19-33)
Sec. 78-114. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the chief codes official notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the chief codes official may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
