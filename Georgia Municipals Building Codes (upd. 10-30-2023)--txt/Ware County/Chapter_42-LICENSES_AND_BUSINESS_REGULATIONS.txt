In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the county planning and codes department director, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against persons, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property (in the County of Ware) of the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by law. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the Ware County Planning and Codes Director in the county planning and codes department upon the property of the defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinance and law, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the county planning and codes department director against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of a nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Secs. 42-62—42-76. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 42-77. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the County, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the County. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. 2 Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
Note— The United States Supreme Court has held that nonobscene, sexually explicit materials and entertainment are protected by the First Amendment. Notwithstanding, the Court has stated that government may regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to eliminate or control the adverse secondary effects caused by these businesses. These adverse secondary effects include, but are not limited to, crime, sexually transmitted diseases, urban blight, declining property values, and lower quality of life. Enactment of legislation regulating sexually oriented businesses must be supported by factual findings of adverse secondary effects made by the enacting body.
Case Law annotation— Courts normally review content-based restrictions on speech under "strict scrutiny" review, and require government to show a "compelling state interest" for the restriction. However, the Supreme Court has stated that, because restrictions on sexually explicit speech are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, the proper level of review is whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to a substantial government interest. See County of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41, 48 (1986); United States v. O'rien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). Here, the substantial government interest is combating adverse secondary effects. If the ordinance targeted the speech itself, the test would be strict scrutiny, a burden almost impossible to meet.
(b)
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the county commission, and on findings incorporated in the cases of County of Lots Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); County of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); County of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); Iacobucci v. County of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. County of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. County of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. County of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. County of Houston, 27 F.Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex. 1998)), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Business (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the county commission finds that:
Case Law annotation— Findings may be supported by studies conducted by other cities, by the county's own study, or by findings of a court. See, e.g., County of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 296-97 (2000); SOB, Inc. v. County of Benton, 317 F.3d 856, 862-64 (8th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, it is important that the legislating body state the findings on the record prior to enactment, and note that the purpose of the ordinance is to combat adverse secondary effects. See, e.g., Peek-a-Boo Lounge of Bradenton, Inc. v. Manatee County, Florida, No. 02-12281 (11 th Cir. July 15, 2003); Lakeland Lounge v. Jackson, 973 F.2d 1255, 1259 (5 th Cir. 1992) (where (1) the drafters of the ordinance did rely upon studies of secondary effects, (2) a majority of the Commission members did receive some information about the secondary effects during an open hearing of the planning board, and (3) nothing in the record otherwise suggests impermissible motives on the part of the Commission members, the language of the preamble shows the county commission's awareness of the studies upon which the planning staff relied when framing the ordinance and reflects that a reasonable legislature with constitutional motives could have enacted the ordinance).
Case Law annotation— The Fifth Circuit has held that the studies cited in our model ordinance may be insufficient to demonstrate a factual basis for zoning regulation targeting materials for off-site viewing. See Encore Videos, Inc. v. County of San Antonio, 330 F.3d 288, 294-295 (5 th Cir. 2003). The Tenth Circuit, however, has expressly held that certain of the land use studies cited in our model ordinance are sufficient to establish the necessary factual basis for zoning regulations for both on-site and off-site viewing. See ZJ Gifts v. County of Aurora, 136 F.3d 683, 687 (10 th Cir. 1998) See also id., n.1 (citing land use studies of Garden Grove, California; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Whittier, California; and Amarillo, Texas).
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2)
Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
(3)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(4)
Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
(5)
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
(6)
At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida.
(7)
As of June, 2001, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 793,025. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.
(8)
As of December 31, 2004, there have been 28,044 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Georgia. (See statistics of Southeast Georgia Health Unit).
(9)
The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a six percent increase over the year 1999. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.
(10)
The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the 12-year period 1996-2000 was 212,672. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.
(11)
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases reported during the period 1996-2000. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.
(12)
The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(13)
According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.
(14)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(15)
Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(16)
Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).
(17)
Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir.1986).
(18)
Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. County of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11 th Cir.2000); Sammy's Ltd. v. County of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11 th Cir.1998), cent. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146 L. Ed. 2d 459, 120 S. Ct. 1553 (2000).
(19)
The findings noted in subsections (b)(1)—(18) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
(20)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(21)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the county. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(22)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments.
(23)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
(24)
It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
(25)
The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article.
(26)
The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(27)
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this county will be promoted by enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(28)
When more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the same location or business address, the secondary effects caused by such businesses are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business use is allowed to occupy the same location.
