All city property, including this handbook, must be returned at the end of employment. Otherwise, the city may take action to recoup any replacement costs and/or seek the return of city property through legal recourse. Notify us if your address changes during the year discharge occurs, so your tax info will be sent to the proper address. Our city does not provide a "letter of reference."

Sec. 2-590. - Disability.
In disability other than as a result of an on-the-job injury, the department director or supervisor, or human resources may direct any employee to be examined by a physician designated by human resources. When a disability is discovered which impairs ability to perform essential functions of a job, or impairs effectiveness of others, the following action may be taken:
(1)
If the disability can be corrected, the employee may be allowed a specified reasonable length of time as determined by the department director or supervisor to have it corrected. If the employee fails to take steps to have it corrected within the specified time, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action or termination.
(2)
If, in the opinion of the examining physician, the disability cannot be corrected, the department director or supervisor shall attempt to reasonably accommodate the employee or place the employee in another position where the essential functions of the job can be performed satisfactorily. If that cannot be accomplished without undue hardship, the director or supervisor may take steps to separate the employee from the city service through dismissal without prejudice.
