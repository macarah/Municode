For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings and catchlines has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets

Section 1. - Objectives and purposes.
The objective of this Ordinance is to establish requirements for the placement, installation and maintenance of signs in order to preserve and protect the health, safety, welfare and general well-being of the community's citizens. As the regulations of the placement, construction and maintenance of buildings and structures through zoning is a valid use of the police power, so too is the regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs, since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures, and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings. The regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by the signs' innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to its content, potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to whom a majority of the signs are oriented. Therefore, it is the intent of this Ordinance to regulate the size and location of signs such that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions. However, it is not the intent of this Ordinance that all signs are built to the maximum size. The City of Watkinsville encourages use of the minimum signage necessary to meet the purposes required.
Further, recognizing that the aesthetic, cultural and historic qualities of the City of Watkinsville are unique and, therefore, vital to the community's interest and its moniker as the "Artland of Georgia," it is the objective of this Ordinance to ensure compatibility to the aforementioned themes and to ensure that these qualities are not compromised.
Further, it is an objective of this Ordinance to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the number, size, placement, installation and maintenance of signs. The fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact grants to signs a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community.
The aesthetic impact of signs is an economic fact that can bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property; therefore, the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the community. It is contended that it is not irrational for a community's citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
It is the belief of the City that more communication is desirable during the election cycle, so that all citizens may freely express their viewpoints during the election campaigns, and therefore the ordinance allows increased opportunities to erect signs during these periods, without limiting content or favoring content in any fashion.
In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the City has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the City's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the City. The goal of this Ordinance is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner regulation. At all times, any sign permitted under this regulation can carry any message, political or non-political, commercial or non-commercial.
In addition, it is declared that the regulation of signs within the City of Watkinsville is necessary and in the public interest for the following reasons:
A.
To protect property values within the City of Watkinsville.
B.
To protect the motoring public from damage or injury caused or partially attributable to distractions or obstructions from improperly designed or situated signs.
C.
To promote the economic well-being of the City of Watkinsville by creating a favorable physical image.
D.
To eliminate the clutter of excess signage.
E.
To protect the right of citizens to enjoy the City of Watkinsville natural scenic beauty.
F.
To protect and enhance the unique aesthetic, cultural and historic attractions to tourists and thereby promote and stimulate business.
G.
To regulate the construction, erection, maintenance and size of signs that may constitute a direct danger to pedestrians and property, especially during periods of high winds.
H.
To promote the aesthetic beauty of the environment of the City of Watkinsville.
I.
To ensure reasonable opportunities for communication for all groups and interests.
J.
To preserve and promote the public health, safety and welfare in the City of Watkinsville.

Section 6[5]. - Regulations for signs.
A.
Location and Setback.
(1)
The property owner must give permission for all sign placement on the owner's property. Signs are not permitted in the public right-of-way without city permission.
(2)
All signs must comply with all side and rear setbacks of the underlying zoning ordinance.
(3)
Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures, except as noted below, must be setback at least five feet from the public right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure erected on private property shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property. Furthermore, for safety reasons, no sign erected on private property shall be located closer than 10 feet from the back of the curb of a public roadway, or if there is no curb, from the edge of the pavement.
(4)
Entrance signs must be setback from the right of way a distance equal to their height plus one foot.
(5)
Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement.
B.
Height Limits; Projecting Signs. Height limitations in this Ordinance control over the general height limitations of this Ordinance, and apply to any structure that contains a sign. For example, a church spire or radio antenna with a sign would be subject to the height limitations of this Ordinance, rather than general height limitations. Height limitations apply to both the sign and the sign structure, whichever is the tallest. Awning, mansard and marquee signs shall be no less than eight (8) feet above the ground when erected over pedestrian walkways at the lowest extremity of the sign. Wall and projecting signs shall be securely fastened to the building surface. These signs may project from the building a maximum of four (4) feet including brackets; provided that, if they project more than twelve (12) inches from the building surface, they shall be no less than eight (8) feet above the level of the ground or pavement when erected over pedestrian walkways at the lowest extremity of the sign.
C.
Number. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, ground signs shall be equal to the number of sign structures. All other non-ground signs shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in random manner without organized relationship of elements, such elements shall be considered to be a single sign.
D.
Illumination.
(1)
All signs may be internally illuminated (i.e., contain the light source within the sign). External illumination (i.e., illumination projecting onto the sign from a light fixture) is prohibited.
(2)
Other than a "time and temperature" varying electronic message, flashing, blinking or otherwise varying illumination is not permitted. No illumination that causes confusion with or distraction from any traffic signal or safety device shall be permitted. LED signs, "TV" type signs, Electronic Variable Message Center (EVMC) signs, or similar signs with changing electronic images or displaying moving pictures are not permitted.
(3)
All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow.
(4)
No lighted signs shall be constructed or maintained within one hundred (100) feet of any single-family dwelling.
E.
Calculation of Area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples:
Examples of Sign Area Measurement
F.
Unusual Shaped Signs. Unusual shaped signs are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth. For all such signs, the area is calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face, not including the base. The Code Enforcement Officer shall make a determination of what elements are included within this box. As a result, unusual shaped signs will end up with far less actual sign face than would be permitted for a square sign.
Section 7[6]. - Safety and construction standards.
A.
Official Confusion. Signs which contain or are in imitation of an official traffic sign or signal, or can be confused with an official traffic sign, are prohibited.
B.
Fire Safety. No sign or sign structure may be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, emergency exit, ventilation, or door; nor shall any sign or sign structure be attached to a fire escape.
C.
Corner Visibility. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way.
D.
Traffic Visibility. No sign shall obstruct the view of vehicles entering the roadway (i.e., the view of oncoming traffic by vehicles attempting to enter the road) or of vehicles entering or leaving driveways.
E.
Good Repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. All burned-out bulbs or damaged panels must be replaced. All sign copy shall be maintained securely to the face and all missing copy must be replaced.
F.
Temporary Sign Standards. All temporary signs shall be made of waterproof material, and must be attached to an independent mounting device no more than forty inches above ground level. The mounting must be secure to prevent the sign from blowing off the device. The mounting device shall bear the name and phone number of the party responsible for the device.
G.
Removal of Unsafe Signs and Safety Hazards. The City may remove a sign in violation of this Ordinance, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public. The City shall keep such signs for ten days prior to disposal, unless otherwise indicated in this Ordinance.
H.
Permanent Independent Mounting. Ground signs shall be securely affixed to a substantial support structure which is permanently attached to the ground and wholly independent of building support.

By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape; or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions; or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of the regulations would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such property;
(2)
The hardship or problem was not created by the property owner or a predecessor property owner, such as an illegal lot split creating a substandard lot, or other self-imposed hardship;
(3)
The variance can be granted without impairing the purposes of this Ordinance and without infringing on the rights of neighboring property owners or impairing the public health, safety and welfare.
C.
Conditions. In granting a variance, the Mayor and Council may impose conditions on the variance that they deem necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
D.
Regulations that May be Varied. A variance may only be granted as to the following regulations: sign setback, sign height, sign placement and/or sign type. The following regulations enacted in this Ordinance are not subject to variance: maximum allowable square footage of sign area, total number of signs allowed, maximum allowable total sign square footage allowed per site, and regulations that protect public safety.
E.
Variance after Denials. If a sign permit is denied by the Code Enforcement Officer based on a regulation that can be varied, as an alternative to an appeal, a property owner or sign contractor may apply to the Mayor and Council for a variance by filing a form to be obtained from the City Clerk.
