(4)
Right-of-way. A permit shall not be given for construction or alteration of a building as to affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on a street, alley, or public lane, or the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless applicant has made application for and received approval of such; it is the duty of the building official to see that street lines are not encroached on.

If work is not commenced within six months, or is suspended or abandoned for six months, the permit shall become invalid. Written extensions of time, requested in writing, not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for justifiable cause demonstrated.
