Every subdivider/developer shall consult with the administrative officer for advice and assistance prior to preparation of a preliminary plat/plan and submittal of an application for approval, as well as inquire as to the necessary documents and materials needed for a plan submittal.
(2)
The purpose of the conference is to familiarize applicants with the development process of the city and the applicable ordinances and regulations necessary to guide a development appropriately.
(3)
For developments requesting access onto state highways, the applicant should consult with and get confirmation from the state department of transportation. All projects affecting state, city or any county infrastructure (public streets, utilities, etc.) will need to be coordinated with the affected state, county, or city departments and/or authorities.
(c)
Preliminary plat stage. The subdivider must submit to the planning commission for its recommendations thereon a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the proposed subdivision abuts a state highway, a certificate of approval by the state department of transportation must accompany the preliminary plat submission. The subdivider must also furnish copies of such preliminary plat to all utility companies serving the area. The preliminary plat requires the review and approval of the mayor and council.
(d)
Construction plan stage. Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities or other improvements, the subdivider must submit to the administrative officer construction plans of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The design presented in the construction plans must be in conformance with the general design information presented in the preliminary plat that was approved by the planning commission. The construction plan must show all street design profiles, topographic information, utility construction plans, sediment and erosion control plans, and other information as may be requested by the administrative officer. The construction plan stage requires the review and approval of the administrative officer and city engineer.
(e)
Final plat stage. After completion of the physical development, or arrangements for physical development acceptable with the provisions of this chapter, of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the mayor and council, and before selling any lots, a final plat together with the required certificates must be submitted to the mayor and council for approval. The subdivider must also furnish copies of the approved final plat to all utility companies serving the area.
(f)
Recording and dedication. After the final plat is approved by the mayor and council, the final plat and appropriate documents become the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents must be presented to the mayor and council for dedication and acceptance.
(g)
Exception for minor subdivisions. Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, sewers, or water facilities, or subdivisions which do not involve improvement to existing streets are defined as minor subdivisions. They are subject only to the requirements of the final plat stage and the recording and dedication stage. Subdivisions so defined will be accepted by the planning commission and the mayor and council in the form of a final plat, and the final plat must comply in all respects to the requirements of this chapter.

A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district.
c.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district.
d.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter, the specific zoning of the property and the land use plan and will not be injurious to the general welfare of the community.
e.
The special circumstances or justifications for the variance are not the result or cause of the self imposed actions or misfortunes of the applicant.
f.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permitted by right in the overlaying zoning district or scheme of the land use plan.
g.
The variance requested is the minimum reasonable variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
(2)
Minor variances may be authorized by the administrative officer, city administrator, or designated civil engineer of the city concerning the layout of streets, lots and blocks in situations where physical characteristics of the property create practical difficulty or hardship by strict compliance of the regulations of this article. A consultation with at least three of these individuals, the developer and appropriate inspectors shall be required as part of the review process of granting a deviation in street, lot and block standards. A written report shall be followed detailing the reasons why the variance was need and why it was or was not granted. Such report shall be filed with the preliminary and final plat of the development.
(b)
All other variance requests above and beyond those mentioned in this section shall require approval from the mayor and council at a public hearing.

ARTICLE III. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 114-62. - General requirements.
(a)
Suitability of land. Land on which there is a danger to health, safety, or property must not be platted for residential use or other use that will continue or increase such danger, unless such hazards can be and are corrected. Examples of such conditions are as follows:
(1)
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion.
(2)
Land with excessive slope or other physical constraints which make it unsuitable for development.
(b)
Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the building and zoning department. The name must not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
(c)
Access. Access to every subdivision must be provided over a public street, and every lot within a subdivision must be served by a publicly dedicated street or a private street meeting the standards of a public street and approved by the planning commission.
(d)
Conformance with adopted land use plan. Proposed subdivisions must conform with the adopted city land use plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission. When features of the city land use plan, such as sites for schools, public buildings, parks, major streets, or other public uses, are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features must be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
(e)
Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard must be shown for all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical sites, and similar community assets which will add attractiveness and value to the property if preserved.
(Res. of 6-15-2004, ยง 1(app. A, ยง 501))
Sec. 114-63. - Streets.
All streets established in the city after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived must comply with the following development standards:
(1)
Continuation of existing streets. Wherever slope will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision must provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing streets into adjoining areas. Existing streets must be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width.
(2)
Street names. Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets should have the same name as the existing street. The names of new streets and roads are subject to the approval of the planning commission and must not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names, even if the suffix street, avenue, drive, etc., is different.
(3)
Development along arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on either side of the right-of-way of the arterial street to provide access to lots along the arterial street while avoiding direct driveway curb cuts on the arterial street. Such a street may either abut the arterial street or railroad right-of-way or be located a suitable distance away to allow an appropriate use of the intervening land with a nonaccess reservation along the arterial street and a buffer. In such cases, lots must have access only from the access street.
(4)
Intersections. The centerlines of no more than two streets may intersect at any one point. Streets must be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street may intersect at any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines.
(5)
Offset intersections (street jogs). Offset intersections with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet are not permitted.
(6)
Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac). Local streets designed to have one end permanently closed and not connected with any existing street, proposed future street, or not intended to extend to the property line of an adjacent tract, shall be no longer than seven times the lot width provided by chapter 118, unless necessary due to the topographic or other physical conditions of the property.
a.
Permanent. Permanent dead-end streets shall be joined by a cul-de-sac with a paved turnaround having an outside diameter of 82 feet (41-foot radius) and a right-of-way of at least 110 feet diameter. Dead-end streets designed to be permanent and that exceed more than 800 feet in length may be required to have a cul-de-sac turnaround midway between the entrance intersection and the end of the street to provide maneuvering for emergency vehicles, when the dead-end street is the only street in a subdivision.
b.
Temporary. Stub streets which are intended to provide access for which are intended to provide access for future development within a tract of land or adjacent tracts shall be required to have a temporary turnaround area having a diameter of at least 80 feet, consisting of six inches of graded aggregate base. For developments with a temporary turnaround, it shall be required of the subdivider to provide a bond or letter of credit equal to the cost of permanent cul-de-sac construction, in accordance with the standards of this section for a period of two years. Failure of the subdivider to extend the street or to construct a permanent cul-de-sac shall result in the county using the bond or letter of credit funds to complete the cul-de-sac construction. In his sole discretion, the zoning administrator may require streets within a development to connect.

(21)
Right-of-way radius. The right-of-way radius at street intersections must parallel the curbline radius.
(22)
Steep slope development. Street design and construction in areas of steep slopes are subject to variance from the development standards contained in this chapter if deemed by the zoning commission to be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter. If such a variance is ordered, the administrative officer will establish appropriate design and construction standards on an individual basis.
(23)
Grading.

The minimum right-of-way according to section 114-63 shall be dedicated along the entire frontage of the subdivision. The developer shall be responsible for all costs incurred in meeting the requirements of this section.
(3)
Right-of-way acquisition. In the event that the proposed subdivision has frontage on a road with less than the required minimum right-of-way, the developer shall contact each property owner having road frontage along the county road where the paving is to be extended and determine whether or not they desire to participate in the paving of the road and obtain such right-of-way deeds as are required by the city. If the developer cannot acquire the required number of property owners to consent, the city will acquire the necessary right-of-way through any means necessary, including condemnation. The developer shall be required to pay to the city the estimated costs for acquisition including, but not limited to, appraisals, engineers, legal fees, expert witnesses, and any out of pocket expenses incurred. The city may, at any time during the development, require the payment of additional amounts if the city determines that there is insufficient money deposited to cover the costs of completion. At the conclusion of the project, the city will reimburse the developer any excess amounts it has deposited. Under no circumstances shall development of the proposed subdivision continue until all of the required funds have been tendered to the city.

Sec. 114-70. - Surety for completion of improvements.
(a)
When allowed. Instead of completing required improvements in a subdivision before seeking approval of the final plat, the subdivider may provide surety for completion of such improvements and proceed with submitting a final plat to the planning and zoning commission for approval. The subdivider must then complete the required improvements within the period of performance specified by the government authority or forfeit the surety.
(b)
Requirements. To assure the construction and installation of required improvements, the subdivider must deliver to the appropriate city authority a certified check, letter of credit, cash escrow, bond (as defined in section 114-38(f)(2)), or other acceptable surety, whichever is specified by the government authority, in the amount estimated by government authority to be the total cost of the construction and installation of the required improvements which are the responsibility of the subdivider.
(c)
Conditions. Bonds posted or other surety provided must run to the government authority having jurisdiction over the required improvements for which surety is made. The surety must provide that the subdivider, his heirs, successors, agents, and servants will comply with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions, and requirements of these regulations, and with other laws, regulations, and requirements as specified by the appropriate government authority. If bond is offered, it must be executed by a surety and guaranty company qualified to transact business in the state.
(d)
Duration and release. Bonds posted or other surety provided pursuant to these regulations must be released, returned, or otherwise disposed of by the holder at the time facilities guaranteed have been installed and approved. Approval will be in writing and accurately describe the improvements covered. Facilities will not be accepted or approved unless they conform to the specifications and requirements of these regulations and the government authority.
(e)
Default. The subdivider will be in default of the bond if the construction or installation of any improvements or facilities by the subdivider, for which the bond is posted or other surety is provided, is not completed within the period of performance specified by the public entity at the time the surety is provided or is not completed in accordance with applicable specifications and requirements of the appropriate entity. In such an event, the entity shall notify the subdivider of the default as provided for in the bond giving it the required time to cure the default. If, after such time to cure, the subdivider is still determined to be in default, the entity shall notify the surety in the manner provided for in the bond and have all rights and remedies afforded to it thereto.
(f)
Certification of receipt of surety for required improvements. A certificate or statement of receipt of surety by the government authority having jurisdiction will be inscribed on or attached to the final plat and executed by the appropriate government authority for the required improvements for which separate surety is provided.
