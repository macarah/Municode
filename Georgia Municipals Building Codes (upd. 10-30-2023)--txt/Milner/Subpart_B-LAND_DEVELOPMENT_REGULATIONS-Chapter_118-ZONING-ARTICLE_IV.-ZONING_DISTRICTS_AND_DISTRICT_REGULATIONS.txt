ARTICLE IV. - ZONING DISTRICTS AND DISTRICT REGULATIONS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Secs. 118-101—118-128. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - A-R AGRICULTURAL-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 118-129. - Purpose.
A-R zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet areas where the primary activities are those of farming, agriculture, livestock, timber cultivation, and related uses consistent with maintaining the land resources of the city reserved for these purposes. Residences of a low-density nature which are incidental to these activities are also permitted. These districts are free from other use which are incompatible with a low-density agricultural-residential neighborhood.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 501)
Sec. 118-130. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an A-R district.
The factors contained in section 118-5 must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the mayor and council when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 502)

DIVISION 4. - P-M PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-MIXED USE DISTRICT

Sec. 118-192. - Purpose.
(a)
P-M zoning districts are intended to:
(1)
Encourage the development of large tracts of land of 40 acres or more as planned neighborhoods or communities.
(2)
Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning.
(3)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas.
(4)
Create a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of other sections of this chapter.
(5)
Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs.
(6)
Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas.
(b)
Within the planned area, a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relation to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through the application of sound comprehensive planning principles.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1201)
Sec. 118-193. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a P-M district.
The factors contained in section 118-5, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the mayor and council and planning commission when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1202)
Sec. 118-194. - Boundaries of P-M districts.
The official map (section 118-67) shows the boundaries of all P-M districts within the city. Article III of this chapter also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1203)
Sec. 118-195. - Permitted uses.
Permitted uses are as shown in the approved development plan.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1204)
Sec. 118-196. - Plan review and approval procedures.
(a)
Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a P-M district, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of a tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
(b)
Submission of application for P-M approval.
(1)
The applicant must file a petition with the administrative officer for approval of the proposed P-M district. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application:
a.
A general location map.
b.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photographic methods.
c.
The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures.
d.
The approximate location of existing and proposed streets.
e.
The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan.
f.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
g.
A legal description of the subject property.
h.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
i.
Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings.
(2)
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows:
a.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
c.
A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site.
(3)
The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use.
c.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
d.
Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development and any common or open areas.
(c)
Review and approval of P-M application.
(1)
An application for approval of a P-M district is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this chapter (rezoning). This is because P-M districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed P-M district. Upon approval of the P-M district, existing zoning must be changed to a P-M zone, which is an amendment to this chapter. The amendment procedures contained in sections 118-5 and 118-68 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the P-M district.
(2)
The administrative officer will turn over the application materials to the planning commission for its recommendations, The planning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the mayor and council stating the reasons for its recommendations (according to procedures contained in sections 118-5 and 118-68).
(3)
The power to approve an amendment creating a P-M district rests with the mayor and council. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission (section 118-5), the mayor and council will then make an official decision on the proposed P-M district. The mayor and council may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan.
(4)
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate P-M district (section 118-68). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
A properly revised site plan.
(5)
The official map will then be changed (section 118-68). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer.
(6)
No building permits will be issued by the administrative officer until the development plan has been approved by the mayor and council.
(d)
Issuance of building permits. The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations (see section 118-35).
(e)
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
(1)
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
(2)
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the mayor and council after receipt of recommendations from the administrative officer. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
(f)
Approval of P-M revoked if construction not begun. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the P-M district. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the mayor and council may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject P-M district will be removed from the official map (see section 118-68) and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated. It is not necessary to follow section 118-5 amendatory procedures for this action, since its purpose is to correct an illegal situation caused by the failure of the applicant to fulfill the conditions upon which the approval of the P-M district was granted.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1205)
Sec. 118-197. - Development standards for P-M districts.
In addition to the development standards contained in articles I and II of this chapter, the following standards are required within P-M districts:
(1)
Development plan. The approved development plan must be carried out (see section 118-196).
(2)
Density controls. The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in residential areas of a planned development must not exceed 2.2 dwelling units per net acre of residential development within the P-M district. Net residential acreage refers only to land devoted primarily to residential purposes, exclusive of other uses such as common open space, streets, and lakes. Gross acreage of residential development refers to land devoted primarily to residential purposes as well as open spaces, including private lakes within the P-M district held under individual, common, or collective ownership for the use of residents of the residential development. Gross acreage for residential development does not include areas reserved or dedicated for street rights-of-way.
(3)

Secs. 118-198—118-217. - Reserved.
DIVISION 5. - P-R PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 118-218. - Purpose.
P-R zoning districts are intended to:
(1)
Encourage the development of land as planned neighborhoods or communities.
(2)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas.
(3)
Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs.
(4)
Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1301)
Sec. 118-219. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a P-R district.
The factors contained in section 118-5, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission and mayor and council when determining whether or not the provision of a P-R district is appropriate. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city. P-R districts are permitted only where public sewage and water are provided.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1302)
Sec. 118-220. - Boundaries of P-R districts.
The official map (section 118-67) shows the boundaries of all P-R districts within the city. Article III of this chapter also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1303)

(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1304)
Sec. 118-222. - Plan review and approval procedures.
(a)
Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a P-R district, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
(b)
Submission of application for P-R approval.
(1)
The applicant must file a petition with the administrative officer for approval of the proposed P-R district. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application:
a.
A general location map.
b.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photographic methods.
c.
The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures.
d.
The approximate location of existing and proposed streets.
e.
The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan.
f.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
g.
A legal description of the subject property.
h.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
i.
Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings.
(2)
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows:
a.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
c.
A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site.
(3)
The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use.
c.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
(c)
Review and approval of P-R application.
(1)
An application for approval of a P-R district is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to these regulations (rezoning). This is because P-R districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed P-R district. Upon approval of the P-R district, existing zoning must be changed to a P-R zone which is an amendment to this chapter. The amendment procedures contained in sections 118-5 and 118-68 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the P-R district.
(2)
The administrative officer will turn over the application materials to the planning commission for its recommendations. The planning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the mayor and council, stating the reasons for its recommendations (according to procedures contained in sections 118-5 and 118-68).
(3)
The power to approve an amendment creating a P-R district rests with the mayor and council. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission (section 118-5), the mayor and council will then make an official decision on the proposed P-R district. The mayor and council may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan.
(4)
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the P-R district (section 118-68). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
A properly revised site plan.
(5)
The official map will then be changed (section 118-68). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer.
(6)
No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the mayor and council.
(d)
Issuance of building permits. The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 118-35.)
(e)
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
(1)
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
(2)
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the mayor and council after receipt of recommendations. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
(f)
Approval of P-R revoked if construction not begun. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the P-R district. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the mayor and council may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject P-R district will be removed from the official map (see section 118-68) and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated. It is not necessary to follow section 118-5 amendatory procedures for this action, since its purpose is to correct an illegal situation caused by the failure of the applicant to fulfill the conditions upon which the approval of the P-R was granted.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1305)

DIVISION 6. - R-O OFFICE-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 118-255. - Purpose.
R-O zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve districts for lower-density office activities, with a mix of certain compatible residential activities also permitted. In many cases, this district may be appropriate to provide a transition from residential uses where it is elected not to use a buffer for such purposes and where adequate space exists for such a transition area. R-O development standards require adequate yard space and off-street parking and service facilities. Permitted uses are restricted and protected from encroachment by uses capable of adversely affecting the limited character of the district.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1401)
Sec. 118-256. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an R-O district.
The factors contained in section 118-5 must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city.

DIVISION 7. - C-2 COMMERCIAL-GENERAL HIGHWAY DISTRICT

Sec. 118-282. - Purpose.
C-2 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve business areas that are motor vehicle-oriented rather than pedestrian-oriented. C-2 districts provide areas that are convenient and attractive for retail activities, business transactions, and services to the public designed primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs not only of residents of the city, but of surrounding communities as well. Off-street parking and minimum yards are required. These areas are more suburban in nature than of a downtown character.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1601)
Sec. 118-283. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a C-2 district.
The factors contained in section 118-5 must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission and the mayor and council when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the bases upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 1602)
Sec. 118-284. - Boundaries of C-2 districts.
The official map (section 118-67) shows the boundaries of all C-2 districts within the city. Article III of this chapter also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.

DIVISION 9. - M-1 MANUFACTURING-LIGHT DISTRICT

Sec. 118-336. - Purpose.
M-1 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of nonmanufacturing activities from M-1 districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.

DIVISION 10. - S-2 SENSITIVE LAND-WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICTS

Sec. 118-369. - Purpose.
(a)
S-2 is an overlay district, which applies additional standards to specific areas which may lie within any of the districts referred to in article IV, divisions 2—8. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the S-2 district, both the regulations of that district and the regulations of the S-2 district apply. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both districts, the more stringent governs.
(b)
The purpose of this district is to protect certain watersheds which are vital to area public water supplies and have a unique environmental importance to the city. This district is intended to maintain a high water quality of the surface water (rivers, creeks, streams, and springs) and underground water, and to help assure that a high quality of water is maintained in the future. The zoning for the district is intended to provide for certain permitted uses, and to protect the area from the polluting effects of more intense development and from encroachments of those uses that are not compatible with a protected watershed.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 2101)
Sec. 118-370. - Features which make land suitable for inclusion within the S-2 district.
Areas that lie within watersheds which are vital to area public water supplies and have a unique environmental importance to the city are included within the S-2 district.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 2102)
Sec. 118-371. - Boundaries of S-2 districts.
The S-2 district is delineated on the S-2 Sensitive Land-Watershed Protection Map, attached to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, copies of which are on file in the city clerk's office, which is made a part of this chapter by reference, and is used to show the boundaries of the S-2 district.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 2103)
Sec. 118-372. - Permitted uses.
