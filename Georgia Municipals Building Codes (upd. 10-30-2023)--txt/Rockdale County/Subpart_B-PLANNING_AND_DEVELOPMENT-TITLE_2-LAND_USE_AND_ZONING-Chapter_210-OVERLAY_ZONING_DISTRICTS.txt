1.
The organization is a conservation organization with perpetual existence.
2.
The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper reversion or retransfer, in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions.

Liens by Rockdale County. In the event that the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the county may assume responsibility for the maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the owner, property owners' association or to the individual property owners that make up the property owners' association and may include administrative costs and penalties.
