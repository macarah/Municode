Chapter 218 - USE REGULATIONS
ARTICLE I. - PERMITTED AND SPECIAL USES

Sec. 218-1. - Table of permitted uses.
(a)
The uses set forth in the table below shall be permitted only as listed within each zoning district and only in the manner so listed. Any use not listed in said table is prohibited in all districts. No use shall be permitted and no structure associated with such use shall be erected, structurally altered or enlarged unless the use is permitted as one of the following:
(1)
P: A permitted use.
(2)
C: A use requiring a special use permit subject to approval following the application procedures and requirements in section [chapter] 238 of the UDO.
(3)
S: A supportive commercial use that is on the same lot or parcel with a permitted use in a zoning district and established for the sole convenience of nearby residents, employees, patients, patrons or visitors within walking distance.
(4)
A: An accessory use subject to the requirements specified and generally applicable to accessory uses.
(b)
Any use not listed with the letter P, C, S, or A in a particular zoning district shall be prohibited in that zoning district, unless it is a nonconforming use lawfully established prior to the effective date of the regulation that rendered it legally nonconforming. See [chapter] section 234.
(c)
Any use listed with a "Yes" in the column headed by the words "Suppl. Reg?" in the table below shall satisfy the applicable supplemental use standards established in section 218-13 of this chapter, in addition to the development regulations of the district in which it is located.
(d)
Restrictions on the location of telecommunication facilities in certain zoning districts are provided in section 218-24.
(e)
The table of permitted uses for the watershed protection (W-P) district is provided in section 206-2.
(f)
The majority of uses listed in the table below are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Where the use is not defined in section [chapter] 106 and where the use has a NAICS code indicated in the table below, the NAICS definition shall apply. For uses that fall within more than one use category, the more detailed definition shall apply (the definition of a six-digit NAICS class usurps the definition of a five-digit NAICS class, the definition of a five-digit NAICS class usurps the definition of a four-digit NAICS class and so on). All remaining uses identified in the UDO are intended to have the commonly accepted definitions contained in the most recent edition of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

A certificate evidencing such insurance shall be provided with the application.
(c)
Signs. Special event signs shall be authorized as provided under chapter 230 of the Rockdale County Code of Ordinances.
(d)
Vendors.
(1)
Sales permitted. The sale of food or any merchandise or services of any type by a vendor shall be allowed as a component of a special event located on public property provided such vendor is approved and authorized in writing by the permit holder of the event and shall be conducted in accordance with such conditions and limitations as shall be imposed in writing by the permit holder and submitted as part of the application for a permit. Vending on private property is prohibited. Beer, wine and liquor sales, service and consumption shall be prohibited on public property, including public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way and parks.
(2)
Authorization of vendors. The permit holder of a special event shall have sole responsibility and authority to allow or disallow sidewalk or street vending as a component of an event and to designate the location and activities of such vendors. It shall be unlawful for any vendor to engage in such business on private property or at any location or in any manner not authorized by the permit holder of the event.
(3)
Identification required. Any public property vendor authorized by the permit holder shall be required to prominently display on his or her person a badge identifying the vendor as an authorized participant in the event. Such identification shall be not less than three inches by three inches, shall state that the bearer is an official participant in the event, and shall bear the signature of the permit holder of the event.
(4)
Food sales. The vendor of any food, whether hot or cold, as part of a special event located on public property shall be subject to all rules and regulations of the Rockdale County Environmental Health Department. It shall be the responsibility of the permit holder of an event to ensure compliance with this section by any such vendor.
(e)

(3)
The permit holder shall be responsible for cleaning the public property area(s) on which the event was held to its pre-event condition within 24 hours of the conclusion of the event. If the permit holder fails to clean up such areas, such clean up shall be arranged by Rockdale County and the costs charged to the permit holder.
(f)

(1)
Traffic and crowd control shall be provided by the Rockdale County Sheriff's Department and the number of officers and/or special arrangements shall be determined by the sheriff. The permit holder shall be responsible for costs associated with public safety.
(2)
A special event shall be limited to the specific geographic area(s) within which the event is to take place and the permit holder of the special event shall be responsible for the provision of sheriff and sanitation services within the boundaries of the event for a period of two hours past the conclusion of the event or until the area is cleared of all activities related to such event.
(g)
Other permits required. The permit holder shall obtain other permits that may be required by other chapters of this Code. Except as specifically authorized herein, nothing in this section is intended to authorize activity otherwise prohibited by the Rockdale County Code. Special events held on private property shall be limited to two special events per calendar year per private property location.
(h)
Indemnification. The permit holder of any special event shall hold Rockdale County, its officers, employees and agents harmless from any liability or damages for property damage or bodily injury, including death, which may arise from any acts or omissions emanating from a special event located on or involving any portion of public property. Such indemnification shall be submitted with the application on a form provided by Rockdale County.
(i)

ARTICLE IV. - TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES

Sec. 218-20. - General.
(a)
Title. This article shall be known and may be referred to as the "Rockdale County Telecommunications Ordinance."
(b)
Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to Rockdale County's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to article 9, section 2, paragraph 4, and article 9, section 2, paragraph 3, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, as well as the general police powers of Rockdale County and other authority provided by federal, state and local laws applicable hereto.
(c)
Findings, purpose, and intent. Rockdale County finds that the number, height, design, characteristics and location of telecommunications towers and antennas in the county directly affect the public health, safety and general welfare. The county finds that such structures have substantially increased in number in the county, and are likely to continue to do so in the future. The county further finds that such structures, when inappropriately located, have the potential to pose a danger to surrounding property owners and the general public, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the county. The county finds that there is substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. These regulations are designed and intended to balance the interests of residents of Rockdale County, telecommunication providers and telecommunication customers in the siting of telecommunication facilities in Rockdale County so as to protect the public health, safety and welfare and the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods and to foster, through appropriate land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunication carriers without prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services or unreasonably discriminating among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of Rockdale County in enacting this article are as follows:
(1)
Avoid locating telecommunication facilities in residential areas whenever possible.
(2)
Encourage the location of towers in appropriate nonresidential areas.
(3)
Protect Rockdale County's built and natural environment by promoting compatible location and design standards for telecommunication facilities.
(4)
Encourage placement of telecommunication facilities in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal.
(5)
Maximize the co-location of services on new and existing towers so as to minimize the need for new towers and reduce the total number of towers.
(6)
Encourage use of alternate telecommunication technologies as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers.
(7)
Minimize adverse visual effects of telecommunication facilities through careful design, siting, screening, and utilization of innovative technology.
(8)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties and personal injury from tower failure and falling ice and debris through engineering, careful siting of telecommunication structures, and other requirements.
(9)
Ensure compliance with applicable federal statutes and regulations, including the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended.
(10)
Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas.
(11)
Further the implementation of the county's comprehensive plan.

Sec. 218-23. - Requirements for all telecommunications facilities.
The following requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities:
(a)
Multiple uses. The presence of existing uses or structures on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot provided said installation is otherwise in accordance with this article IV. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
(b)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of such a facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable Rockdale County and state building and safety codes for telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Towers shall be located in a manner such that all ice-fall or debris from the tower or alternative tower structure or guy wires will not fall outside the parcel under the ownership or control of the applicant and on which the tower is located.
(c)
Regulatory compliance. All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, to the extent required by any such regulations, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
(d)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device(s) to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. All towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height.
(e)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction. If lighting is required, it shall be to the minimum applicable standard and shall be shielded and/or designed so as to minimize disturbance to surrounding areas.
(f)
Advertising. No signs shall be permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required to be posted by the FCC or FAA. Antennas added to existing structures containing signs shall not be construed as violations of this provision.
(g)
Visual impact.
(1)
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(3)
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated into horizontal or vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
(4)
The design of the buildings and related structures at a telecommunications facility site shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the telecommunication facilities to the existing natural setting and built environment.
(5)
Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be either below grade or screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(h)
Landscaping.
(1)
Landscaping shall be provided that effectively screens the view of the equipment shelters or cabinets from adjacent uses to a planted height of at least six feet and in a manner that effectively reduces visual obtrusiveness of the site. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscape strip at least ten feet wide outside the required fence. All landscaping shall be reviewed and approved by the county arborist for compliance with all county landscaping and tree regulations prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy (CO). If there is no county arborist, then the director shall designate the appropriate person to review said regulations. All landscaping shall be maintained for the duration of the facility.
(2)
Existing trees and vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible. The applicant shall provide a landscaping plan showing existing trees and vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost, in order to meet the requirements of this section.
(3)
In locations where the strict application of this landscaping requirement would not result in the minimization of visual impact, as determined by the department, the department may modify or waive this requirement in a manner that is at least equally protective of the visual impact of the tower on adjacent and surrounding properties.
(i)
Accessory uses. Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
(j)
Set backs. Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from any adjacent property line and all public rights-of-way, measured radially from the base of the tower. In addition, all telecommunication facilities, including towers, guy wires and accessory facilities, shall meet the set back and other development standards specified for the applicable zoning district.
(k)
Site integration. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses. Towers and alternative tower structures shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site.
(l)
Multiple towers. Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all set back, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. The clustering of new towers on the same parcel near existing telecommunications facilities is encouraged in situations in which the other requirements of this article IV are met.
(m)
Historic areas. Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic properties or scenic view corridors identified by the governing authority or any state or federal law or agency.
(n)
Co-location design. Any tower proposed for a height of between 80 and 100 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate two users. Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100 feet and up to 150 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least three users. Any tower proposed for a height of over 150 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least four users.
(o)
Removal requirements. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment.
(p)
Conditions. In granting administrative or special use permit authorization pursuant to this article IV, conditions may be imposed to minimize or ameliorate any negative impacts or effects of the proposed telecommunications facility on adjacent properties.
(q)
Annual reports. The owners of all telecommunications facilities operated within Rockdale County shall file an annual report with the Rockdale County Tax Assessor's Office. Said report shall be filed on or before the 31st day of December each year, and shall include the following:
(1)
Certification that the telecommunications facility is currently in use, and if not in use, the date the telecommunications facility ceased being in use.
(2)
A report from a licensed professional engineer or other qualified industry expert that the facility structure meets or exceeds all relevant federal or state requirements.
(3)
A report by a radio frequency engineer or other appropriate industry expert that the facility is in compliance with current FCC radio emission standards as well as the terms of their federal license.
