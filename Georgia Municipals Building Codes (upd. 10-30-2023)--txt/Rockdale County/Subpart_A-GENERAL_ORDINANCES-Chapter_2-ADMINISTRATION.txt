The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish ethical standards of conduct for the chairperson and the members of the Rockdale County Board of Commissioners by identifying acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the community.
The citizens and businesses of Rockdale County are entitled to have fair, ethical and accountable local government which has earned the public's full confidence for integrity. Further, it is essential to the proper administration and operation of the county that the members of the board of commissioners are independent and impartial; that public office or position not be used for private gain; that there be public confidence in the integrity of the board of commissioners; and that the public interest requires protection against conflicts of interest by establishing and adopting appropriate ethical standards to govern the conduct of the board of commissioners.
Persons best qualified to serve in positions of public trust are essential to the efficient operation of government. This article is intended to be construed to accomplish this purpose and is to be interpreted and understood so as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desires or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve.
The purpose and intent of this article, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the members of the board of commissioners in the discharge of their official duties and to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of Rockdale County's government and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflicts of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.
