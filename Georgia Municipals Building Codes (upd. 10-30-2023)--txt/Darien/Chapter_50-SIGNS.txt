Chapter 50 - SIGNS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 50-1. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The mayor and city council are enacting this chapter as a result of a workshop conducted by the mayor and council, and review by the mayor and council of the following documents: "Current Issues in Sign Regulation" paper presented at the 46th Annual Institute for City and County Attorneys on September 24, 1999; "Cities Under Siege for Billboard Ordinances" article from the February 17, 2000, issue of Georgia Cities; and "Sign Ordinance Litigation" paper presented at the Georgia Municipal Association City Attorneys' Seminar on June 25, 2000. The mayor and city council also reviewed model sign ordinances as found on the Georgia Municipal Association's web site. The findings and conclusions of such studies are expressly made a part of this chapter and incorporated in their entirety.
(b)
The mayor and city council are enacting this chapter to ensure that noncommercial messages are authorized with restriction only as to the size of such signage and to establish reasonable regulations for signage containing commercial messages. The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detrimental to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance.
(c)
By enacting this amendment, the mayor and council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Maintain the historical image of the city;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
Promote economic development; and
(9)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
