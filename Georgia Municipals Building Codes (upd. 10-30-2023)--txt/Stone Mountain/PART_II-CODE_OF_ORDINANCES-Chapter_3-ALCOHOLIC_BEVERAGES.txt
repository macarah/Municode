Action to suspend, revoke, or place a license on probation shall be commenced by the city clerk making written recommendation to the mayor and city council and giving written notice to the licensee, either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service upon licensee or his agent at the licensed location, stating the grounds therefore, and the date, time and place such matter will be heard by the mayor and city council.

The licensee may be represented by legal counsel, may confront and cross-examine witnesses, and shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence in his behalf. A hearing record shall be maintained by the city; however, either party may arrange for transcription by a court reporter at his sole expense. Hearings shall be presided over by the mayor who shall preserve order and rule upon all matters of evidence. Irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
