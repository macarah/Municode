Provide a network of connected streets with sidewalks and landscaping to facilitate convenient, efficient, and safe movement within the town center and between the town center and surrounding neighborhoods and business areas;
D.
Design streets, sidewalks, and buildings to provide an attractive and lively streetscape that encourages pedestrian activity;
E.
Integrate parks, open space, and public space into the town center;
F.
Use the placement of civic buildings on key sites to create landmarks and a strong sense of place;
G.
Provide adequate public facilities and services; and
H.
Promote quality development of attractive and cohesive design.
