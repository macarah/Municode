ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Findings.
Based on the information presented in the report entitled Summary of Findings on Adverse Secondary Effects Related to Adult Entertainment Establishments, prepared by the county attorney's office and the county department of development services, and kept on file with the county department of development services, and the experiences of the other local governments such as Indianapolis, Indiana; Bellevue, Washington; Garden Grove, California; Cleburne, Texas; Palm Beach County, Florida; and others discussed therein, the county board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact regarding the presence of establishments providing adult entertainment in the county:
(1)
Adult entertainment establishments can lead to significant negative secondary effects such as increased crime rates and increased ambient crime risk in the surrounding areas.
(2)
Allowing the consumption of alcohol in a location where adult entertainment is provided will likely exacerbate the association between adult entertainment and crime.
(3)
The location of an adult entertainment establishment in a community or neighborhood will likely lead to a decrease in property values in that area.
(4)
The negative secondary effects associated with adult entertainment establishments are present in both urban environments and in rural areas.
(5)
The negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments can be associated with all business models, including those that only provide adult entertainment for off-site consumption.
(6)
The negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments are exacerbated by allowing such businesses to cluster together.

The purpose of this section is to regulate certain types of businesses that provide various types of adult entertainment that have been shown to cause the negative secondary effects discussed above in order to limit the impacts of these negative secondary effects. This chapter does not seek to censor, prohibit, or in any way discourage the provision of adult entertainment, or inhibit any expressive conduct, but rather this chapter seeks to regulate the time, place, and manner that adult entertainment may be provided in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of surrounding communities.
