At the conclusion of the hearing required in the above subsection, the planning commission shall approve the application and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed change(s) in the appearance would be compatible with the standards of the rural village overlay zone. In making this determination, the planning commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the extent to which the proposed project complies with the design guidelines in terms of the proposed architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features proposed, the extent to which the proposal is compatible with other structures in the immediate neighborhood.
2.
In its review of all applications for certificate of appropriateness, the planning commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features, safety, or utility.
3.
The planning commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed new structure or change(s) in appearance of an existing structure would be incompatible with the standards of the rural village overlay zone. The planning commission may suggest modifications or alternatives to the proposed alteration or new construction. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit a new or revised application for consideration by the planning commission.
4.
In the event the planning commission denies an application, it shall set forth in writing reasons for the denial, and shall transmit a record of its decisions, including its findings for denial to the applicant and to the board of commissioners.
5.
If a certificate of appropriateness is denied by the planning commission, the applicant shall have the right of appeal to the board of commissioners. Said appeal shall be processed in accordance with section 605-020(G) and the decision of the board of commissioners shall be final.
6.
In cases which the application for a certificate of appropriateness involves a proposal that would require the issuance of a building permit, the denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the planning commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, and in such case, no building permit shall be issued.
7.
The planning commission shall approve or deny an application for certificate of appropriateness within 60 days after the application is filed with the building official. Evidence of approval by the planning commission shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the planning commission. Failure of the planning commission to act within said 60 days shall be deemed to be approval of the application and no other evidence of approval by them shall be needed.
