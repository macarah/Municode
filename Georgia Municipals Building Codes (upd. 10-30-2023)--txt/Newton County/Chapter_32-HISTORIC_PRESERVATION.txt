4.
Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city.

Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.
(g)

Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have submitted a written request of such notice to the commission.

The applicant, if he/she/they so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.
