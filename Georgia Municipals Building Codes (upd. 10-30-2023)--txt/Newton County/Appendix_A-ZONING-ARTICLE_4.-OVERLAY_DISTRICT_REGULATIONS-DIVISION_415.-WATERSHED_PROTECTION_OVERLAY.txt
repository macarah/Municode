DIVISION 415. - WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY

Sec. 415-010. - Scope and applicability.
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. ยง 12-2-8 and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division's Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria chapter 391-3-16, the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds establishes standards and procedures that apply to any development, use, or alteration of land or structures on any lot which is in whole or in part contained within the boundaries of the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds. The procedures, standards, and criteria apply only to that portion of the subject property within the boundaries of the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds.
Sec. 415-020. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds is to establish regulations to:
A.
Protect watersheds and drinking water supplies from activities that could degrade drinking water quality in streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.
B.
Protect water supply reservoirs from sedimentation, which would reduce their storage capacity, shorten their useful life, and reduce their drought withstanding capabilities.
Sec. 415-030. - Watershed protection overlay district.
To achieve the purpose and intent of this section, all of the land that drains to the public water supply intake is declared to be within the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds. Watershed protection areas include:
A.
Cornish Creek Reservoir (Lake Varner).
B.
Proposed Bear Creek Reservoir.
C.
Big Haynes Creek Watershed.
D.
City Pond.
The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and are drawn on the Newton County Watershed Protection Overlay District Map available for inspection during office hours in the Newton County Planning Department.
Sec. 415-040. - Use restrictions.
A.

Sec. 415-050. - Development standards.
Within the watershed, disturbance of any of the following types of land is prohibited, except for perpendicular crossings of roadways, drainage ways, trails, paths, and utility easements, as approved by the planning director based on a site plan conforming to the standards of the Newton County Development Regulations:
A.
Riparian buffers as described in section 105-020 and section 420-050;
B.
Wetlands as determined from field delineations without a permit authorized by section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act;
C.
Areas within the 100-year floodplain;
D.
Areas which have a natural slope in excess of 15 percent; and
E.
Soils with severe limitations according to the SCS soils maps.
Sec. 415-060. - Buffers.
A.
All development and disturbance of land within the watershed shall preserve a natural and undisturbed buffer 100 feet in width along the shorelines of lakes and banks of rivers or perennial streams identified on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle map. All structures, septic tanks and septic tank drain fields shall be set back a minimum of 150 feet from the shorelines of lakes and banks of rivers or perennial streams identified in the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle map. Roadways, drainage ways, paths, trails, and utility easements, are allowed to cross riparian buffers in a perpendicular manner, subject to the approval of the county engineer.
B.
A natural and undisturbed buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the boundary of any water supply reservoir.
C.
In addition to the 150-foot natural and undisturbed buffer from the boundary of any water supply reservoir, a 40-foot building setback shall be required.
Sec. 415-070. - Impervious surface.
The impervious surface area, including all public or private structures, utilities or facilities, of the entire water supply watershed must be limited to 25 percent, or existing impervious surface, whichever is greater. In order to achieve a maximum impervious surface coverage of 25 percent, all lots in the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds must be a minimum of two acres.
Sec: 415-080. - Street standards.
Within the watershed protection overlay district for small water supply watersheds, new collector and local streets may be designed using ten-foot travel lanes without curb and gutter subject to approval by the planning department. Drainage may be provided through open swale and natural filtration systems unless required otherwise by the county engineer because of topographical or engineering conditions, or in order to ensure compatibility with publicly-funded improvements.
Sec. 415-090. - Required parking areas.
Within the watershed protection overlay district, minimum parking requirements shall be reduced by ten percent for all non-residential uses. Parking spaces in excess of the minimum number required by this section shall be constructed of porous or pervious block surfaces, gravel, grass, or other materials approved by the planning department.
Sec. 415-100. - Exemptions.
The following uses are exempt from the riparian buffer and setback requirements if they meet the stipulated conditions:
A.
Legally established land uses existing prior to the establishment of the watershed protection overlay district.
B.
Mining activities. Mining activities are subject to prior approval by the Department of Natural Resources under the Surface Mining Act.
C.
Utilities.
1.
The utilities must be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible.
2.
The utilities must be installed and maintained to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible.
3.
The utilities may not degrade the quality of the drinking water stream.
D.
Forestry and agricultural activities.
1.
The activity is consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission or the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
2.
The activity shall not impair the quality of drinking water.
E.
Conservation easements. Land subject to a perpetual conservation easement at least as restrictive as the provisions of this division.
