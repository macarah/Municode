Sec. 46-1. - Purpose and findings.
The board of commissioners finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of non-commercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and to Lumpkin County's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this chapter, the board of commissioners intends to:
A.
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
B.
Further the objectives of the Lumpkin County Comprehensive Plan;
C.
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
D.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
E.
Maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of the citizens to enjoy Lumpkin County's scenic beauty;
F.
Protect property values by minimizing possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
G.
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
H.
Promote economic development; and
I.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

Sec. 46-2. - Applicability and severance.
The regulations set forth below shall apply to all the unincorporated portions of the county. Within the unincorporated portions of the county no sign shall be erected or maintained unless it is in compliance with this chapter. In the event that a court should adjudge any part of this chapter a violation of the Georgia or United States Constitutions or any other provision of law, it is the specific intent of the board of commissioners that the offending provision or provisions be stricken from this chapter and the remainder of this chapter stay in effect to regulate signs on property within Lumpkin County.
