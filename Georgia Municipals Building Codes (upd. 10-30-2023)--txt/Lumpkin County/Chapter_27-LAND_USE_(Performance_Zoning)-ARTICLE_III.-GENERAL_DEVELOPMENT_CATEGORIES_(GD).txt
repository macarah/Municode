CHAPTER 1. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CATEGORIES (GD)

Sec. 27-3.1.1 - Industrial.
Industrial land uses are important to the community, but they often have potential significant negative impacts neighboring properties and could be potentially dangerous to health, safety or general welfare located near residential development. The industrial character area is intended to address these negative impacts and land use conflicts. All industrial character areas are located within designated industrial development parks. All development within industrial parks shall also comply with the development standards of the industrial development park in which they are located.
1.
In addition to the land development requirements of the relevant industrial park, all development in the industrial character area shall comply with the following requirements:
A.
All uses shall maintain at least a six-foot-tall visual buffer between the use and all other adjacent developments.
B.
Special land use approval. Due to the likelihood of potential conflicts of land uses in this character area, the planning department will determine if a special land use approval (SLUA) is required for light industrial uses not listed on the Performance Standards Chart. Any heavy industrial use not listed on the Performance Standards Chart, may require a special land use approval (SLUA). Upon reviewing a proposed industrial use, the planning department shall make a determination if a use fits within the heavy industrial use category and provide a recommendation to the county manager who will make the final decision if a SLUA is required.

Sec. 27-3.1.10. - Gateway Corridor Overlay District.
1.
There is hereby established a Gateway Corridor Overlay District within the Gateway Corridor Character Area. This area is depicted as the Gateway Corridor Overlay District on the Character Area Map.
2.
The Gateway Corridor Overlay District is intended to be areas of focused development that promote the community vision and aesthetics described in the Lumpkin County Comprehensive Plan. These areas are the primary thoroughfare through the county and the entryway into its urban core. As such, the natural views and aesthetic character of the area must be protected from encroachment and degradation by unplanned and incompatible development. In addition, development along these areas cannot be allowed to negatively impact the free and safe flow of traffic through this area. Therefore, all new building, development, or any land disturbing activity in this area shall need to meet additional site design and development requirements, and such developments must be approved through a design review process as described in this section to ensure that it does not diminish this critical community resource.
3.
All new development in the Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall comply with the requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District Design Guidelines, including any subsequent updates that have been adopted by the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners, which are hereinafter referred to as the "Design Guidelines." That document, along with any updates, is hereby incorporated into this section, and its provisions shall be enforceable as if they were written herein.
4.
All development, whether or not a master plan is required, within the Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall meet the following requirements, unless a stricter standard is required elsewhere in this code of ordinances or by the design guidelines where those are applicable.
A.
Land uses, process, or equipment employed shall not interfere with neighboring land uses by producing odor, dust, glare, smoke, noise, vibration of an objectionable level.
B.
Metal exterior wall cladding panels are the only permitted metal that may be used as an exterior wall material (excluding architectural accents). Corrugated metal, residential-grade aluminum siding, shipping containers, and pre-engineered metal buildings are prohibited.
C.
Temporary buildings are prohibited, except those placed onsite for a construction or development project provided they do not remain onsite once the project is complete. No building shall exceed three stories in height, except where any additional height is offset by the ground level of the building being located sufficiently below the road grade of the highway to sufficiently diminish the visual impact of the building from the right-of-way, or the architectural massing of the building is designed to sufficiently reduce the visual impact of the structure.
D.
Buildings shall be oriented towards the internal access roads.
E.
Large Parking lots shall not be located between the buildings and state highways. A maximum of two rows of parking and access isle may be located between the building and state highways for the length of the building.
F.
Storm water detention facilities should be located so as to limit their visibility, and, as much as practical, they should be integrated into the landscape.
G.
All utilities shall be installed underground.
H.
All developments with outdoor lighting shall submit an outdoor lighting plan to the planning department.
1)
Outdoor lighting shall be established so that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and no direct light is cast upon them unless the lighting is specifically intended to illuminate pedestrian paths or other means of inter-parcel connectivity. It shall be designed to provide adequate illumination, but light shall not be excessive so as to cause light pollution, create a negative visual impact, or safety concerns.
2)
The specific standards for outdoor lighting plan are contained in the Guidelines for Good Exterior Lighting Plans, developed by the International Dark-Sky Association, and which is contained within the Gateway Corridor Overlay District Design Guidelines.
3)

5)
No signs shall be visible above the tree line, and are not to exceed the maximum allowable height allowed under the sign ordinance.
6)
Signs may be externally or internally illuminated.
7)
If a sign is externally illuminated, only indirect lighting is permitted, and down-lit is preferred in order to limit light pollution.
8)
All sign illumination shall be kept to a minimum light level to make the sign readable while limiting light pollution.
I.
No graded slope may be steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical. Any slope steeper will require a retaining wall. Retaining walls shall meet the following minimum requirements, though alternative designs may be approved if they adequately address the negative aesthetic impacts of the wall:
1)
The height and length of retaining wall shall be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Concrete or block retaining walls with smooth face are prohibited. Walls visible from the roadway shall be faced with brick, stone, or other architectural treatment.

J.
Retaining walls shall be located beyond any landscape buffer along any right-of-way Outside storage areas shall be subject to the following requirements:
1)
All outside storage of materials not immediately for sale must be shielded from public view. This includes the parking or storing of vehicles waiting to be serviced or repaired. All such materials shall be located to the rear or side of the building, kept inside an enclosed building or otherwise fully shielded from public view.
2)
All vehicles awaiting repairs must be currently licensed by individuals other than the owner of the property of the business.
3)
No junk or scrapped vehicles or other equipment may be stored onsite for a period longer than two weeks.
K.
Where additional technical standards are needed to effectuate these requirements and the goals of this section, the planning department may utilize specific technical requirements based on then existing professional standards and best practices.
5.
Properties in the Gateway Corridor Overlay District are intended to be developed as master planned developments that coordinate overall site design and planning to minimize negative impacts and promote efficiencies of adjacent uses.
A.
A detailed site plan shall be required for all master planned development. Master planned developments shall include any development that meets one or more of the following:
1)
Disturbs more than two acres; or
2)
Contains buildings on the site that enclose a total of more than 10,000 square feet; or
3)
Contains a building or structure that exceeds two stories in height; or

The development involves grading any existing steep slopes, which is defined as any slope with a 25 percent grade or more, or any slope that the planning director in his or her discretion determines needs a more detailed grading plan; or
5)
The planning director determines that the development is likely to have significant impacts on the community by limiting future development on nearby properties, significantly impacting the aesthetic qualities of the corridor, having significant environmental impacts, or other such impacts.
B.
Any development that is not classified as a master planned development and is not required to submit a detailed site plan may be exempted from compliance with the Gateway Corridor Overlay District Design Guidelines if it meets the requirements in section 27-3.1.10, as well as the following requirements:
1)
All buildings and other development must be screened from view from the Highway 400 and Highway 60 rights-of-way with a preserved natural buffer or vegetative plantings intermixing trees with shrubs and other plantings that reasonably mimic the appearance of a natural vegetation.
2)
The development shall maintain a 20-foot buffer from all property lines and a 30-foot landscaped buffer from all rights-of-way unless the planning department approves a smaller buffer.
3)
Where adjacent property has made provision for inter-parcel connectivity, or where the adjacent property is potentially developable, the development shall make allowance for connection with that parcel to allow inter-parcel access.
4)
Where additional technical standards are needed to effectuate these requirements and the goals of this section, the planning department may utilize specific technical requirements based on then existing professional standards and best practices.
C.
All master planned developments shall meet the following minimum development standards:
1)
Internal linkages and access shall be integrated into the total project design, including the development of public plazas, courtyards and public assembly areas scaled appropriately to the size and location of the project.
2)
Where necessary for connectivity, the development must have an access easement or other access rights to guarantee that interconnections shown on the development plan will be available to the development in perpetuity.
3)
Sidewalks or pedestrian pathways are required to provide linkages to individual buildings, neighboring properties and parking. Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials textures or color shall be provided to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety. Brick pavers or other special paving materials or overhead features shall be used to distinguish pedestrian walkway surface and areas.
4)
Site designs shall incorporate existing topography and natural character into the overall design of the project, minimizing cut and fill opportunities.
5)
A minimum of 20 percent of a development shall be maintained as greenspace, which may be landscaped or left undisturbed. Landscaping requirements shall not be counted as greenspace, except where they are part of the required development buffers. Where possible, undisturbed areas should be located adjacent to undisturbed portions of adjacent parcels to provide larger patches of forested areas and connected corridors to enhance the environmental benefits of these areas.
6)
As many existing trees should be preserved as possible, particularly any large, rare, or historically significant trees.

Sec. 27-3.1.11. - Planned Unit Development Overlay.
1.
The purpose and intent of the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD) is to provide an avenue for approval for developments of extraordinary value to the community that do not necessarily comply with the underlying requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District but which use innovate design practices that satisfy the purposes and goals of the land use regulations in this character area. A PUD approval provides greater latitude for internal site planning considerations and allows greater flexibility in design, design review, and project approval without having to resort to cumbersome and time-consuming variance procedures. Specific building location, height, type, building size, parking, signage and other limits of the underlying Gateway Corridor Overlay District may be waived provided that the spirit and intent of such requirements are satisfied within the overall development plan approved for such project.
The PUD Overlay provides for the mixing of compatible land uses; encourages imaginative and innovative design for the unified development of tracts of land; provides an alternative for more efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby resulting in lower construction and maintenance costs to the public; preserves the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within the development; and promotes land development in proper relation to the surrounding neighborhood.
2.
The specific site plan requirements and the Gateway Corridor Overlay District Design Guidelines required for the Gateway Corridor Overlay District should be the basis for a site plan submitted for PUD approval. Where a site plan for PUD varies from the requirements of the existing character area, it should be specifically noted in the site plan, and it should include an explanation as to how the impacts of that nonconformance will be mitigated or offset such that the goals for the character area are better achieved under the PUD proposal.
3.
Pre-application planning committee conference shall be required for all PUD proposals.
A.
If after reviewing the design guidelines and other requirements for development in the Gateway Corridor Overlay District, a potential applicant determines that the purposes of their development and goals of the county's land use regulations may be better served by a design that does not conform to the existing requirements, the landowner may begin the PUD review process by scheduling a pre-application meeting with the planning department.
B.
A pre-application meeting is required before the planning department will review an application for a PUD.
C.
At the pre-application meeting, the planning department staff will discuss the initial project concept with the potential applicant and offer feedback and direction to the potential applicant as appropriate.
D.
The intent of this pre-application meeting is to better inform the potential applicant of the process for a PUD approval and create an environment for a more efficient plan review process.
4.
Preliminary development plan and application.
A.
An application for PUD shall be submitted to the planning department on a form created for such a purpose by the planning department.
B.
An application must be accompanied by a preliminary development plan and application. The preliminary development plan must be prepared and sealed by a licensed surveyor, architect, landscape architect, or engineer.
C.
The planning department will develop and disseminate an official checklist for the general and technical information that must be submitted with an application for PUD.
5.
An approved development plan shall constitute the land use regulations for the site. The approved development plan and all other information, studies, plats, plans or architectural elevations submitted in the application, or required to be submitted by the planning department, at the time of approval by the board of commissioners shall establish the standards and minimum requirements for the subject property and shall become the land use regulations that apply to the subject property, regardless of changes in property ownership.
6.
Any additions or changes in the land uses, increases in square footage or density, decreases in lot sizes, changes in the location or dimensions of streets, decreases in dwelling unit floor areas, major alterations in the land use patterns, or any other changes that the planning director determines changes the intent and character of the development from what was approved shall require consideration and approval of the board of commissioners in accordance with procedures of this section. Minor changes may be approved by the planning director prior to the issuance of building permits.
(Res. No. 2022-20, 5-3-2022)
Sec. 27-3.1.12. - Gateway Corridor Overlay District application processes.
1.
Any proposal within the Gateway Corridor Overlay District will need to comply with section 27-3.1.10 or section 27-3.1.11 of this code of ordinances.
A.
If the proposal is a large development, and thus requires the submission of a detailed site plan under the terms of section 27-3.1.10(5), the submission and review of that site plan shall proceed according to the process described in section 27-3.1.13.
B.
If the proposal is a small development, and thus does not need to submit a detailed site plan pursuant to section 27-3.1.10(5), the submission may follow the process for other land use approvals outside of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District as described in section 27- 3.1.11.
C.
If a proposal cannot meet the design requirements for development in the Gateway Corridor Overlay District, but it can be demonstrated that the community's purposes and goals for those requirements can be better achieved through innovative design or other practices and that the project will provide extraordinary benefits to the community, an applicant may apply for approval as a planned unit development through the process outlined in section 27-3.1.11.
2.
If an applicant believes that a final determination of the planning department was made in error, the applicant may appeal that final determination to the planning commission pursuant to section 27-8.1.10.
3.
If a proposal does not meet the requirements of this Code, but the applicant believes that complying with the terms of this Code constitutes an undue hardship such that no significant practical or economic use remains for the property in question, taking into account all of the contiguous property under the owner's control, and that is not of the applicant's creation, the applicant may apply for a variance pursuant to section 27-8.1.2.
4.
If a proposal does not meet the requirements of this Code, but the applicant believes that this is because the property should more appropriately be classified as a different character area, the applicant may apply for a Character Area Map (CAM) Amendment pursuant to section 27-8.1.3.
5.
If under the terms of this section, a proposal requires a special land use approval (SLUA), the applicant must submit an application for a SLUA pursuant to the terms of section 27-8.1.4.
6.
The planning department and the planning commission may condition approval of an administrative or general variance on the inclusion of additional requirements that will mitigate negative impacts caused by the variance. Such conditions shall be enforceable as requirements of this chapter.
7.
Appeals of a final decision on administrative or general variance shall follow provisions of section 27-8.1.10.
