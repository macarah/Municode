Receipt of bids. No bids shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the request for bids. The purchasing department shall stamp all bids with the date and time of receipt, and shall be secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall, under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the county. Late bids shall be returned unopened to the bidder.
Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for bids. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate, shall be announced as the bids are opened.

Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
(1)
Price information; and
(2)
Any required insurance or bonding.
Withdrawal of bids. Bids may be withdrawn, only by written request, at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following:

The bidder's original work papers shall be the whole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if he elects to withdraw his bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
Bid cancellation. An invitation for bids may be cancelled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the county, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing department, or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reason for any cancellation shall be made a part of the bid file.

Sec. 2-707. - Open market purchases.
The following are guidelines for open market purchases by the purchasing department.
This shall not prohibit formal sealed bids when in the best interest of the county.
Purchases $0.01 to $999.99. The user shall use his/her judgment to source, supply, and determine the appropriate number of quotations to obtain. The user shall submit the request via the request for procurement form located on the employees only section of the county website. The user must use approved vendors.
For routine maintenance, building repairs, and planned projects, the department head or their designee may request to purchase items necessary to keep their department functioning, with prior approval by purchasing, provided they ensure funds are available in the appropriate budget line item. Purchasing has the right to substitute like items if a comparable, less costly item can be found. Purchasing also has the right to request additional justification for the expenditure. Once approved, each receiving receipt must be signed by the department head or their designee and coded to the correct line item before submittal to the finance department. A list of approved designees for each department must be on file in the purchasing department and approved by the department head.
If funds are not available, it is the department head's responsibility to make arrangements with the budget and grant analyst to transfer funds to the appropriate line item before any purchase is made.
Purchases $1,000.00 to $9,999.99. The user shall get written quotations for not fewer than three prospective bidders. (Exception: Proprietary items and sole source items.) If purchased as a proprietary or sole source item, it should be indicated on the request for procurement form, and all supporting documents should be attached. (Approval of purchases to be made by the budget and grant analyst or director of finance and purchasing prior to notification of bidders.)
Purchases $10,000.00 to $19,999.99. These typically require informal (non-advertised) sealed bids. (Exceptions: Proprietary items and sole source items) If purchased as a proprietary or sole source item, it should be indicated on the request for procurement form, located on the employees only section of the county website, and all supporting documents should be attached. (Approval of purchases to be made by the budget and grant analyst or director of finance and purchasing prior to notification of bidders.)
Whenever possible, long-term contracts should be obtained for supplying consumable commodities, such as motor oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, tires, batteries, and other items for which monthly or periodic requirements can be reasonably forecasted. Contracts or purchase agreements should extend no longer than a one year period. Any contracts for greater than one year shall meet the requirements of the O.C.G.A. § 50-5-64. The purchasing agent shall make periodic checks to assure the party under contract is not escalating his delivery price beyond current market prices.
Whenever possible, all fixed asset purchases and bids for non-consumable commodities such as office equipment and furniture, heavy equipment, and vehicles will be combined upon written request from the purchasing agent. This shall be done as an effort to obtain volume discounts and reduce costs for processing paperwork.
NOTE: Nothing in this policy should be interpreted as to limit competition. Each is to use his/her best judgment in securing all competition reasonably available. Employees are encouraged to attain competition regardless of the amount. All purchases will be from contracts when they are available.
