The county board of commissioners (board) developed this identity theft prevention program (program) pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule (Rule), which implements section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 CFR 681.2.

Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program;
(2)
Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
(3)
Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and

Sec. 2-853. - Program updates.
The county will periodically review and update this program to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the county from identity theft. In doing so, the county will consider the county's experiences with identity theft situations, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, and changes in the county's business arrangement with other entities. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, included the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the county will update the program.
(Res. No. 2009-34, exh. A(VI), 5-21-2009)
Sec. 2-854. - Program administration; oversight.
Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the county. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the county or his appointee. The program administrator position will be held by the county risk management coordinator. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the county or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The remaining positions are identified as the director of finance and the commander of criminal investigation division of the sheriff's office. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of county staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program.
(Res. No. 2009-34, exh. A(VII(A)), 5-21-2009)
Sec. 2-855. - Staff training and reports.
County staff responsible for implementing the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected.

(1)
Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and
(2)
Require, by contract, that service providers review the county's program and report any red flags to the program administrator or the county employee with primary oversight of the service provider relationship.
(Res. No. 2009-34, exh. A(VII(C)), 5-21-2009)
Sec. 2-857. - Specific program elements and confidentiality.
For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, knowledge about specific red flag identification, detection, mitigation and prevention practices may need to be limited to the committee who developed this program and to those employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may have been produced or are produced in order to develop or implement this program that list or describe such specific practices and the information those documents contain are considered confidential and should not be shared with other employees or the public. The program administrator shall inform the committee and those employees that handle sensitive information of those documents or specific practices that should be maintained in a confidential manner. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.
