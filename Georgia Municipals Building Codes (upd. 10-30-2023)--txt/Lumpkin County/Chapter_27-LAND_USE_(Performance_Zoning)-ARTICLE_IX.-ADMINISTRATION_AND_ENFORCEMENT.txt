Sec. 27-9.1.2. - Nonconforming uses.
A nonconforming use is a land use that does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, but which was lawfully established prior to the adoption, revision, or amendment of the provisions of this chapter that the use violates. A nonconforming use shall be allowed to maintain the violation of this chapter provided that:
1.
The nonconforming use shall not be changed to another use without coming into compliance with this chapter.
2.
The nonconforming use shall not be reestablished if it is at any time removed from the property or discontinued for two years or more, unless the premises are under a continuing lease but are unoccupied by the nonconforming use, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use.
3.
If a nonconforming use was lawfully established in a character area that is subsequently amended to require a SLUA for such use, the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection, and therefore the owner shall submit the plans and documentation required to obtain a SLUA.
4.
The repair or restoration to a safe condition of any nonconforming structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health shall be allowed upon order of such official and shall not affect its status as a nonconforming use.
