Laws (Act No. CCCXXII), page 372, changed the boundary between Lumpkin County and neighboring Dawson County, Georgia; however, that act has been omitted since it was repealed and the then original boundaries restored by 1875 Ga.

In some instances herein, only the portion of the act regarding boundaries has been printed and the remainder of the act has been omitted, as indicated by editorial notes. The bracketed phrase "illegible text" appearing in some of the acts herein is derived from state historical records. In compiling these acts, obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. The acts printed herein gave rise to a boundary dispute between Lumpkin County and Dawson County, Georgia. A survey of the disputed boundary was ordered by the governor by executive order dated August 9, 2005. The survey was subsequently conducted and approved by the secretary of state on December 9, 2008.
