Sec. 8-2. - ADA Service Animals Policy—Lumpkin County Facilities.
(a)
Purpose. Under the ADA, local governments must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of a facility where the public is normally allowed to go. This policy defines service animals, allows non-service animals to be in facilities for certain special events and programs, sets policy that non-service animals are not allowed in county facilities, and sets parameters for service animals as detailed by the ADA.
(b)
Definition. Only dogs and miniature horses are recognized as service animals. Service animals are not required to wear vests identifying them as such. A service animal is any dog (or miniature horse) trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. The work or task a dog (or miniature horse) has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability, such as guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, calming a person with PTSD during an anxiety attack, etc. Service animals are not required to be licensed or certified by a state or local government to qualify for protection under ADA. Search and rescue and police dogs are excluded from this policy. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.
(c)
Policy statement. Lumpkin County has an obligation to operate public facilities in a safe, sanitary manner. In order to meet this obligation, only service animals will be allowed in county facilities. Lumpkin County reserves the right to verify that an animal is truly a service animal. If it is obvious what the service animal's function is, staff are not allowed to ask any questions.
When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only two questions are allowed:
(1)
Is the dog a service animal that is required because of a disability? (Do not ask about the disability.)
(2)
What specific work or task has the dog been trained to perform? (Do not ask for documentation for the dog or ask for a demonstration of the dog performing its work or task.)
Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or some other effective method.
A person with a disability may be asked to remove his service animal from the facility if:
(1)
The dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it.
(2)
The dog is not housebroken.
When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, the individual must be offered some other avenue to obtain the goods or services needed.
Individuals using service animals may not be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals.
Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals.
Lumpkin County staff are prohibited from providing care, food, or water for a service animal.
This policy does not apply to special events and programs that may involve the use of non-service animals. Such programs and events should be reported to the county manager's office two weeks prior to the event. (An example of such an event would be the Chestatee Regional Library System's "Read to a Dog" program.)

Sec. 8-14. - Animal owner's duties and responsibilities.
(a)
Duty of owner to keep animals under control.

(3)
While on property owned by Lumpkin County, it shall be the duty for the owner of any domestic animal, or anyone having a domestic animal in his possession or control, to maintain control of the animal at all times and shall not allow the animal to create a nuisance or disturb other patrons, citizens, visitors or guests.

It shall be the duty of every owner or custodian of an animal or livestock within the county to exercise reasonable care and take all necessary steps and precautions to protect other people and property from injuries and damage which might result from the animal's behavior, regardless of whether such behavior is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness or ferocity. Every animal shall be restrained or controlled so as to prevent it from chasing vehicles or chasing, menacing, or attacking persons or other animals.

(8)
In the event an owner uses a tether to confine an animal, it shall be of sufficient construction as to not constitute abuse or a danger to the animal and shall allow the animal sufficient freedom to safely perform its necessary activities and functions in the judgment of animal control.

(10)
It shall be the duty of any animal owner or person residing with an animal owner to respond within 24 hours, or no later than 10:00 a.m. of the next business day, whichever is later, to a notice or request for information from animal control left or posted at the premises on or near where an animal is living or kept.

Furthermore, this section shall not apply to the killing or injuring of animals for humane purposes or in the furtherance of medical or scientific research or in the necessary defense of one's person or personal property.
(12)
Whoever willfully or purposefully kills, abuses, maims or disfigures any domestic animal or willfully or maliciously administers poison to an animal or exposes any poisonous substance with intent that the substance shall be taken and swallowed by a domestic animal shall be in violation of this article. Cropping, docking and dew claw removal performed by a veterinarian shall not be considered maiming or disfiguring.
(13)
Whoever overloads, overdrives, tortures, torments or deprives a domestic animal of adequate food or beats, mutilates, hobbles or kills any animal or causes such acts to be done, or carries in or upon a vehicle or otherwise any domestic animal in a cruel or inhumane manner, shall be deemed in violation of this article. This section shall not prohibit the hobbling of a domestic animal for legitimate training or approved medical care purposes.

The method used for killing the dog shall be designed to be as humane as is possible under the circumstances. A person who humanely kills a dog under the circumstances shall incur no liability for such death.

This Code section shall not be construed to limit in any way the authority or duty of any law enforcement officer, dog or rabies control officer, humane society, or veterinarian.

This section shall not apply to domestic animals which are: Inside a residence, in a proper enclosure, or on a leash and under the physical control of a responsible person. This section shall not apply if the animal has been "chipped" with microchip implant—a standard RFID (radio frequency identification device) which identifies the animal and the owner.
