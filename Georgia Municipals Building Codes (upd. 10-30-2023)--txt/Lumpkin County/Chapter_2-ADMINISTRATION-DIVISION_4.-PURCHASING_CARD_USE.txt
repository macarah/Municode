DIVISION 4. - PURCHASING CARD USE

A cardholder who knowingly uses the card for personal purchases of $500.00 or more is guilty of a felony punishable by one to 20 years in prison. Supervisors or other approving officials who knowingly, or through willful neglect, approve personal or fraudulent purchases are subject to the same disciplinary actions as cardholders.
