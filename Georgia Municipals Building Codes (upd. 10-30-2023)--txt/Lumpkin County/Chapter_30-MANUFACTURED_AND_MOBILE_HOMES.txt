Sec. 30-12. - Variances.
The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of these regulations would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant.

A variance will not be granted for a self-imposed hardship.

The planning commission is responsible for considering and making decisions on requests for variances.

b.
That these are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to be intended use of the property which do not apply generally;
c.
That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; and
