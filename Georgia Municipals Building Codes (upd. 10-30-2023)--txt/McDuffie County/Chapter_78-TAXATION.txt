ARTICLE VII. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY

Sec. 78-200. - Purpose.
This article shall serve the purpose of establishment and set up of the fire protection utility and establishment of the fire protection enterprise fund and fire protection fee.
(Ord. No. 21-04, 9-1-21)
Sec. 78-201. - Findings of fact.
The board of commissioners make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The county is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph 111 thereof, to provide fire protection service.
(2)
The county is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein.
(3)
In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-70-20, areas of the county that are serviced by Thomson-McDuffie County Fire, EMS and Emergency Management/Homeland Security Agency (collectively, TMCF) are defined in the service delivery strategy (SDS), most recently certified on January 19, 2021.
(4)
A system for fire protection provides benefits to all properties within the county and surrounding areas, through increased value and marketability, heightened use and enjoyment of the property, reduced risk to life and property due to fire, and reduced insurance premiums.
(5)
The cost of maintaining a constant state of availability, readiness and preparedness, which is the primary function of TMCF, should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services made available to the property serviced by the TMCF. Initial fire response to a particular property, and the cost to the TMCF to be prepared to provide such a response, is affected by building size, land use, and the risk (i.e. the probability and/or the consequence) of a fire occurring at a particular property.
(6)
The financing analysis and related documents prepared by TMCF properly assesses and defines the county's fire protection needs, goals, and priorities, as well as the TMCF funding strategy for delivery of those services. The professional financing analysis document entitled: Fire Fee Revenue Projection (dated July 23, 2019), Fire Fee Revenue Projection Updates (dated August 6, 2020), Fire Fee Rate Methodology Comparison (dated June 6, 2021), Fire Fee Rate Model Update (dated June 21, 2021) and applicable supporting, project-related documents are incorporated herein by reference.
(7)
Given the county's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, regulation, use, and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the county.
(8)
It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of maintaining a constant state of availability, readiness and preparedness to provide fire protection services among the owners of property in proportion to the demands the properties impose on TMCF which result in benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should correlate to the fire protection services made available to properties.
(9)
The fire protection services provided by the county include, but are not limited to: protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the county.
(10)
The most equitable means to fund fire protection services within the county is through fire protection service fee charges and other mechanisms.
(11)
Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(12)
The county reserves the right to consider the existence of privately owned and maintained on-site fire protection facilities or systems which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the county's fire protection program, and the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services, conditioned upon continuing provision of such facilities in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined the fire protection utility.
(13)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to fire protection services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of service fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the fire protection enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for fire protection purposes.
(14)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the board of commissioners hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection service fee, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the foregoing needs.

(3)
The assigned risk response factor.
(e)
The total fire protection fee for each property shall include two charges, if applicable, as described below:
(1)
Wildfire charge. This charge shall apply to all properties within the fire protection service area and shall be correlated to the cost to the TMCF to respond to wildfires, which may occur on any property, developed or undeveloped. This charge shall be based upon the total acreage of the parcel.
(2)
Structure charge. This charge shall be applied to all properties upon which any structure is built. This charge shall be based upon the square footage of all structures on the property.
(f)
To ensure that the fire service fee is reasonably correlated to the cost to TMCF to make service available to high risk properties within the fire protection service area, fire service fee charges shall be subject to a risk rate modifier, based upon the risk classification assigned to a parcel by the TMCF. A risk modifier of 2.2 can be applied to the square footage calculation for each building identified as meeting the criteria for high risk.
