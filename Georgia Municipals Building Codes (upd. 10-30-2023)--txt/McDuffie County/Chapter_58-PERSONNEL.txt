(a)
Purpose.
(1)
McDuffie County employees provide services for the residents of McDuffie County, Georgia. Part of our mission is to ensure that this service is delivered safely, efficiently, and effectively by establishing a drug and alcohol-free work environment, and to ensure that the workplace remains free from the effects of drugs and alcohol in order to promote the health and safety of employees and the general public. In keeping with this mission, the county board of commissioners declares that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispense, possession, or use of controlled substances or misuse of alcohol is prohibited for all employees.
(2)
Additionally, the purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines to maintain a drug and alcohol-free workplace in compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. This policy is intended to comply with all applicable federal regulations governing workplace anti-drug and alcohol programs in the transit industry. Specifically, the federal transit administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has published 49 CFR Part 653 and Part 654, as amended, that mandate urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions, and prohibit performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The U. S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has also published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens.
(b)
Applicability. This drug and alcohol testing policy applies to all county employees (full or part-time) when performing any county business. County employees that do not perform safety-sensitive functions are also covered under this policy under the sole authority of the county. A safety-sensitive function is any duty related to the safe operation of a vehicle, maintenance of a vehicle or equipment, public safety personnel, and any other employee who is required to hold a commercial drivers license. Maintenance functions include the repair, overhaul, and rebuild of engines, vehicles and/or equipment. A list of safety-sensitive positions that perform one or more of the above mentioned duties are provided in attachment A. Supervisors are only safety sensitive if they perform one of the above functions.
(c)
Definitions.
Accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of a vehicle or equipment, if as a result:
(1)
An individual dies;
(2)
An individual suffers a bodily injury and immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or
(3)
One or more vehicles incur disabling damage as the result of the occurrence and is transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. For purposes of this definition, disabling damage means damage, which precludes departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual manner in daylight after simple repairs. Disabling damage includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated but would have been further damaged if so operated, but does not include damage which can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the occurrence without special tools or parts, tire disablement without other damage even if no spare tire is available, or damage to headlights, taillights, turn signals, horn, mirrors or windshield wipers that makes them inoperative.
Adulterated specimen means a specimen that contains a substance that is not expected to be present in human urine, or contains a substance expected to be present but is at a concentration so high that it is not consistent with human urine.
Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols contained in any beverage, mixture, mouthwash, candy, food, preparation or medication.
Alcohol concentration means expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by an evidential breath testing device.
Canceled test means a drug test that has been declared invalid by a medical review officer. A canceled test is neither positive nor negative.
Covered employee means an employee who performs a safety-sensitive function including an applicant or transferee whom will be hired to perform a safety-sensitive function (See attachment A for a list of covered employees), and other employees, applicants, or transferee that will not perform a safety-sensitive function.
Dilute specimen means a specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are lower than expected for human urine.
Disabling damage means damage that precludes departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual manner in daylight after simple repairs. Disabling damage includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated but would have been further damaged if so operated, but does not include damage which can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the occurrence without special tools or parts, tire disablement without other damage even if no spare tire is available, or damage to headlights, taillights, turn signals, horn, mirrors or windshield wipers that makes them inoperative.
Medical review officer (MRO) means a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) responsible for receiving laboratory results generated by the drug testing program who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders, and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's confirmed positive test result, together with his/her medical history, and any other relevant bio-medical information.
Negative test result, for a drug test, means a verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite below the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 BAC is a negative test result.
Non-negative test result means a test result found to be adulterated, substitute, invalid, or positive for drug/drug metabolites. Non-negative results are considered a positive test or refusal to test if MRO cannot determine legitimate medical explanation.
Positive test result, for a drug test, means a verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite at or above the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. A positive alcohol test result means a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 BAC or greater.
Prohibited drug means marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, or phencyclidine at levels above the minimum thresholds specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.
Revenue service vehicles means to include all transit vehicles that are used for passenger transportation service or that require a CDL to operate.
Safety-sensitive functions means to include (a) the operation of a transit revenue service vehicle even when the vehicle is not in revenue service; (b) the operation of a non-revenue service vehicle by an employee when the operation of such a vehicle requires the driver to hold a commercial drivers license (CDL); (c) maintaining a revenue service vehicle or equipment used in revenue service; (d) dispatchers and (e) carrying a firearm for security purposes.
Substance abuse professional (SAP) means a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) or licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol and other Drug Abuse) with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of drug and alcohol related disorders.
Substituted specimen means a specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are so diminished that they are not consistent with human urine.
Test refusal means the following are considered a refusal to test if the employee:
• Fails to appear for any test within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, after being directed to do so by the employer;
• Fails to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete;
• Fails to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by Part 40 or DOT agency regulations;
• In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen;
• Fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure;
• Fails or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has directed you to take;
• Fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" procedures;
• Fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process);
• If the MRO reports that there is verified adulterated or substituted test result.
Verified negative test means a drug test result reviewed by a medical review officer and determined to have no evidence of prohibited drug use above the minimum cutoff levels established by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
Verified positive test means a drug test result reviewed by a medical review officer and determined to have evidence of prohibited drug use above the minimum cutoff levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40 as revised.
Validity testing is the evaluation of the specimen to determine if it is consistent with normal human urine. The purpose of validity testing is to determine whether certain adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, if the urine was diluted, or if the specimen was substituted.
(d)
Education and training.
(1)
Every county employee will receive a copy of this policy and will have ready access to the corresponding federal regulations including 49 CFR Parts 653,654, and 40. In addition, all employees will undergo a minimum of 60 minutes of training on the signs and symptoms of drug use including the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment. The training also includes manifestations and behavioral cues that may indicate prohibited drug use.
(2)
All supervisory personnel who are in a position to determine employee fitness for duty will receive 60 minutes of reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use and 60 minutes of additional reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse.
(3)
Information on the signs, symptoms, health effects, and consequences of alcohol misuse is presented in attachment B of this policy.
(e)
Prohibited substances. Prohibited substances addressed by this policy include the following:
(1)
Illegally Used Controlled Substance or Drugs Under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 any drug or any substance identified in Schedule I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), and as further defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15 is prohibited at all times in the workplace unless a legal prescription has been written for the substance. This includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and cocaine, as well as any drug not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs, and use of illegally obtained prescription drugs. Also, the medical use of marijuana, or the use of hemp related products, as which cause drug or drug metabolites to be present in the body above the minimum thresholds is a violation of this policy.
Federal Transit Administration drug testing regulations (49 CFR Part 653) require that all covered employees be tested for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine as described in Section H of this policy. Illegal use of these five drugs is prohibited at all times and thus, covered employees may be tested for these drugs anytime that they are on duty.
(2)
Legal drugs: The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported to the employee's supervisor and the employee is required to provide a written release from his/her doctor or pharmacist indicating that the employee can perform his/her safety-sensitive functions.
(3)
Alcohol: The use of beverages containing alcohol (including any mouthwash, medication, food, candy) or any other substances such that alcohol is present in the body while performing safety-sensitive job functions is prohibited. An alcohol test can be performed on a covered employee under 49 CFR Part 654 just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Under the supervisor's authority, an alcohol test can be performed any time a covered employee is on duty.
(f)
Prohibited conduct.
(1)
All covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty any time there is a quantifiable presence of a prohibited drug in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.
(2)
Each covered employee is prohibited from consuming alcohol while performing safety-sensitive job functions or while on-call to perform safety-sensitive job functions. If an on-call employee has consumed alcohol, they must acknowledge the use of alcohol at the time that they are called to report for duty. The covered employee will subsequently be relieved of his/her on-call responsibilities.
(3)
The department head shall not permit any employee to perform or continue to perform any functions if it has actual knowledge that the employee is using alcohol.
(4)
Each employee is prohibited from reporting to work or remaining on duty while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater regardless of when the alcohol was consumed.
(5)
No covered employee shall consume alcohol for eight hours following involvement in an accident or until he/she submits to the post-accident drug/alcohol test, whichever occurs first.
(6)
No covered employee shall consume alcohol within four hours prior to the performance of safety sensitive job functions.
(7)
The county under its own authority also prohibits the consumption of alcohol during lunch periods; rest breaks, split shift breaks, or anytime the employee is in uniform.
(8)
Consistent with the Drug-free Workplace Act of 1988, all the county employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of prohibited substances in the work place [or] vehicles, while in uniform or while on the county business.
(g)
Drug statute conviction. Consistent with the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1998, all employees are required to notify the McDuffie County management of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in disciplinary action as defined in subsection (q)(10), of this policy.
(h)
Testing requirements.
(1)
Analytical urine drug testing and breath testing for alcohol will be conducted as required by 49CFR Part 40. All covered employees shall be subject to testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion, following an accident, and random as defined in subsection (k), (l), (m), and (n) of this policy. All covered employees who have tested positive for drugs or alcohol on a random, reasonable suspicion, or post-accident will be tested prior to returning to duty after completion of the substance abuse professional's recommended treatment program and subsequent release to duty. Follow-up testing will also be conducted following return-to-duty for a period of one to five years, with at least six tests performed during the first year. The duration and frequency of the follow-up testing above the minimum requirements will be at the discretion of the substance abuse professional.
(2)
A drug test can be performed any time an employee is on duty. An alcohol test can be performed just before, during, or after the performance of a safety-sensitive job function. Under the county authority, an alcohol test can be performed any time a covered employee is on duty.
(3)
All covered employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing as a condition of ongoing employment with the county government. Any safety-sensitive employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be removed from duty and subject to discipline as defined in subsection (q)(3), of this policy. Any covered employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a drug test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution will be required to undergo an observed collection. Verification of the above listed actions will be considered a test refusal and will result in the employee's removal from duty and disciplined as defined in subsection (q)(3), of this policy. Refusal can also include an inability to provide a sufficient urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a verbal or written declaration, obstructive behavior, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test within the specified time frame.
(i)
Drug testing procedures.
(1)
Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment, and laboratory facilities that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS). All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The procedures will be performed in a private, confidential manner and every effort will be made to protect the employee, the integrity of the drug testing procedure, and the validity of the test result.
(2)
The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. After the identity of the donor is checked using picture identification, a urine specimen will be collected using the split specimen collection method described in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. Each specimen will be accompanied by a DOT chain of custody and control form and identified using a unique identification number that attributes the specimen to the correct individual. The specimen analysis will be conducted at a DHHS certified laboratory. An initial drug screen and validity test will be conducted on the primary urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts of the drug(s) and/or its metabolites identified by the GC/MS test are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.
(3)
The test results from the DHHS certified laboratory will be reported to a medical review officer. A medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with detailed knowledge of substance abuse disorders and drug testing. The MRO will review the test results to ensure the scientific validity of the test and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive, substitute, or adulterated test result. The MRO will attempt to contact the employee to notify the employee of the non-negative laboratory result, and provide the employee with an opportunity to explain the confirmed laboratory test result. The MRO will subsequently review the employee's medical history/medical records as appropriate to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a non-negative laboratory result. If no legitimate medical explanation is found, the test will be verified positive or refusal to test and reported to the McDuffie County Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM). If a legitimate explanation is found, the MRO will report the test result as negative to the DAPM and no further action will be taken. If the test is invalid without a medical explanation, a retest will be conducted under direct observation.
(4)
Any covered employee who questions the results of a required drug test under subparagraphs (l) through (p) of this policy may request that the split sample be tested. The split sample test must be conducted at a second DHHS-certified laboratory with no affiliation with the laboratory that analyzed the primary specimen. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the primary sample. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted at the discretion of the MRO if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. The county will ensure that the costs for the split specimen are covered in order for a timely analysis of the sample, however the county will seek reimbursement for the split sample test from the employee.
(5)
If the analysis of the split specimen fails to confirm the presence of the drug(s) detected in the primary specimen, if the split specimen is not able to be analyzed, or if the results of the split specimen are not scientifically adequate, the MRO will declare the original test to be canceled and will direct the county to retest the employee under direct observation.
(6)
The split specimen will be stored at the initial laboratory until the analysis of the primary specimen is completed. If the primary specimen is negative, the split will be discarded. If the primary is positive, the split will be retained for testing if so requested by the employee through the medical review officer. If the primary specimen is positive, it will be retained in frozen storage for one year and the split specimen will also be retained for one year.
(7)
Observed collections. Consistent with 49 CFR Part 40 collection under direct observation (by a person of the same gender) with no advance notice will occur if:
a.
The laboratory reports to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reports to the county management that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result; or
b.
The MRO reports to the county management that the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed.
c.
The county may direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty test or a follow-up test.
d.
The collector, must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if:
1.
They are directed by the county management to do so; or
2.
The collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen; or
3.
The temperature on the original specimen was out of range
4.
The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
(j)
Alcohol testing procedures.
(1)
A trained breath alcohol technician (BAT) will conduct tests for breath alcohol concentration utilizing a national highway traffic safety administration (NHTSA) -approved evidential breath testing device (EBT) operated. Alcohol screening tests may be performed using a non-evidential testing device that is also approved by NHSTA. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test must occur on an EBT. The confirmatory test will be conducted at least fifteen minutes after the completion of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using a NHTSA-approved EBT operated by a trained BAT. The EBT will identify each test by a unique sequential identification number. This number, time, and unit identifier will be provided on each EBT printout. The EBT printout, along with an approved alcohol testing form, will be used to document the test, the subsequent results, and to attribute the test to the correct employee. The test will be performed in a private, confidential manner as required by 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The procedure will be followed as prescribed to protect the employee and to maintain the integrity of the alcohol testing procedures and validity of the test result.
(2)
An employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of this policy. The consequences of a positive alcohol test are described in subsection (q)(4) and (5), of this policy. Even though an employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 is not considered positive, the employee shall still be removed from duty for at least eight hours or for the duration of the work day whichever is longer and will be subject to the consequences described in subsection (q)(9), of this policy. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 will be considered a negative test.
(3)
The county affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process. If at any time the integrity of the testing procedures or the validity of the test results is compromised, the test will be canceled. Minor inconsistencies or procedural flaws that do not impact the test result will not result in a cancelled test.
(k)
Pre-employment testing. All applicants for covered transit positions shall undergo urine drug testing prior to hire or transfer into a covered position that requires the performance of a safety-sensitive function.
(1)
All offers of employment for covered positions shall be extended conditional upon the applicant passing a drug test. An applicant shall not be hired into a covered position unless the applicant takes a drug test with verified negative results.
(2)
A non-covered employee shall not be placed, transferred or promoted into a covered position until the employee takes a drug test with verified negative results.
(3)
If an applicant fails a pre-employment drug test, the conditional offer of employment shall be rescinded. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of at least one year. Evidence of the absence of drug dependency from a substance abuse professional that meets with 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and a negative pre-employment drug test will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for the assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
(4)
When an employee being placed, transferred, or promoted from a non-covered position to a covered position submits a drug test with a verified positive result, the employee shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with subsection (q)(4), (5) and (9), herein.
(5)
If a pre-employment/pre-transfer test is canceled, the county depending on the circumstances, may require the applicant to take and pass another pre-employment drug test or may consider the cancellation as a refusal to take the test when scheduled and make the employee ineligible for the position.
(6)
In instances where a covered employee is on extended leave for a period of 45 days or more, the employee may be required to take a drug test and have negative test results prior to the conduct of safety-sensitive job functions.
(7)
An applicant with a dilute negative test result will be required to retest.
(l)
Reasonable suspicion testing.
(1)
All the county employees will be subject to a reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol test when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is impacting job performance and safety. Reasonable suspicion shall mean that there is objective evidence, based upon specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations of the employee's appearance, behavior, speech or body odor that are consistent with possible drug use and/or alcohol misuse. Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made by one supervisor who is trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use, and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Under McDuffie County's authority, a reasonable suspicion alcohol test may be performed any time the covered employee is on duty.
(2)
Supervisors should avoid placing themselves and/or others into a situation that might endanger the physical safety of those present. The employee shall be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary action described in subsection (q)(4), (5) and (9), of this policy. An employee who refuses an instruction to submit to a drug/alcohol test shall not be permitted to finish his or her shift and shall immediately be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary action as specified in subsection (q)(3), of this policy.
(3)
A written record of the observations that led to a drug/alcohol test based on reasonable suspicion shall be prepared and signed by the supervisor making the observation prior to the release of the test results. This written record shall be submitted to the county manager and shall be attached to the forms reporting the test results.
(4)
When there are no specific, contemporaneous, articulable objective facts that indicate current drug or alcohol use, but the employee (who is not already a participant in a treatment program) admits the abuse of alcohol or other substances to a supervisor in his/her chain of command, the employee shall be referred to the SAP for an assessment. The county shall place the employee on administrative leave in accordance with the provisions set forth under subsection (q)(9), of this policy. Testing in this circumstance would be performed under the direct authority of the county since the employee self-referred to management, testing under this circumstance would not be considered a violation of this policy or a positive test result under federal authority. However, self-referral does not exempt the covered employee from testing under federal authority as specified in subsections (l) through (n) of this policy or the associated consequences as specified in subsection (q)(9).
(m)
Post-accident testing. All employees will be required to undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident.
(1)
As soon as practicable following an accident, as defined in this policy, the appropriate supervisor shall ensure that an employee, required to be tested under this section, is tested as soon as practicable, but no longer than eight hours of the accident for alcohol, and within 32 hours for drugs. If an alcohol test is not performed within two hours of the accident, the supervisor will document the reason(s) for the delay. If the alcohol test is not conducted within eight hours, or the drug test within 32 hours, attempts to conduct the test must cease and the reasons for the failure to test documented.
(2)
Any employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight hours following the accident, or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test.
(3)
An employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying a supervisor of his or her location if he or she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing.
(4)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident, or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident, or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
(5)
In the rare event that the local hospital is unable to perform an FTA drug and alcohol test (i.e., employee is unconscious, employee is detained by law enforcement agency), the county may use drug and alcohol post-accident test results administered by local law enforcement officials in lieu of the FTA test. The local law enforcement officials must have independent authority for the test and the employer must obtain the results in conformance with local law.
(n)
Random testing. All employees will be subjected to random, unannounced testing. The selection of employees shall be made by a scientifically valid method of randomly generating an employee identifier from the appropriate pool of safety-sensitive employees. No employee shall be randomly tested more than twice per year. This does not preclude an employee from being tested for cause.
(1)
The dates for administering unannounced testing of randomly selected employees shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
(2)
The number of employees randomly selected for drug/alcohol testing during the calendar year shall be not less than the percentage rates established by federal regulations for those safety-sensitive employees subject to random testing by federal regulations. The current random testing rate for drugs established by FTA equals 50 percent of the number of employees in the pool and the random testing rate for alcohol established by FTA equals ten percent of the number of employees in the pool.
(3)
Each employee shall be in a pool from which the random selection is made. Each covered employee in the pool shall have an equal chance of selection each time the selections are made. Employees will remain in the pool and subject to selection, whether or not the employee has been previously tested. There is no discretion on the part of management in the selection and notification of the individuals who are to be tested.
(4)
Covered transit employees that fall under the federal transit administration regulations will be included in one random pool maintained separately from the testing pool of employees that are included solely under local authority.
(5)
Random tests can be conducted at any time during an employee's shift for drug testing. Alcohol random tests can be performed just before, during, or just after the performance of a safety sensitive duty. However, under the county's authority, a random alcohol test may be performed any time the covered employee is on duty. Testing can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of an employee's shift.
(6)
Employees are required to proceed immediately to the collection site upon notification of their random selection.
(o)
Return-to-duty testing. All employees who previously tested positive on a drug or alcohol test or refused a test, must test negative for drugs, alcohol (below 0.02 for alcohol), or both and be evaluated and released by the substance abuse professional before returning to work. For an initial positive drug test a return-to-duty drug test is required and an alcohol test is allowed. For an initial positive alcohol test a return-to-duty alcohol test is required and a drug test is allowed. Following the initial assessment, the SAP will recommend a course of rehabilitation unique to the individual. The SAP should schedule the return-to-duty test only when the employee is known to be drug-and alcohol-free and there is no risk to public safety.
(p)
Follow-up testing. Employees will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced drug and alcohol testing following their return-to-duty. The follow-up testing will be performed for a period of one to five years with a minimum of six tests to be performed the first year. The frequency and duration of the follow-up tests (beyond the minimums) will be determined by the SAP reflecting the SAP's assessment of the employee's unique situation and recovery progress. Follow-up testing should be frequent enough to deter and/or detect a relapse. Follow-up testing is separate and in addition to the random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion and return-to-duty testing.

Alcohol Fact Sheet
Alcohol is a socially acceptable drug that has been consumed throughout the world for centuries. It is considered a recreational beverage when consumed in moderation for enjoyment and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consumed primarily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a depressant, it slows down physical responses and progressively impairs mental functions.
Signs and Symptoms of Use
• Dulled mental processes.
• Lack of coordination.
• Odor of alcohol on breath.
• Possible constricted pupils.
• Sleepy or stuporous condition.
• Slowed reaction rate.
• Slurred speech.
(Note: Except for the odor, these are general signs and symptoms of any depressant substance.)
□ Health Effects
The chronic consumption of alcohol (average of three servings per day of beer [12 ounces], whiskey [1 ounce], or wine [6 ounce glass]) over time may result in the following health hazards:
• Decreased sexual functioning
• Dependency (up to 10 percent of all people who drink alcohol become physically and/or mentally dependent on alcohol and can be termed "alcoholic")
• Fatal liver diseases
• Increased cancers of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus, rectum, breast, and malignant melanoma
• Kidney disease
• Pancreatitis
• Spontaneous abortion and neonatal mortality
• Ulcers
• Birth defects (up to 54 percent of all birth defects are alcohol related).
□ Social Issues
• Two-thirds of all homicides are committed by people who drink prior to the crime.
• Two to three percent of the driving population is legally drunk at any one time. This rate is doubled at night and on weekends.
• Two-thirds of all Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related vehicle accident during their lifetimes.
• The rate of separation and divorce in families with alcohol dependency problems is seven times the average.
• Forty percent of family court cases are alcohol problem related.
• Alcoholics are 15 times more likely to commit suicide than are other segments of the population.
• More than 60 percent of burns, 40 percent of falls, 69 percent of boating accidents, and 76 percent of private aircraft accidents are alcohol related.
□ The Annual Toll
• 24,000 people will die on the highway due to the legally impaired driver.
• 12,000 more will die on the highway due to the alcohol-affected driver.
• 15,800 will die in non-highway accidents.
• 30,000 will die due to alcohol-caused liver disease.
• 10,000 will die due to alcohol-induced brain disease or suicide.
• Up to another 125,000 will die due to alcohol-related conditions or accidents.
□ Workplace Issues
• It takes one hour for the average person (150 pounds) to process one serving of an alcoholic beverage from the body.
• Impairment in coordination and judgment can be objectively measured with as little as two drinks in the body.
• A person who is legally intoxicated is 6 times more likely to have an accident than a sober person.
