These systems typically require a battery bank to store the solar electricity for use during nighttime or cloudy weather (and/or other back-up generation).
Orientation ( or azimuth) . In the northern hemisphere, true solar south is the optimal direction for maximizing the power output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. Although, systems can be oriented east, southeast, southwest, and west, while still providing 75-85 percent of maximum production, depending on the tilt.

Windows.
(5)

Pole-mount system means a solar energy system that is directly installed on specialized solar racking systems, which are attached to a pole, which is anchored and firmly affixed to a concrete foundation in the ground, and wired underground to an attachment point at the building's meter. Unlike ground-mount systems, pole-mount systems are elevated from the ground.
Power means the rate at which work is performed (the rate of producing, transferring, or using energy). Power is measured in watts (W), kilowatts (kW), megawatts (MW), etc.
PV-direct systems means the simplest of solar photovoltaic electric systems with the fewest components (no battery back-up and not interconnected with the utility) designed to only provide electricity when the sun is shining. Typical system components include PV panels, required electrical safety gear, and wiring.
Racking means securely attaching and anchoring solar energy systems to structural sections of the roof-mounted or pole-mounted systems. Specially designed metal plates called flashings prevent leaks and are placed under shingles and over bolts to create a water-tight seal.
Roof-mount system (rooftop-mounted, building-mounted) means a solar energy system consisting of solar panels that is installed directly on the roof of a home, commercial building, and/or an accessory structure, such as a garage, pergola, and/or shed. Solar panels are mounted and secured using racking systems specifically designed to minimize the impact on the roof and prevent any leaks or structural damage. Roof-mount systems can be mounted flush with the roof or tilted toward the sun at an angle.
Solar access means the ability of one property to continue to receive sunlight across property lines without obstruction from another's property (buildings, foliage or other impediment). Solar access is calculated using a sun path diagram.
Solar array means multiple solar panels combined together to create one system.
Solar collector means a solar PV cell, panel, or array, or solar thermal collector device that relies upon solar radiation as an energy source for the generation of electricity or transfer of stored heat.
Solar easement means an easement recorded pursuant to O.C.G.A. ยง 44-9-20 et seq., the purpose of which is to secure the right to receive sunlight across the real property of another for the continued access to sunlight necessary to operate a solar energy system.
Solar energy system means a system capable of collecting and converting solar radiation into heat or mechanical or electrical energy, and transferring these forms of energy by a separate apparatus to storage or to a point of use, including, but not limited to, water heating, space heating or cooling, electric energy generation, or mechanical energy generation. The term "solar energy system" shall include solar thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar systems.
Solar glare means the potential for solar panels to reflect sunlight, with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
Solar panel (or module) means a device for the direct conversion of sunlight into useable solar energy (including electricity or heat).
Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) systems means solar systems consisting of photovoltaic cells, made with semiconducting materials, that produce electricity (in the form of direct current) when they are exposed to sunlight. A typical PV system consists of PV panels (or modules) that combine to form an array; other system components may include mounting racks and hardware, wiring for electrical connections, and power conditioning equipment, such as an inverter and/or batteries. For the purposes of this article, a solar PV system is defined as generating capacity of not more than 25 kilowatts for residential facilities, and not more than two megawatts for nonresidential facilities.
Solar process heat means technologies that provide industrial specific applications, including ventilation air preheating, solar process heating, and solar cooling.
Solar-ready means the concept of planning and building with the purpose of enabling future use of solar energy generation systems. Solar-ready buildings, lots, and developments make it easier and more cost-effective to utilize passive solar techniques and adopt active solar technologies in the future. Solar-ready buildings are built anticipating future installation of active solar energy systems (including structural reinforcement, pre-wiring or plumbing for solar, and east-west building orientation). Solar-ready lots are oriented to take maximal advantage of a location's solar resource. Solar-ready developments expand this concept to entire subdivisions.
Solar thermal system (solar hot water or solar heating systems) means a solar energy system that directly heats water or other liquid using sunlight. A solar thermal system consists of a series of tubes that concentrate light to heat either water or a heat-transfer fluid (such as food-grade propylene glycol, a nontoxic substance) in one of two types of collectors (flat-plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors). The heated liquid is used for such purposes as space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and heating pool water.
Thin film solar PV means thin film solar PV cells capable of generating electricity from the sun, consisting of layers of semiconductor materials (made from amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium diselenide, among other materials) a few micrometers thick, which allow for greater flexibility. Thin film is made by depositing one or more thin layers of photovoltaic material on a substrate; products include rooftop shingles and tiles, building facades, the glazing for skylights, and other building integrated materials.
Tilt means the angle of the solar panels and/or solar collector relative to their latitude. The optimal tilt to maximize solar production is perpendicular, or 90 degrees, to the sun's rays at true solar noon. True solar noon is when the sun is at its highest during its daily east-west path across the sky (this is also known as 0 degrees azimuth). Solar energy systems can be manually or automatically adjusted throughout the year. Alternatively, fixed-tilt systems remain at a static tilt year-round
Watts (W) means a measure of the use of electrical power (power (watts) = voltage (volts) X current (amps)).
Wiring. Specified by electrical codes, solar PV system wires are routed from the panels or micro-inverters through conduit into the inverter and buildings meter.
