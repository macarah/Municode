Editor's note— Ord. of 7-18-2022 amended Ch. 6.04 to read as herein set out. At the editor's discretion, some provisions were renumbered to facilitate inclusion and organization of subject matter. The historical notation has been retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes. The former Ch. 6.04, §§ 6.04.010—6.04.170, pertained to dogs and derived from Ord. dated 4-11-05 §§ 1—15.

6.04.010 - Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the humane treatment of dogs by regulating the case and control of animals within the city and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. This chapter sets forth necessary controls on the unrestrained activities of animals which threaten the safety and pleasantness of streets, parks, sidewalks, yards and all areas of the city; and the lack of knowledge or intent is not a defense in the violation of this chapter.
