The Georgia General Assembly established guidelines and penalties into the Official Code of Georgia Annotated ("O.C.G.A.") which provides that no municipal corporation shall issue government purchasing cards or government credit cards to elected officials on or after January 1, 2016, until the governing authority of the municipal corporation, by public vote, has authorized the issuance and has promulgated specific policies regarding the use of such government purchasing cards or government credit cards for elected officials of such municipal corporation.
(Ord. of 9-21-17, § A; Ord. of 1-19-16)
2.54.020 - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City of Metter, Georgia Purchasing Card Program. The policy is not intended to replace current State of Georgia statutes but is intended to comply with such state laws and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials using such purchasing cards. At no time should a city issued purchasing card or credit card be used for personal purchases regardless of the circumstances. Utilizing the purchasing card or credit card for personal use or for any item or service not directly related to such official's public duty may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, felony criminal prosecution and immediate termination. All purchases utilizing a government purchasing card or government credit card must be in accordance with these guidelines and with state law.
