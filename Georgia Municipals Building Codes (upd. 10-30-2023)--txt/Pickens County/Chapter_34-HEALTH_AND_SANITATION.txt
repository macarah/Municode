DIVISION 2. - PERMIT AND INSPECTION

Sec. 34-100. - Title.
This division shall be known as the On-Site Wastewater Disposal Ordinance of Pickens County.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 4)
Sec. 34-101. - Purpose.
In order to insure Pickens County meets the requirements and regulations set forth in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Pickens County has determined that the only way to ascertain that these requirements are met without placing additional hardships and regulations on property owners is to require an on-site approval and sewage disposal permit, and the only way to effectively determine if a violation of the requirement of an on-site approval has occurred is to prohibit the health department from issuing a sewage disposal system permit to any property owner unless an application has been made to said department.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 4)
Sec. 34-102. - Site approval and sewage disposal permit requirement.
No person or business shall construct an on-site wastewater disposal apparatus on property until the property owner obtains a site approval and sewage disposal construction permit from the Pickens County Health Department.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 4)
Sec. 34-103. - Site approval and sewage disposal permit procedure.
(1)
Application for the site approval and sewage disposal construction permit shall be made be filing application forms provided by the Pickens County Health Department.
(2)
Such application shall be made at least ten days prior to the application for a building permit or beginning construction of an individual sewage disposal system.
(3)
The site approval and sewage disposal system shall be based upon requirements of the Georgia State Rules and Regulations for Individual Sewage Disposal Systems, Chapter 270, pages 5-25, adopted under Georgia Laws (Acts 1964, pages 449, 501), § 31-3-5 and 31-3-5.1 Office Code of Georgia, as amended.
(4)
In addition to duties set forth hereinabove, the county health officer shall also perform an inspection of each property which has applied for a new on-site wastewater treatment apparatus for the potential of construction activities to negatively impact jurisdictional wetlands protected by federal law (§ 404 of the Clean Water Act). For reference purposes, copies of the most recent National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Maps shall be maintained at the Land Development Office of Pickens County. Said maps shall be the official reference materials utilized in determining the location of wetland habitats throughout Pickens County. If it is determined by the county health officer that there is potential for detrimental impacts to said wetland habitats as a result of new construction, the county health officer shall refer the applicant to the nearest office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers where property permit applications for wetland alternations can be obtained. In such event the county health officer shall withhold the on-site wastewater disposal permit until the applicant documents property inquiry with and approval by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If it is determined by the county health officer that no detrimental wetland impact will occur, it is within said official's discretion to issue the appropriate permits if the site meets all other pertinent requirements.
(5)
Nothing contained in this article shall relieve the landowner of complying with the Wetlands Protection Ordinance of Pickens County (sections 26-121—26-127).
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 4; Res. of 12-29-2000, § 2)
Sec. 34-104. - Penalties.
A violation of this division shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000. All alleged violations shall be tried in the Magistrate Court of Pickens County.

ARTICLE IV. - DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH—MINIMUM LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-SITE SEWAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Sec. 34-321. - Purpose.
To provide for the orderly and safe development of properties and creation of new lots, whether residential or commercial, utilizing on-site sewage management systems the following criteria for establishing minimum lot sizes are established for use by the Pickens County Board of Health as authorized by Georgia statute in O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5 to establish minimum lot sizes and other powers. Larger lot sizes may be required to meet these requirements depending on the proposed development of properties and their physical characteristics.
County planning and zoning authorities may require larger minimum lot sizes than established herein; such establishment of larger minimum lot sizes will take precedence.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-322. - Definitions and criteria.
Absorption field areas are defined as a minimum of 4,000 square feet useable soils area per bedroom (2,500 square feet per bedroom for initial absorption field plus 2,000 square feet per bedroom for replacement absorption field), or a minimum of 4,000 square feet useable soils per 150 gallons per day of wastewater for commercial and similar structures; these areas may be considered for reduction in size by installing both the initial and replacement absorption fields at the same time, but in no case shall the replacement area be smaller than required for a conventional absorption field system. Where position of structures, width of lots, slope or other characteristics of properties will make future access for replacement or repair of systems very difficult or impossible, both the initial absorption fields and replacement absorption fields will be installed at the same time. Complex slope patterns dissected by rock, deep gullies and ravines are not acceptable for absorption field areas. If larger homes, more bedrooms, swimming pools, tennis courts, outbuildings and other appurtenances are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Pickens County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure useable soil areas. Absorption field areas must remain undisturbed until septic system installation except for clearing of trees and underbrush; no unapproved grading or similar disturbance of soils is permitted except for foundation footings and other activities associated with home construction.
Conventional absorption field system means a traditionally used on-site sewage management system whose absorption field is composed of perforated pipe surrounded by gravel or stone.
Commercial lot means real estate property that is used for business activities whether or not for profit.
GPAD means gallons of sewage effluent applied per acre per day through on-site sewage management absorption fields.
Individual water supply system means a system of piping, pumps, tanks or other facilities utilizing groundwater to supply a single-family dwelling.
Lot means a portion of a subdivision or any other parcel of land, intended as a unit for transfer of ownership, or for development, or both, and shall not include any part of the right-of-way of a street or road. The following land areas are not considered as a part of any lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line, pipe line, other utility or adjacent property egress) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland, springhead not used for drinking water, or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Maximum daily sewage flow means 600 GPAD when a lot is served by an individual water supply system, and 1,200 GPAD when served by a public water supply system.
Multi-residential means a classification of housing where multiple separate housing units for residential inhabitants are contained within one building or several buildings within one complex and piece of property. A common form is an apartment building or condominium. This definition does not include two-family structures (duplex) or two separate family residential structures on one property.
Onsite sewage management system means a sewage management system other than a public or community sewage treatment system, whether serving single or multiple buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, residences or other facilities designed or used for human occupancy or congregation. It includes conventional septic tank systems and privies, as well as alternative onsite sewage management systems approved by the local health authority.
On-site wastewater treatment system means an advanced alternative wastewater treatment system approved by the state department of public health and that produces an effluent meeting the current ANSI/NSF Standard No. 40 for Residential Wastewater Treatment Systems.
Other lots mean properties not used for family residential, commercial or family multi-residential purposes and may include institutions, schools, camps, churches, rehabilitation or treatment operations, transient facilities and similar.
Percolation rate is defined as the time, expressed in minutes per inch, required for water to seep into unsaturated soil at a constant rate.
Public water supply system means a system for the provision of piped water to the public for human consumption, if such system has at least 15 service connections, or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily, at least 60 days out of the year as regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Georgia Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5.
Slope is defined as the vertical distance, or difference in height, between two points on the ground surface divided by the horizontal distance between these two points expressed as a percentage. The Pickens County Board of Health recognizes that a lot may have different slopes in different areas with varying topography; in this context, the size of a lot is determined by the slope where the initial absorption field and replacement field areas are likely to be or can be located. In questionable circumstances the larger lot size shall be required.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-323. - Required sizes for new residential lots.
These minimum lot sizes are intended for homes of 3,000 square feet or less with five bedrooms or less with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, decks, porches and water supply line. If larger homes, more bedrooms, swimming pools, tennis courts, outbuildings and other appurtenances are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Pickens County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure useable soil area.
New residential lots outside conservation subdivisions shall have minimum lot sizes per single-family and two-family unit use, in square feet, as follows:
(1)
With single family structure, public water supply system and on-site sewage management system: 43,560 square feet (one acre). Two family structure, or two separate structures: 87,120 square feet (two acres.)
(2)
With single family structure, individual water supply system and on-site sewage management system: 65,340 square feet (one and a half acres). Two family structure, or two separate structures: 130,680 square feet (three acres).
(3)
All residential lots located above 2,200 feet sea level: 435,600 square feet (ten acres) in accordance with county land use ordinances.
(4)
All residential lots below 2,200 feet sea level, with greater than 25 percent slopes in absorption field areas or soil percolation rates of 60 minutes an inch or more, for one family structure:
a.
With public water supply system and on-site sewage management system or on-site wastewater treatment system: 65,340 square feet (one and a half acres) with a minimum 150 feet lot width;
b.
With individual water supply system and on-site sewage management system: 108,900 square feet (two and a half acres) with a minimum 150 feet lot width.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-324. - Required sizes for new lots in conservation subdivisions.
Lots in conservation subdivisions as defined by Pickens County land use ordinances may be smaller than specified under section 34-323 but not less than 21,780 square feet (one-half acre); a one-half acre lot must meet all the following criteria:
(1)
No soils exceed a percolation rate of 60 minutes an inch;
(2)
All soils are suitable for conventional absorption field systems;
(3)
Lots are only served by a public water supply system;
(4)
Proposed residential structures do not exceed a foundation footprint of 3,000 square feet, 5,000 heated square feet, and five bedrooms;
(5)
Lots contain basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, decks, porches and water supply line;
(6)
Slopes in absorption field areas do not exceed 25 percent;
(7)
There are no complex slope patterns dissected by rock, deep gullies and ravines.
If any of these criteria are exceeded, then the 21,780 (one-half acre) lot size requirement will be increased to 26,136 square feet (six tenths of an acre) or more depending upon number and magnitude of items exceeding these criteria.
Conservation subdivision lots served by individual water supply systems must be at least 43,560 square feet (one acre) and meet all above criteria (a) through (g); if any of these criteria are exceeded, size requirement will be increased to 54,450 square feet (one and one quarter acres) or more depending upon number and magnitude of items exceeding criteria.
Applications for on-site sewage system installations within conservation subdivisions will include a site plan at a scale of one inch:20 feet showing the residential structure, driveways, paved walkways, other buildings, easements, pools and all other appurtenances.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-325. - Required sizes for new commercial, multi-residential and other lots.
Proposed commercial and multi-residential property sizes will be determined by the maximum daily sewage flow for proposed structures on properties and lots with slopes of 25 percent or less and percolation rates of 60 minutes per inch or less.
Properties served by a public water supply system may apply 1,200 GPAD.
Properties served by an individual water supply system may apply 600 GPAD.
Commercial and multi-family residential properties with slopes greater than 25 percent and/or percolation rates greater than 60 minutes per inch shall be increased proportionally in size. Required minimum areas within properties for on-site management absorption fields will be based on 4,000 square feet useable soils per bedroom (2,000 square feet initial and 2,000 square feet replacement area) for apartments and other multi-family residential properties, and 4,000 square feet useable soils per 150 gallons of wastewater for commercial and similar properties.
Example: A proposed business will have a public water supply system and will generate 5,000 gallons of wastewater per day. With public water the maximum sewage flow is 1,200 gallons per day per acre. To determine the acreage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
5,000 gal/day divided by 1,200 gal/acre/day = 4.17 acres
NOTE: This does not mean that four and seventeen one-hundredths acres must be reserved for the septic system but that the entire property must be at least four and seventeen one-hundredths acres. However, enough suitable land area must be left within a property for the initial system and replacement system after buildings, paved areas, and appurtenances; minimum areas within properties for absorption fields equal 5,000 square feet useable soils per bedroom, and 5,000 square feet useable soils per 150 gallons wastewater per day for commercial and similar structures (2,500 square feet/bedroom for initial system plus 2,500 square feet for replacement system.) Reserved areas for initial and replacement systems may be reduced by an approved site plan for the initial and replacement systems, or by installing both the initial and replacement systems.
Example: A business will be served by an individual well (non-public system) and generates 5,000 gallons of wastewater per day. In this case the maximum sewage flow is only 600 gallons per acre per day.
5,000 gal/day divided by 600 gal/acre/day = 8.33 acres
Example: A residential property owner has a lot of eight tenths of an acre served by public water and wishes to build a six-bedroom home. Each bedroom requires 150 gallons per day x six bedrooms = 900 gallons per day. 900 gal/day divided by 1,200 gal/acre/day = seventy-five one hundredths of an acre. The property owner can build a six-bedroom home if soil areas are sufficient and suitable. If the property were served by an individual well or other non-public supply, the lot would have to be one and one half acres.
Where existing commercial and multi-residential properties are limited by land area, the property owners may propose on-site wastewater treatment systems and nitrogen reduction technologies for consideration by the county environmental health department.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-326. - Exemption for existing residential, commercial, multi-residential and other lots.
Undeveloped lots recorded before the date of adoption of this article are exempt from these lot size requirements but may not exceed 1,200 GPAD for lots served by a public water supply system and 600 GPAD for lots served by individual water supply system; property owners who wish to exceed these GPAD limits may propose on-site wastewater treatment systems and nitrogen reduction technologies for consideration by the county environmental health office.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-327. - Severability clause.
If any section, paragraph, clause, or provision of this article shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability of such section, paragraph, clause, or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this article, the intent being that the same are severable.

ARTICLE V. - DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH—MOBILE FACILITIES AND ON-SITE SEWAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Sec. 34-348. - Purpose.
The Pickens County Board of Health recognizes that wheeled mobile facilities are not suitable or safe for permanent residential occupancy and that by their construction are not intended for permanent occupancy. Further, mobile facilities have been found discharging sewage directly onto the ground surface and streams. Nothing in this article is intended to prevent a property owner from occasionally occupying a mobile facility on his or her own property provided the visit does not exceed two weeks, there is no prohibited discharge of sewage, and sewage contained in mobile facilities is properly disposed in a public or private sewage system.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(3), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-349. - Authority.
Under authority of O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5, specifying locations where onsite sewage management systems can be located and used, and specifying the types of residences, facilities and buildings that may be served by onsite sewage management systems, the Pickens County Board of Health adopts these provisions.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(3), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-350. - Definition.
Mobile facilities means a wheeled vehicle designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable and designed not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use by the transient public. This definition includes recreational vehicles, motor homes, truck campers, pop-up campers, dependent trailers, travel trailers and similar by whatever named called.
(Res. of 10-19-2017(3), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 34-351. - Provisions.
On-site sewage management systems may not be installed for or serve mobile facilities unless such mobile facilities are in properly zoned or approved locations such as recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds constructed on a common piece of property and intended only for use by their owners, tourists, travelers and guests. See exceptions in section 34-332 for single-family home construction, project construction and disaster relief occupation below.
This section shall not be interpreted to prevent property owners from storing recreational vehicles and similar mobile facilities they own on their residential properties and dumping accumulated wastewater from travel trips into their own septic systems; however, such mobile facilities shall not be used for permanent residential occupation nor permanently connected to a septic system.
