(9)
An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than 20 percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or any provision of this chapter will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of its license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, when the city council determines to its own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of any employee, the city council must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.
(10)
Whenever the licensee has defaulted in any obligation of any kind whatsoever, lawfully owing to the city, the city council, in its discretion, shall revoke the license of such licensee.
(11)
The council shall not revoke, suspend or refuse to renew any license provided for in this chapter without notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided for herein.

c.
In any event, no suspension shall be for a period of time longer than the time remaining under the license.
As to the penalties as set forth above, if there is a change in a majority of the licensed establishment's owners, partners or shareholders, the violations under the prior ownership shall not count against the new owners; however, a different corporation, partnership or other association will be charged with the violation of its predecessor(s) if a majority of the owners, partners or shareholders are the same.
