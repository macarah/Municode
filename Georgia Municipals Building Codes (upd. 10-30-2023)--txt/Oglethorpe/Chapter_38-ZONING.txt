These residential areas are intended to be defined and protected from the encroachment of uses which are not appropriate to residential environment. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air, and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of the different uses.

The principal use of land may range from single-family to multiple-family and garden apartment uses. Certain uses which are more compatible functionally with intensive residential uses than with commercial uses are permitted. The recreational, religious, and educational facilities normally required to provide an orderly and attractive residential area are permitted.
