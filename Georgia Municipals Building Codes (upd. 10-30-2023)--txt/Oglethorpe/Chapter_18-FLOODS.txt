ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 18-19. - Definitions.
Unless specifically defined in this section, terms or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations.
Flood orflooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1)
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
(2)
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as zone A.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one floor.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided such enclosure is not built as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements.
Mobile homes means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "mobile home" does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
Start of construction includes (for other than new construction of substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L 97-348)) substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start" means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as, clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as, garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, the term "actual start" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the term "actual start" means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, the actual start is the date on which the construction facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including at a minimum the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed.
Substantial improvement means, for a structure built prior to the enactment of this article, any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
(1)
Before the improvement or repair is started; or
(2)
If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
(Code 1986, ch. 9, art. II)
Sec. 18-20. - Penalties for violation.
Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor.
(Code 1986, § 9-11)
Sec. 18-21. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Code 1986, § 9-2)
Sec. 18-22. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwater;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Code 1986, § 9-3)
Sec. 18-23. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control problems;
(3)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future floodblight areas; and
(7)
To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Code 1986, § 9-4)
Sec. 18-24. - Lands to which this article applies.
This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city.
(Code 1986, § 9-5)
Sec. 18-25. - Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, or extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
(Code 1986, § 9-7)
Sec. 18-26. - Basis for establishing the areas of special hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in its Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) #130133, and any revisions thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part hereof.
(Code 1986, § 9-6)
Sec. 18-27. - Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Code 1986, § 9-8)
Sec. 18-28. - Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be:
(1)
Considered as minimum requirements;
(2)
Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and
(3)
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(Code 1986, § 9-9)
Sec. 18-29. - Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
