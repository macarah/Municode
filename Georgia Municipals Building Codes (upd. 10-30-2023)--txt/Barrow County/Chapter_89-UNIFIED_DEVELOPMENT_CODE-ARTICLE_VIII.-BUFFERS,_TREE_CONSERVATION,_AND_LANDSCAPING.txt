DIVISION 2. - ZONING BUFFERS BETWEEN INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES

Sec. 89-861. - Zoning buffers; where required.
A zoning buffer shall be required between any multi-family or nonresidential development project along a side or rear lot line that abuts a less intense land use, as follows:
Table 8.1: Zoning buffer requirements.
EXPAND
Adjacent uses or zoning districts: A zoning buffer is required along a side or rear lot line of the uses below when adjacent to one of the uses or zoning districts in the left column.
Townhouse or Multi-Family Office, Commercial, or Light Industrial Heavy Industrial
Agricultural District 25 Feet 25 Feet 100 Feet
1- or 2-Family Residential 25 Feet 50 Feet 100 Feet
Townhouse or Multi-Family 50 Feet 100 Feet
Office, Commercial, or Light Industrial 25 Feet
  (a)
A zoning buffer must be provided between any multi-family use (townhouses, apartments or mobile home park) and any agricultural zoning district or single-family or two-family use or zoning district;
(b)
A zoning buffer must be provided between any office or commercial use and any agricultural zoning district or any single-family, two-family or multi-family use or zoning district; and
(c)
A zoning buffer must be provided between any industrial use and any agricultural zoning district; any single-family, two-family, multi-family use or zoning district; or any office or commercial use or zoning district.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-862. - Zoning buffers; when required.
Zoning buffers are required to be created at the time of construction of any new development.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-863. - Zoning buffer design standards.
(a)
General. Zoning buffer areas shall contain no driveways, parking areas, patios, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall, utility or earthen berm constructed to provide the visual screening required to meet the standards of this Development Code. Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a zoning buffer if the screening standards of this Development Code will be subsequently achieved. Vehicular access through a zoning buffer may be allowed only as a condition of rezoning, special use or any type of master planned development approval by the board of commissioners, as follows:
(1)
Approximately perpendicular to the greater distance of the zoning buffer area and for drainage improvements required by the county based upon competent engineering studies which show these improvements to be necessary, upon approval of the planning and community development director planning and community development director or the board of commissioner's.
(2)
Except as provided above, the natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin this natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion upon approval of the planning and community development director; this easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required zoning buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvements.
(b)
Width of zoning buffer.
(1)
Zoning buffers required along any lot line shall be no less than the minimum required width as shown in Table 8.1.
(2)
When a proposed development adjoins an existing development but the full width of the required zoning buffer does not exist, the new development shall provide a zoning buffer of adequate width to meet the full width required in Table 8.1 when considered in combination with any existing zoning buffer on the property of the adjoining development.
(c)
Minimum required screening. Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural zoning buffer utilizing existing vegetation or a structural zoning buffer, whichever provides an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet, or any combination of existing and replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen six feet high within two growing seasons.
(d)
Natural zoning buffers. Natural zoning buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation but shall contain evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year.
(e)
Structural zoning buffers. Structural zoning buffers shall meet the following criteria:
(1)
Structural zoning buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area required for the zoning buffer around any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms, which may include grass, ground covers, shrubs, and trees.
(2)
All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of 50 percent (one foot of vertical rise to two feet of horizontal run). Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property.
(3)
Trees shall be located or planted within any structural zoning buffer at a density of no less than one overstory tree for each 40 feet of zoning buffer length or portion thereof or one understory tree for each 20 feet. Overstory and understory trees may be combined using the appropriate density distance for each. New deciduous trees shall have a caliper of no less than two inches upon planting, and new evergreens shall be at least five feet tall when planted. Trees may be clustered for decorative effect following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location, and design.
(4)
Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property and shall meet location requirements for fences and walls in section 89-407.
(5)
Fences used in zoning buffers must be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with waterproofing material.
(6)
The accompanying Figure 21 provides examples of natural and structural zoning buffers. Other solutions meeting the minimum requirements of this section are also acceptable.
Figure 8.1. Examples of zoning buffers
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-864. - Maintenance of zoning buffers.
Every zoning buffer required by this article shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the zoning buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-865. - Zoning buffer modifications.
(a)
Automatic reduction in zoning buffer width. If a structural zoning buffer is provided that creates an opaque screen to a height of no less than eight feet instead of six, the zoning buffer may be reduced to a width of no less than 75 percent of the zoning buffer width otherwise required. If the structural zoning buffer achieves a height of 12 feet or more, the zoning buffer width may be reduced to 50 percent of the width otherwise required.
(b)
Location of zoning buffers. Zoning buffers may be relocated on the site to best achieve the screening required.
(c)
Waiver for unnecessary zoning buffers. The board of commissioners may waive a zoning buffer requirement or reduce its extent to a temporarily appropriate level of screening if the comprehensive plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category such that a zoning buffer would not be required by this Development Code once the adjoining property is rezoned or developed.

(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-901. - Alternative compliance.
(a)
Overview. The intent of the tree conservation provisions of this Development Code is to ensure that an adequate amount of trees are preserved or planted on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required number of trees. To provide a viable alternative for such cases, the developer may be allowed to plant trees at his own expense on an alternate property in lieu of over-planting the development site.
(b)
Alternate tree plantings.
(1)
The county must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall 100 percent of the required tree units be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the development site.
(2)
Public properties, such as school sites, parks, fire stations and other publicly owned sites, will be given priority for alternate tree plantings.
(3)
Tree planting on alternate compliance properties shall be done simultaneously with the planting of trees on the development site such that inspections and final approval for the project will include trees planted on the alternate property.
(4)
The land disturbance permit for the development site will only be issued after the county has approved the alternate compliance request and the property designated to receive the alternate plantings.
