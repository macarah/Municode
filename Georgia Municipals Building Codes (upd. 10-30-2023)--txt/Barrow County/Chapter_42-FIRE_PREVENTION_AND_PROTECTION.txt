Purpose; governing body. The county fire district is created for the purpose of affording fire protection within the territory comprising the district, and the board of commissioners shall carry out the governing of the special district.
(c)
Levy of tax. The county fire district having been created for the purpose of affording additional fire protection for the territory comprising this district, the board of commissioners shall levy a tax to carry out fire protection within this area.
