The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the county in the same manner as the river corridor. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of this article, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the local comprehensive plan as established by the state department of community affairs. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs.

For new construction: The date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a building, including a manufactured home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; the excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt.)
(2)

Stream: A natural, free-flowing watercourse with either constant or intermittent flow of moderate volume typically less than that of a river.
Stream bank: The point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flows or wave action. For non-trout waters, the normal stream flow is any stream flow that consists solely of base flow or consists of both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. Base flow results from groundwater that enters the stream channel through the soil. This includes spring flows into streams. Direct runoff is the water entering stream channels promptly after rainfalls or snow melts.
Stream buffer:
(a)
The area of land immediately adjacent to the banks of state waters in its natural state of vegetation, which facilitates the protection of water quality and aquatic habitat.
(b)

Structural erosion and sedimentation control measures: Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sedimentation control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures, sediment traps and land grading. Such measures can be found in the publication "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia."
Structure height: For all structures other than buildings, the vertical distance to the highest point of a structure, as measured from the average grade at the base of the structure or directly below a projecting structure. See also "building height."
Subdivision:

Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before damage occurred.
Substantial improvement: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building prior to improvement.
The market value of the building should be:

For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified through enforcement of this Development Code and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Temporary event: An event or activity open to the public having a specific duration or the end of which is related to a specific action, usually lasting at most for only a few days at a time, which occurs upon private property in a manner of use that will significantly affect the ordinary use of the property in such a way as to constitute a public nuisance. The term "temporary event" may includes but is not limited to such activities as:
(1)
