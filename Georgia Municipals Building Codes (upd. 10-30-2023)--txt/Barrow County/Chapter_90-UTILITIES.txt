(b)
Prohibitions on storm drainage and groundwater. Stormwater, groundwater, rain water, street drainage, roof top drainage, basement drainage, subsurface drainage or yard drainage shall not be discharged through direct or indirect connections to a sanitary sewer. Under no conditions will sanitary sewage be discharged to a storm sewer.
(c)
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR, chapter I, subchapter N, (parts 405—471) are hereby incorporated. Certain industrial users are now or hereafter shall become subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards promulgated by the EPA specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties, which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard shall also comply with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in this section. The provisions of this article shall not be deemed as alleviating, compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Specific user charge and industrial cost recovery requirements, promulgated pursuant to the Act, shall be considered as a part of this article upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will be required to comply with pretreatment standards as outlined in 40 CFR, part 403. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in the wastewater, the chairman may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.6(c). When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the chairman shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR section 403.6(c). A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.13 and may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.15.
(d)
State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article.
(e)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation developed by the county and EPD. The chairman may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. Where necessary in the opinion of the county, equalizing may be required to bring constituents or volume to an acceptable level and to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow conditions may interfere with the POTW. Said equalization or holding unit shall have a capacity suitable to serve its intended purpose, as stated above, and be equipped with acceptable outlet control facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing conditions in the waste flow.
(f)
Accidental or slug discharges.
(1)
General. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include:
a.
Location of discharge;
b.
Type of waste discharged;
c.
Concentration and volume; and
d.
Corrective actions taken by the user.
(2)
Written notice. Within five calendar days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the county a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this section or other applicable law. Noncompliance with this provision shall constitute a violation of section 90-114 and subject the permittee to the penalties described in that section.
(3)
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call the county sewer emergency phone number in the event of a discharge of any of the substances enumerated in subsection 90-113(a) of this article.
(4)
Accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years, the chairman shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The chairman may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the chairman may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
a.
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
b.
Description of stored chemicals;
c.
Procedures for immediately notifying the chairman of any accidental or slug discharge; and
d.
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.
(5)
Hazardous wastes. It is a violation of this article to discharge or cause to discharge any material identified as a hazardous waste by the May 19, 1980 Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Regulations, part 261 or any revision thereof. This prohibition extends to all wastes identified in subpart D regardless of the quantity of hazardous material stored or generated.
(6)
Discharge to natural outlets, property, or storm drains. The discharge of any wastewater, sewage or polluted waters to any natural outlet or onto any public or private property shall be unlawful. The introduction of sanitary wastewater into a storm sewer system is prohibited.

The chairman is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
(19)
Show cause hearing.
a.
The chairman may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge or other violations to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any authorized representative of an industrial user.
b.
At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically.

(21)
Administrative penalties.
a.
Any user in noncompliance with provisions of this article, or orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. Such assessments may be added to the user's sewer service charges and the POTW shall have such remedies for the collection of such assessments as it has for collection of other service charges.
b.
The county reserves the right to pass on the amount of any fine imposed on the county by federal or state agencies to the user, when an identified user's violation of this article causes a fine to be levied. This right also applies to any monetary settlements made by the county to satisfy federal or state agencies. The amount, which can be passed on to a user, found responsible would be in addition to the amount of other administrative penalties sought by the county.
c.
Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The chairman shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the county, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(c)
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to upset.
(1)
Definition. For the purposes of this subsection, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c)(3)c., below, are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures, and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the chairman within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset:
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(d)
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to prohibited discharge standard violation.
(1)
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 90-113(a)(1)—(15) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
a.
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
b.
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(e)
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to bypass.
(1)
Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
a.
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (e)(3) and (4), herein below.
(3)
Advanced notice of bypass.
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need to bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the chairman, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the chairman of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The chairman may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
Bypass is prohibited.
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the chairman may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless;
1.
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.

(k)
Baseline report contents.
(1)
Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
(2)
Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;
(3)
Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
(4)
Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
a.
Regulated process streams; and
b.
Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR, part 403.6(e).
The chairman may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
(5)
Measurement of pollutants.
a.
The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process;
b.
In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or chairman) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations;
c.
A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The board of commissioners may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
d.
The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
e.
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR, parts 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the chairman;
f.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the chairman determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the chairman;
g.
The chairman may allow the submission of a baseline report, which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
h.
The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW;
(6)
Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 90-111) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and
(7)
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
a.
Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR, part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR, part 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR, part 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by subsection (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
b.
If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR, part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR, part 403.6 (e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR, part 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection 90-115(b) of this article, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the chairman within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
(l)
Analytical and sampling requirements for demonstrating continued compliance. All analyses conducted for compliance purposes shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions section 304(h) of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1314(h)) and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedure approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the environmental protection agency. Except as indicated below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the chairman may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(m)
Signatory and certification requirements. All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.

(Ord. of 3-27-2001, § 8)
Sec. 90-119. - Determination of wastewater volume.
Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the POTW will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from and metered by the customer's water provider. If the volume of water delivered to the POTW is greater or less than the volume purchased from the provider, the user shall make known to the county such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install county-approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the POTW. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the county, separate water meters installed in the county right of way are preferred for measuring non-sewered consumptive water usage. The county may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water system in order to determine the waste delivered by the industry. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the county will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the county. Other methods may be established by the county to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer, which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users which claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing county-approved meters to estimate flows to the POTW more accurately.

Sec. 90-125. - Sewer capacity allocation.
modified
(a)
Authorization to monitor and allocate capacity. The Barrow County Wastewater Department ("department") is authorized and directed to administer a system for tracking available capacity in each Barrow County sewer facility, determining whether sewer treatment facilities can serve proposed development, communicating the results of each determination to the person initiating a reservation request and, where available capacity exists, reserving capacity in sewer facilities.
(b)
Definition of available capacity. For purposes of this section, "available capacity" means the permitted capacity of a sewer treatment facility (the maximum daily flow approved by applicable regulatory bodies) less the sum of: (a) the quantity of average daily sewer flow produced by current users of the facility and (b) the quantity of expected daily sewer flow that has been reserved for future use.
(c)
Restrictions on reservation.
(1)
The department may not offer or sell to the public a reservation of capacity in a facility that lacks available capacity, except where the department has determined that additional capacity will become available before the proposed development will require it.
(2)
Sewer capacity may be reserved and provided for the proposed development of a property only at a rate that is consistent with the land uses and densities specified for the property by the future land use map as set forth in the county's comprehensive plan. provided that the requirements of this subsection (c)(2) shall apply only to properties rezoned after October 13, 2020. Applications to amend the future land use map may be submitted to the planning and community development department in accordance with the procedures set forth in the unified development code.
(d)
Reservation for county purposes. The department may set aside capacity for any reasonable purpose, including:
(1)
To create a capacity buffer for times of unusually high flow;
(2)
To ensure capacity is allocated in a balance between residential, commercial and industrial development at the county's sewer treatment facility(ies).
(e)
Proof of capacity required for development. Before applying for a development permit, developers must reserve sufficient capacity to serve the entire proposed development. Developers shall provide proof of such reservation as part of any application for a development permit.
(f)
Process for reserving capacity.
(1)
Any person desiring to reserve sewer treatment capacity for property within an area receiving sewer services provided by Barrow County must submit a reservation application to the department on the forms prescribed by the department. The process for reserving capacity is the same for all property uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial).
(2)
Applications shall be processed in the order received. Upon receipt of a completed application, the department shall determine whether there is sufficient available capacity in the applicable sewer treatment facility to meet the service requirements of the proposed development, and if not, whether available capacity will exist before the proposed development will require such capacity.
(3)
If capacity is or will be available, an applicant may reserve sewer capacity by application and payment of the sewer capacity charge that is determined by the department and approved by the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. The sewer capacity charge will be the entire sewer reservation fee charged by the department for reserving capacity.
(4)
When reserving sewer capacity, the applicant will be required to enter into a reservation agreement with Barrow County that will specify the county's requirements for sewer service, infrastructure, connection lines, easements, and the like. The reservation agreement will be in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A."
(5)
The Barrow County Board of Commissioners authorizes the county manager to execute on behalf of Barrow County any number of reservation agreements consistent with the reservation agreement attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and consistent with the terms and conditions of this section.
(6)
All fees shall be paid to the Barrow County Wastewater Department to facilitate the monitoring of allocated capacity.
(g)
Transfer of reserved capacity. Capacity shall be reserved for a specific development site. No portion of any reserved capacity may be sold, transferred, or assigned to any other person or entity without the written consent of the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. Furthermore, no portion of any reserved capacity may be used for any property other than the specified development site without the written consent of the Barrow County Board of Commissioners.
(h)
County's right to repurchase unused capacity. If the owner has failed to begin use of its reserved capacity within two years (as evidenced by failure to tap on to the county sewer system), the county may in its sole discretion elect to repurchase the entire reserved capacity by providing notice to the owner and returning the purchase price. If the owner has failed to fully use its reserved capacity within four years of purchase (as evidenced by fewer than the expected number of tap-ons to the county sewer system), the county may in its sole discretion elect to repurchase any unused capacity by providing notice to the owner and returning a pro-rated share of the purchase price.
(i)
Forfeiture of reserved capacity. The reservation agreement may provide for forfeiture of reserved capacity in the event of the owner's non-responsiveness and failure to use the reserved capacity, or the owner's failure to respond to a repurchase notification, provided that due notice and opportunity to respond shall be given the owner before the forfeiture occurs.
All policies, practices, resolutions, rules, and regulations in conflict with this section are hereby repealed. Any and all written contracts concerning the provision of sewerage capacity in effect prior to the adoption of this section shall remain in full force and effect, and shall not be amended or altered by virtue of the adoption of this section.

(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-501. - Findings.
(a)
Because Barrow County operates under the requirements of the NPDES Phase II Permit as well as federal and state statutory and regulatory mandates, including, but not limited to, the federal Clean Water Act, responsibility falls on the board of commissioners to provide function, personnel and means to comply with said requirements and mandates.
(b)
It is appropriate, in order to facilitate the county's compliance with applicable federal and state stormwater laws and regulations, to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity, in the form of a utility to be named the Barrow County Stormwater Utility ("stormwater utility"), dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of the county stormwater management system in conjunction with other water resource management programs.
(c)
The stormwater management systems located in the stormwater service area include hard structures and soft structures providing conveyance and detention of stormwater in prevention of flooding and assurance of water quality.
(d)
The future usefulness of existing stormwater management systems managed and/or owned by Barrow County rests on the ability to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance such systems and facilities in the stormwater service area in concert with management of other water resources. In order to do so, the county must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater utility operating and capital investment needs.
(e)
The stormwater utility's management and regulation of stormwater management systems will assist the county in protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the environment and will result in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the county in a variety of ways.
(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-502. - Establishment of a stormwater utility and stormwater enterprise fund.
(a)
There is hereby established a stormwater utility within and under the supervision of the county's department of stormwater management, which stormwater utility shall be responsible for providing stormwater management services, for inspecting and regulating stormwater management systems and related facilities, maintaining, repairing and constructing the county-owned stormwater management system, and for determining labor, material and administrative fees for these services.
(b)
The County Stormwater Enterprise Fund ("Stormwater Enterprise Fund") is hereby designated as a funding mechanism for the stormwater utility and shall operate as a funding mechanism for the stormwater services, inspection and regulation of the county stormwater management system, and maintenance, repair and construction of county-owned stormwater management system.

The Barrow County Finance Department shall maintain the Stormwater Enterprise Fund in the county budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, fees and licenses as may be established from time to time by the board of commissioners. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, to be held and invested in trust and expended exclusively for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to capital project construction. No other funds of the county shall be deposited in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater utility funds, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, including grants, loans, and bond proceeds, may be combined with and applied to stormwater utility capital projects as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation of the stormwater manager.
(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-503. - Scope of responsibility for the county stormwater management system.
(a)
The county stormwater management system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, and other structures, natural or manmade, that control or convey stormwater within the stormwater service area.
(b)
The county-owned stormwater management system consists of those segments of the county stormwater management system that are located within county property (including streets and rights-of-way), or in dedicated county-accepted drainage easements and stormwater facilities.
(c)
Except as provided in subsection 90-503(d), the stormwater utility shall have responsibility for providing stormwater services, inspecting and regulating the county stormwater management system, and constructing and maintaining the county-owned stormwater management system and other related assets, including related easements, rights-of-entry and access rights.
(1)
With respect to the county-owned stormwater management system, the stormwater utility will have responsibility to perform new construction, inventory, routine inspections, routine maintenance, emergency maintenance, corrective maintenance and retrofitting improvements.
(2)
With respect to elements of the county stormwater management system outside the county-owned stormwater management system, the stormwater utility may, as a stormwater service, where adequate legal access is available, perform inventory, routine inspections, routine maintenance, emergency maintenance, corrective maintenance and retrofitting improvements. The department of stormwater management may adopt policies governing the provision of these services.
(d)
The division of responsibility for maintenance of the county-owned stormwater management system in the county road right-of-way (and in drainage easements associated with the right-of-way) is as follows in the table below.
EXPAND
System Stormwater Utility Responsibility Roads and Bridges Department Responsibility
Culverts under Roadway (Non- Subdivision) None Full Responsibility

Sec. 90-504. - Requirements for commercial on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections.
All owners and developers of developed commercial land within the stormwater service area shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all federal, state, and county regulations. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the county in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found to exist by the court, which nuisance the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the county may enter upon the property and cause such remedial work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner. From the date of the filing of such action, the county shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of the county. The county shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

Sec. 90-505. - Determination and modification of stormwater service fees.
Stormwater service fees shall be based upon impervious surface area and shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the board of commissioners. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the objective of the board of commissioners to establish rates and fees that are fair and reasonable, which may include flat fee rates for certain classifications of properties, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties that benefit therefrom and which, together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of the stormwater utility's budgeted programs, services and facilities including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the county-owned stormwater management systems. Future capital investments and necessary reserve accounts, including but not limited to an emergency reserve account, may be included in the calculation of the stormwater service fees.
(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-506. - Effective date of stormwater service fees.
An annual service charge is imposed upon each parcel of developed land in the stormwater service area as of July 1 each fiscal year, beginning October 1, 2008, to fund stormwater utility programs. This annual service charge shall be known as the "stormwater service fee." Stormwater service fees shall be maintained in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund under the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. Purchases by the stormwater utility shall be made through the department of stormwater management for the sole purpose of performing the obligations of the stormwater utility under this ordinance and under applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to the county's NPDES Phase II Permit and the conditions outlined therein.
Stormwater service fees supporting stormwater utility needs will be determined for each fiscal year and will be approved by resolution during the budgeting process by the Barrow County Board of Commissioners.
(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-507. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, collections.
(a)
A stormwater service fee bill shall be attached to and/or included in the annual tax bill generated by the Barrow County Tax Commissioner and issued through the U.S. Postal Service. The stormwater service fees are due as stated on said bill as well as past due late charges. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay the stormwater service fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the county may back-bill for a period of up to four years, but shall not assess penalties, other than the late charge described in subsection (b), for any delinquency. The inclusion of the stormwater services fee with the annual tax bill is intended for convenience only, such stormwater services fees being fees for utility services provided to customers by the stormwater utility and not a tax or regulatory fee.
(b)
A one percent late charge per month shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent.
(c)
Suits for collection of unpaid stormwater service fees shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained.
(Ord. of 7-14-2020, § 2(Exh. B))
Sec. 90-508. - Requests for modification of the stormwater service fee.
Any property owner may request a review of their stormwater service fee by submitting a request in writing, along with any supporting information, to the stormwater manager within 30 days after the date the tax bill is mailed or issued to the property owner. Grounds for modification of the stormwater service fee include documentation and Barrow County personnel inspection verifying the impervious surface area on the parcel and other factors relevant to the fee calculation. A written response will be provided by the stormwater manager within 30 days of any request. All decisions of the stormwater manager may be appealed to the public works director. All decisions of the public works director shall be the final decision of the county. Any decision of the public works director may be reviewed upon application for writ of certiorari before the Superior Court of Barrow County, filed within 30 days of the date of mailing of the decision.
