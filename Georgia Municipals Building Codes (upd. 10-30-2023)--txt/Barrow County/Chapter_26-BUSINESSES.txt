Filing of application. Each applicant, whether a natural or corporate person, seeking a franchise to operate a cable television system in the unincorporated areas of the county shall file a written application with the board of commissioners at its offices in the county courthouse in Winder.

Compliance with state and federal regulations.

All applicants shall have a continuing obligation to comply with such rules and regulations.
(d)
Hearing. Upon receipt of the application, the board of commissioners shall cause to be mailed to the applicant and to each other applicant for a franchise to operate a cable television system and to cable television franchisees a notice of the time when and place where the board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing to discuss and act upon the pending application. All applicants and franchisees shall be permitted to address the board of commissioners at the meeting.

Required information; qualifications of applicant.

(f)
Fees and franchise taxes. The board of commissioners may enact such fees and charges, and impose such franchise taxes, as from time to time it deems advisable and as permitted by law.
(g)
Issuance.

(h)
Revocation and other sanctions. Should any franchisee breach its obligations as defined in its franchise so that the board of commissioners has probable cause to revoke its franchise or otherwise apply sanctions against the franchisee, the board of commissioners shall mail notice of the time and place for hearing this matter to the franchisee alleged to have breached its legal obligations. The franchisee shall have the opportunity to be heard at the time and place appointed and to be represented by counsel. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to deprive either the board of commissioners or any franchisee of pursuing other legal or administrative remedies available to it.
(i)
Notices. All notices shall be mailed not later than the eighth day before the time set for hearings. Applicants may waive this notice provision.
(j)
Interpretation of section. The purpose of this section is to establish a means of processing applications for franchises, and this section is not intended to create any substantive right in prospective applicants. The board of commissioners, in granting franchises, may frame the terms and conditions of such franchises as in its sole discretion it deems best suited to promote the public interest.
