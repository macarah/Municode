ARTICLE VI. - RIGHTS-OF-WAY[4]

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 98-9, §§ I—V, adopted November 3, 1998, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as §§ 62-136—62-141 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 62-136. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish policies and procedures concerning the use of the public rights-of-way of the city by private individuals, businesses, and property owners, to establish conditions for the issuance of permits for some encroachments, to prohibit encroachments without permits, to establish penalties, and to establish rules regarding awnings.
(Ord. No. 98-9, 11-3-1998)
Sec. 62-137. - Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meaning hereafter ascribed thereto:
Encroachment. The term "encroachment" shall include any purpresture or other trespass upon the public right-of-way either of a temporary or a permanent nature. The term would include but not be limited to any awning, sign, decoration, vegetation, object or machine attached to or extending from private property and extending upon, over or under the surface of any portion of the public right-of-way. The term shall include any landscaping, structure or device which has the effect of gathering rainwater or surface water and diverting it upon or under the public right-of-way in greater quantities than would be upon or under the public right-of-way if such artificial water diversion did not exist.
Right-of-way. The term "right-of-way" shall include the public streets, sidewalks, alleyways, approaches, curbs, and all other means of public access owned by the city or acquired by the public in general within the city, either by deed, lease, adverse possession, prescription, or contract.
Temporary encroachment. The term "temporary encroachment" shall apply only to objects, such as displays or machines, expressly excluding awnings and signs, which are placed upon the public right-of-way in conjunction with property, a business location, school, religious institution, or other lawful use of real estate adjacent to the public right-of-way. Such encroachments as described above which are placed upon the public right-of-way during normal business hours and removed from the right-of-way during all other times shall be defined as temporary encroachments.
(Ord. No. 98-9, § I, 11-3-1998)
Sec. 62-138. - Prohibitions.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon the public right-of-way by constructing or maintaining any structure, object or condition which is an encroachment upon, over or under any part of the public right-of-way. It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon the public right-of-way by constructing, landscaping or maintaining any condition upon adjoining property which has the effect of gathering surface or rainwater and diverting it upon or under any part of the public right-of-way, when the artificial means employed causes such water to divert upon or under the public right-of-way in greater quantities than would exist if the structure or landscaping did not exist. All encroachments are unlawful, except for those specifically allowed by this article or permitted by the city council by the issuance of a permit pursuant to this article.
(b)
Penalties. Unless allowed by this article or permitted by the city council pursuant to this article, any trespass or encroachment upon the public right-of-way as described above shall be punishable by citation and fine not to exceed $500.00, or incarceration up to six months or both.
(Ord. No. 98-9, § II, 11-3-1998)
Sec. 62-139. - Temporary encroachments.
(a)
Temporary encroachments. Temporary encroachments, as defined in this article, do not require a special permit, so long as they are maintained under the following rules:
(1)
A temporary encroachment over or upon any part of the public right-of-way may only be maintained for an encroachment which is reasonably convenient to the property, business location, school, religious institution, or other lawful use of real estate of the owner of the encroachment, which real estate is adjacent to the public right-of-way.
(2)
No temporary encroachment shall be allowed which will in any way damage or impede use of or access to the public right-of-way. An encroachment will be considered to damage the public right-of-way if placement of same results in any effect upon the appearance or usability of the public right-of-way after the removal of the encroachment. An encroachment will be considered to impede the public right-of-way if it in any way alters the flow of vehicular traffic upon the public roads or alleyways or if it in any way restricts ingress and egress upon the public sidewalk so as to reduce clearance upon the sidewalk to less than 48 inches in all directions, other than toward the property owner's exterior wall, except that, in the case of an encroachment over the public right-of-way, there shall be no less than seven feet six inches of clearance between the surface of the public right-of-way and the lowest point of such encroachment.
(3)
A temporary encroachment may only be maintained upon or over the public right-of-way during normal business hours in conjunction with the specific use of the adjacent property of the owner of the encroachment. The placement of any encroachment upon the public right-of-way during any time other than those specific times will be a violation of this article. All temporary encroachments must be completely removed from the public right-of-way at the close of business each day.
(4)
No temporary encroachment upon the public right-of-way shall be allowed which would in any way tend to violate any other ordinance of the city, state law or regulation, or federal law or regulation, including but not limited to the city zoning ordinance, city noise ordinance, the city nuisance ordinance, fire and safety ordinances, health codes, traffic laws, and laws requiring access for persons with disabilities.
(5)
All temporary encroachments shall be kept clean, orderly and in good working order.
(b)
Removal. Any city police officer or other city official with the power to enforce this article shall be empowered to remove from the public right-of-way any temporary encroachment found which in any way violates this article relating to temporary encroachments. Any failure to maintain the temporary encroachment in accordance with this article shall be a violation of this article and subject to the penalties referred to in section 62-138 of this article.
(Ord. No. 98-9, § III, 11-3-1998)
Sec. 62-140. - Long-term encroachments.
(a)
Long-term encroachment permits. It is the policy of the city council that there shall be no long-term encroachments upon the public right-of-way. Because no person, business or entity has ever acquired any right to place any encroachment upon the public right-of-way, no encroachment existing prior to the passage of this article shall have any special rights or privileges in this regard. Any person seeking to place any encroachment above, upon or under any part of the public right-of-way, which encroachment is not a temporary encroachment as defined in this article, shall be subject to the following rules:
(1)
Application for a permit shall be made directly to the city council. Long-term encroachment permits shall last from January 1 until December 31 of the year for which they are issued. There shall be no permit issued which shall last longer than December 31 of the year in which it is issued. The city council may issue a long-term encroachment permit for a shorter period of time.
(2)
A permit shall only allow an encroachment which will in no way damage or impede use of or access to the public right-of-way. An encroachment will be considered to damage the public right-of-way if placement of same results in any effect upon the appearance or usability of the public right-of-way after the removal of the encroachment. An encroachment will be considered to impede the public right-of-way if it in any way alters the flow of vehicular traffic upon the public roads or alleyways or if it in any way restricts ingress and egress upon the public sidewalk so as to reduce clearance upon the sidewalk to less than 48 inches in all directions, other than toward the property owner's exterior wall, except that in the case of an encroachment over the public right-of-way, there shall be no less than seven feet six inches of clearance between the surface of the public right-of-way and the lowest point of such encroachment.
(3)
The allowance of a permit for a long-term encroachment will not grant to the owner of the encroachment or the property upon which or from which the encroachment is permitted any prescriptive or other rights extending beyond December 31 of the year in which the permit is issued.
(4)
A person seeking a long-term encroachment permit shall apply in writing at the office of the city clerk and pay an application fee, to be established by the city council. The application fee shall include an administrative fee and the total costs of advertisement. The application shall include the inclusive dates and the location of the encroachment to be permitted and a specific description of the nature of the encroachment. The application shall include a drawing of the affected right-of-way showing the proposed location of the encroachment. The chief of police or other authorized agent of the city shall inspect the proposed location and the application and give a report to the city clerk. The city clerk will advertise the application and the time and date of the hearing before the city council for one week. The matter will be heard before the city council at the next regularly scheduled meeting held at least ten days after the appearance of the advertisement in the newspaper. At the hearing, the applicant will be allowed to speak first, the chief of police or other authorized agent who did the investigation will either speak or present a written report next, and then the city council will hear comments from the public as time permits. The city council shall either issue a permit or a written denial within three business days after the conclusion of the hearing, and the decision of the city council will be final.
(4)
An applicant must pay an administrative fee, which will include all of the costs of advertising, at the time of making the application. If the permit is issued, the permittee must pay an annual fee for the permit prior to its issuance. The amount of the annual permit fee shall be established from year to year by the city council, prior to the issuance of any permits for that year.
(5)
No long-term encroachment upon the public right-of-way shall be allowed which would in any way tend to violate any other ordinance of the city, state law or regulation, or federal law or regulation, including but not limited to the city zoning ordinance, city noise ordinance, the city nuisance ordinance, fire and safety ordinances, health codes, traffic laws, and laws requiring access for persons with disabilities.
(6)
All permitted encroachments shall be maintained in good working order with an orderly and clean appearance. Permitted encroachments must be maintained so as not to violate any of the restrictions specifically stated in the permit, the restrictions of this article, or the restrictions of any local, state or federal law as now existing or hereafter enacted. Failure to maintain a permitted encroachment in accordance with this provision and all other provisions of this article shall be a violation of this article, subject to citation and fine and incarceration, as established in this article. Any permitted encroachment shall be subject to inspection at any time by any officer empowered to enforce this article or directed by the city council to perform such inspections.
(b)
Revocation of permit. Any long-term encroachment permit may be revoked by majority vote of the city council, pursuant to notice and hearing as stated herein. If the city council wishes to consider revocation of such permit it shall first deliver to the business address associated with the encroachment a written notice of hearing stating the reason for the proposed revocation and setting a specific time and date for the hearing. Ten days' written notice to the permittee shall be granted, but notice shall be considered delivered when delivered to the business address associated with the permitted encroachment. At the hearing, the city council shall consider whatever testimony or evidence that it considers relevant and shall offer the permittee an opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the council shall decide whether or not to revoke the permit. If a permit is revoked, the encroachment will be removed immediately either by the owner or the city and a prorated portion of the annual fee shall be refunded to the permittee, after payment of all costs incurred by the city in removing and disposing of the encroachment, if the city actually removes and disposes of the encroachment.
(Ord. No. 98-9, § IV, 11-3-1998)
Sec. 62-141. - Awnings.
The following provisions apply to all awnings which extend over any portion of any public right-of-way. An awning which is attached to a building adjacent to the public sidewalk, which awning extends over any portion of the public sidewalk, may be allowed as a long-term encroachment by the city council, without advertisement and without the payment of an annual fee under the following conditions:
(1)
Style. Awnings shall be traditionally and historically accurate for the time period of the building. Awnings may be retractable or fixed type. Backlit awnings are not permitted.
(2)
Material. Awnings shall be made of canvas, vinyl coated, or acrylic material. Modern metal awnings are not permitted.
(3)
Location on building. Awnings shall be individually located within major window openings, door openings, or vestibules and they shall be designed to fit the shape and size of the specific window, door opening, or vestibule.
(4)
Specifications. The following specifications relate to awnings upon buildings located upon the square and within two city blocks of the square in all directions. Any awning placed upon any building in the vicinity of a planter or tree space belonging to the city must not be placed any closer than one foot from the nearest point of the outside edge of such planter or tree space. As long as an awning is no closer to a planter or tree space than stated previously, it may extend out from the building to which it is attached up to five feet. No portion of any awning, including supports, may extend closer than seven feet and six inches toward the surface of the public right-of-way. No supports, temporary or permanent, may be placed upon the public right-of-way. Street level awnings shall have dimensions no more than five feet in height (against the building) and five feet in length (extending out from the building), so long as there is no interference with other specifications for encroachments provided for in this article and other laws and ordinances. Awnings on openings higher than the street level shall be limited to three feet of height and three feet of extension from the building.

ARTICLE VII. - MOTOR VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMIT[5]

Footnotes:
--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 99-2, §§ I—IV, adopted May 4, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as §§ 62-151—62-154 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 62-151. - Weight limit of motor vehicles.
On city streets posted with weight limit warning signs, no motor vehicle may be operated with a total weight, including load and vehicle, in excess of 10,000 pounds.
(Ord. No. 99-2, § I, 5-4-1999)
Sec. 62-152. - Exceptions.
(a)
This weight limit shall not apply to school buses or vehicles owned by the city or specifically authorized by city council to operate upon the public streets in order to provide services to the public.
(b)
This prohibition does not apply to vehicles within the city limits while traveling exclusively upon state or federal highways or exclusively upon city streets with no signs notifying the public of the weight limits.
(c)
This prohibition does not apply to vehicles which are within the weight limits established by state law and traveling upon the city streets for the purpose of pickup or delivery to locations within the city which are not accessible by the exclusive use of federal or state highways or city streets without weight limits. This exception to the prohibition of overweight vehicles is expressly limited to use of public streets to travel by the most direct reasonable route from a federal or state highway or city street without weight limits to the place of pickup or delivery and back to the nearest federal or state highway or city street without weight limits. Such overweight vehicles shall not remain parked or standing upon a public street with a weight limit sign for any greater period of time than is reasonably necessary in order to accomplish the pick up or delivery, which is the reason for the exception to the prohibition.
(Ord. No. 99-2, § II, 5-4-1999)
Sec. 62-153. - Establishment of weight limited streets and posting of streets.
The city council shall from time to time establish which streets shall be designated as subject to the weight limitation by resolution. The designation will not be enforced until a street is posted. The city shall post signs notifying the driving public of this weight limit upon any city street designated by resolution. The signs shall be located upon such public streets at a point near their intersection with federal and state highways and other roadways upon which a weight limit exists which is greater than the weight limit established in this article.
(Ord. No. 99-2, § III, 5-4-1999)
Sec. 62-154. - Penalties.
Any violation of any portion of this article shall be punished by the issuance of a citation to be tried before the municipal court. The penalties shall be as stated in section 1-11 of this Code. Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the power and authority of the city to seek to recover damages against any party legally liable for damage caused to any city street or other property of the city by any vehicle due to the weight of the vehicle or its load.
(Ord. No. 99-2, § IV, 5-4-1999)

ARTICLE VIII. - PARKING OF COMMERCIAL TRUCKS AND TRAILERS IN RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTS[6]
Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— At the discretion of the editor, §§ 1—5 of an ordinance adopted May 5, 2015 , have been docified as herein set out in Art. VIII. Said provisions did not expressly amend the Code.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 62-171. - Purpose.
The intent of this article is to regulate the use of commercial vehicles within residential zoning districts other than the AR zoning district. Residential areas typically have road ways designed for the local access of passenger type vehicles. Due to size and weight, commercial vehicles often cannot easily maneuver or park on residential streets without causing damage to the road surface and hampering sight distance. Commercial vehicles, as a result of their size or appearance, including attached advertising, tools or equipment, are not in character with residential districts.
( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 62-172. - Definitions.
For purposes of this article the following definitions shall apply:
Commercial motor vehicle: Any self-propelled or towed motor vehicle used for commercial activities or the transport of passengers or property which, according to its manufacturer's specifications, has a gross vehicle weight or gross combination weight rating (a power unit towing another vehicle or trailer) of 10,001 pounds or more.
Trailer: Shall mean any type of wheeled vehicle, regardless of the activity for which it is being used, which is designed to be pulled by a motor vehicle and is more than 20 feet in length (as measured from the tongue or hitch to the rear of the frame).
Residential area: As used within this article the term "residential area" shall include all of the following zoning districts within R-30, R-20, R-l5, RM, R-P, NHC and P-R as defined by the Jackson Zoning Ordinance.
( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 2 )
DIVISION 2. - REGULATIONS AND UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES

Sec. 62-173. - [Placement.]
Commercial vehicles and trailers as defined herein shall not be parked or stored on the front or side portions of any lot in a residential area as defined herein.
( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 3 )
Sec. 62-174. - [Exceptions.]
Commercial vehicles and trailers as defined herein shall not be parked on any street or road within a residential area, as defined herein, except under the following conditions:
(1)
Commercial vehicles temporarily parked or standing for a period of less than four hours while engaged in providing services for the resident or property owner.
(2)
Trailers of any size engaged in providing services for the resident or property owner, and parked for less than four hours.
(3)
School buses, which operate for the transportation of school children to and from school or school activities, are allowed as long as they are not parked on the street or right-of- way, or on an unpaved area in front of the residence.
(4)
Construction vehicles on residential property where development, construction and/or repairs are being performed on the specific lot.
(5)
It is unlawful to park any commercial vehicle or any trailer as defined herein on the right-of-way of any street, driveway, front yard or side yard within a residential area as defined herein, unless said commercial vehicle is making a delivery to residential property. This section shall not apply to vehicles, trailers, or equipment temporarily located within a construction area, provided such vehicles, trailers or equipment are used in connection with dwelling units or utilities under construction or repair within such construction area. Any parking allowed within the right-of-way pursuant to this subsection shall comply with all other rules, regulations and ordinances of the county.
(6)
This article, having city-wide application, shall be enforceable without the necessity of a "NO PARKING" or "NO TRUCK PARKING" sign being posted within the right-of-way at or near the site of the violation. The three-day warning provision in subsection 62-175(a) shall constitute proper notice of the terms of this article.
( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 4 )
Sec. 62-175. - Enforcement.
(a)
Prior to the issuance of any citation the code enforcement officer or law enforcement official shall give written notice of a violation with three business days allowed thereafter to correct the violation. For purposes of this section it shall be sufficient if the three-day notice is prominently attached to the vehicle or trailer in question. If the violation has not been corrected after said three-day period the code enforcement officer, or any law enforcement officer, shall be authorized to issue a citation to the owner or person responsible for the commercial vehicle or trailer alleged to be in violation of this article. The Municipal Court of Jackson Georgia shall be authorized to determine upon proper hearing if a violation has occurred. Upon conviction of a first offense the minimum fine shall be $150.00 plus court costs. Upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense within a one year period the minimum fine shall be $500.00 plus court costs.
(b)
In the event the owner or person responsible for the commercial vehicle or trailer alleged to be in violation of this article fails to appear in court upon the issuance of a citation, or at any time a clear and present danger to public safety exists, the code enforcement officer shall have the authority to impound any vehicle found parked in a residential area in violation of this section. The expense of such action shall be charged against the property owner and shall become a lien on the property.
(c)
At any trial upon a citation for a violation of this article the zoning classification for the location of the alleged offense may be established by evidence of a letter signed by the Zoning Administrator of Jackson attesting to the zoning district, and such evidence shall be admissible notwithstanding any hearsay objection.
(d)
At any trial upon a citation for a violation of this article the gross vehicle weight of a commercial motor vehicle may be established by documentary evidence printed from the manufacturer's official website, any website of an official government agency, or through an internet service providing a VIN look up service for the vehicle.
( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 5 )
