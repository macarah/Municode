ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 7-51. - Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts from stormwater discharges within the city. Proper management of surface water runoff will reduce channel erosion, stream sedimentation, local flash flooding, assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards, and maintain as practically as possible the pre-development surface water runoff characteristics of the area.
(Former § 7-003B(1.))
Sec. 7-52. - Policy.
It is hereby declared to be public policy to:
(1)
Recognize the necessity of joint action where feasible by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of their worsening or recurrence;
(2)
Work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above-stated objective by encouraging through this chapter and other public actions the development of fewer but larger major detention facilities and incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities;
(3)
Maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development, and where feasible, restore the flood plain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions;
(4)
Require the development industry to maintain the function of the storm drainage system during the development process and property owners thereafter;
(5)
Encourage the construction of joint detention ponds serving several residential properties. The city encourages the location of these detention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate where it is in the general public's best interest in the construction of major detention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems;
(6)
Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective detention of runoff.
(Former § 7-003B(2.))
Sec. 7-53. - Applicability.
(a)
All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater management plan and hydrology study to the department for review and approval, except as provided in section 7-54 of this article.
(b)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction that will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm. The requirement of this paragraph may be waived by the director if it can be shown by detailed engineering including descriptions, drawings, calculations and any other pertinent information necessary and acceptable to prove to the director that one of the following conditions exists:
(1)
Installation of stormwater management facilities would reduce downstream flood peaks by less than one percent; or
(2)
The applicant demonstrates how the downstream drainage system will have enough capacity to receive any increase in runoff for the design storms and protect downstream development without the addition or improvement of stormwater management facilities; or
(3)
The applicant demonstrates the proposed site design will meet the standards of this chapter without such facilities.
However, the provisions of this subsection (b) shall not be waived if the director determines that such waiver would increase known flooding problems, or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system.
(Former § 7-003B(3.))
Sec. 7-54. - Exemption from requirements.
(a)
The following development activities are exempt from the requirements of providing a combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff:
(1)
Agricultural and forestry land management activities.
(2)
Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family dwellings.
(3)
Construction of a detached single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger development.
(4)
Non-residential developments with less than 5,000 square feet of land disturbance activity.
(5)
Developments of property where the runoff resulting from the proposed development is discharged directly into a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified 100-year flood zone, provided that approved sediment basins are constructed at each significant discharge point to prevent the discharge of sediment from the site, and provided that sufficient energy dissipation devices or structures are installed to limit post development stormwater velocities to less than or equal to pre-development flow velocities at any point on the perimeter of the project.
(6)
Residential developments consisting of single-family dwellings, each on a lot of five acres or more.
(b)
When the developer requests and the department agrees that development and construction of nonresidential projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention of other drainage facilities more practical, the department may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. Where joint detention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of building within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention facility, and the owners of the joint detention facility have submitted a written agreement that is satisfactory to the department and assigns to one of the parties the responsibility of maintaining that facility.

However, proposals for alternative systems shall be presented to the director for tentative acceptability prior to formal submittal of a stormwater management plan.
(f)
Stormwater retention facilities are recommended in all residential and commercial developments where possible, to provide an effective stormwater management facility, improve water quality, enhance groundwater recharge, and to provide an aesthetically pleasing amenity area to complement the development.
(g)
Design criteria.
(1)
The peak release rate of stormwater from all developments where detention is required shall not exceed the corresponding peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state for all intensities up to and including the 50-year storm event. Routing conditions must also be presented to prove that the facility can safely accommodate and pass the 100-year storm event, without damage to any dam or related structure.
(2)
The same methodology must be used for calculating pre-development and post-development rates of runoff from a site.
(3)
Detention designs may be rejected by the director if they incorporate structures and facilities that will demand excessive maintenance or utilize numerous small structures, if other alternatives are physically possible.

(Former § 7-003B(6.))
Sec. 7-57. - Location criteria for detention facilities.
(a)
Detention facilities shall be considered to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices.
(b)
Detention facilities shall be designed and located to promote interception of runoff from the proposed land use. "By-pass" areas (areas of non-regulated runoff) shall be permitted only if the combined peak discharge rate from the site meets the requirements of sections 7-55 and 7-56 of this part.
(c)
Detention facilities shall be located in conformance with the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (see O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6, 16) and the flood damage prevention regulations of the city.
(d)
Detention facilities shall be located in accordance with the restrictions created by Title 44, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Parts 59 and 60 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended.
(e)
Detention facilities shall be located in conformance with the provisions of the Clean Water Act of 1974 as amended regulating land disturbing activities within designated wetland areas. (See Title 404 of the Federal Regulations.)
(f)
Detention facilities may be constructed within a transitional buffer or recreation areas, upon approval by the director of planning and development on an individual basis dependent on site-specific conditions. Title to the recreation area is to be held by a property owners association, homeowners association or private entity and the design will not interfere with the intended use of the area. Detention facilities constructed on individual lots will be owned and maintained by the property owner.
(g)
The 100-year ponding elevation created by the detention facility shall be considered a flood hazard and as such, shall require the same provisions as the base flood as defined by the flood damage prevention regulations of the city.
(h)
The drainage system from a proposed development must discharge into an outfall with adequate capacity to accommodate the runoff from the development. If downstream easements are needed to extend the drainage system to an adequate outfall, the developer shall seek these easements. In the event such easements cannot be obtained by the developer, the county may, at its option, agree to assist the developer in obtaining needed drainage easements using its powers, including condemnation.
(i)
Detention facilities may be incorporated into lake or pond designs. All such facilities shall be designed and constructed in conformity with applicable state and federal regulations. Design engineers are expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60, "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." In lieu of more restrictive design standards, the principles and practices for dam construction as detailed in Design of Small Dams, United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Third Edition, 1987, shall be used.
(j)
Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm. In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm. Detention in ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak flow occurs.
(k)
The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. Roadway embankments will not be allowed as a dam for a detention facility.
(l)
Detention facilities may not be located within utility easements, or encroach upon utility easements or right-of-way, unless the owner provides the department with written permission from both the property and utility owners.
(Former § 7-003B(7.))
Sec. 7-58. - Access and fencing requirements.
(a)
Access.
(1)
A 20-foot access easement shall be provided to all storm water management and detention facilities from a public right-of-way. Within the easement shall be constructed an access road of at least 12 feet in width. The road shall have a 12-inch base compacted to 95 percent of the Standard Proctor soil test and be grassed.

Piped systems and other drainage facilities, whether in an easement or not, outside the county right-of-way, are the responsibility of the mandatory homeowners association in residential subdivision developments or the property owner of commercial property. In residential or commercial developments, stormwater management facility maintenance is to be vested in the mandatory homeowners or property owners association with responsibility clearly vested in the organization through established covenants previously approved by the director. The city has the right, but not the responsibility to access any stormwater management facility for maintenance purposes.
(b)
Regional stormwater retention facilities, which are deemed by the city to be an essential and integral part of the city stormwater management plan, may be maintained by the city. In order to facilitate the maintenance of said stormwater retention facilities, a drainage easement shall be provided which will encompass the 100-year flood elevation contour plus 20 feet. The 20 feet shall be measured horizontally outward from the 100-year flood elevation contour. An improved access easement shall be provided from an existing or proposed right-of-way to the regional stormwater detention facility as required in section 7-58.
(c)
A stormwater retention facility built to satisfy the requirements of this Section shall be maintained to satisfy the requirements set forth herein. The shorelines must be graded so that there is not a sudden change in elevation. The banks of the impoundment beyond the normal pool contour shall be graded to a slope not steeper than a six horizontal to one vertical. A retention facility shall require periodic maintenance of the outlet structure and the dam.
(d)
All stormwater detention facilities shall be graded so as to provide positive drainage. The minimum slope along the bottom of the facility shall be two percent.
(e)
Inspection and maintenance agreement.
(1)
An inspection and maintenance agreement shall be executed for all private on-site stormwater management facilities prior to final plat approval. Such agreement shall be in form and content acceptable to the director, and shall provide that all maintenance and repairs of such facilities shall be the responsibility of the developer, property owner, or other entity approved by the city.
(2)
Such agreement shall provide for access to the facility by virtue of a non-exclusive perpetual easement dedicated to the city for periodic inspections of the facility by city personnel. The agreement shall provide that preventive maintenance inspections of infiltration systems, retention, or detention facilities may be made by the city, at its option. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the city's inspection schedule may include an inspection during the first year of operation and once every two years thereafter. Inspection reports shall be maintained by the department.
(3)
The agreement shall provide that if, after an inspection, the condition of a facility presents an immediate danger to the public health, safety or general welfare because of unsafe conditions or improper maintenance, the city shall have the right, but not the duty, to take such action as may be necessary to protect the public and make the facility safe. If it is determined that such deficient conditions are the result of neglected maintenance or other action caused by the owner, then any cost incurred by the city shall be paid by the owner as set forth in subsection (4) below.
(4)
The agreement shall provide that the city shall notify the owner(s) of the facility of any violation, deficiency or failure to comply with this division. The agreement shall also provide that upon a failure to correct violations requiring maintenance work, within 14 calendar days after notice thereof, the city may provide for all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) of the facility shall be assessed the costs of the work performed by the city pursuant to this subsection and there shall be a lien on all property of the owner in which said property utilizes or will utilize such facility in achieving stormwater management, which lien, when filed in Walton County real estate records, shall have the same status and priority as liens for ad valorem taxes. Should such a lien be filed, portions of the affected property may be released by the city following the payments by the owner of such portion of the property of such owner's pro-rata share of the lien amount based upon the acreage to be released with such release amount to be determined by the director.
(5)
The agreement shall be recorded by the owner in the land records of Walton County prior to the final plat approval or the issuance of any building permit for the subject property(s).
(Former § 7-003B(9.))
Sec. 7-60. - Maintenance of pre-existing stormwater facilities.
