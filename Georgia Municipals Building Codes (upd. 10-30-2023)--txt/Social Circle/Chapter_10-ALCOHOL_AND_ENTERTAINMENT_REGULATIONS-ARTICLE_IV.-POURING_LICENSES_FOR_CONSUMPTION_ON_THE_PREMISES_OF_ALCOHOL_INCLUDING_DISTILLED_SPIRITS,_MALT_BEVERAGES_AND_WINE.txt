(6)
The city, in its reasonable discretion, may objectively consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If in the reasonable judgment of the city circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.

It shall be unlawful for any licensee to knowingly allow any person to frequent the licensee's premises for the purpose of soliciting prostitution. Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and council note the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the mayor and council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly those where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served. The mayor and council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above-mentioned crime problems.
In addition to the prohibitions under state law at O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41, no alcoholic beverages may be sold in any restaurant which features performances by topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers or similar entertainers whose performances involve erotic dancing including without limitation the simulation of sexual activities and/or erotic or lewd touching. No such adult entertainment may be located within 1,000 feet of any restaurant selling alcoholic beverages.
