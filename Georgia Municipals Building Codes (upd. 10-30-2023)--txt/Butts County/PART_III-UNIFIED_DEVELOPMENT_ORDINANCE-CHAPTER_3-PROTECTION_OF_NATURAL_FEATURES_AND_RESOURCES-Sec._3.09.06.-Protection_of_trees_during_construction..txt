Sec. 3.09.06. - Protection of trees during construction.
Methods and standards for tree protection shall be required as follows:
(a)
Trees identified to be preserved and/or planted, and being counted as credit for meeting the requirements of section 3.09.00, shall have a valid, recognizable method of tree-protection (tree-save) marking or delineation installed at the critical root zones.
(b)
No person engaged in the construction of any structure(s) or improvement(s) shall encroach on a designated tree-save/critical root zone area with heavy machinery or the storage of heavy building materials.
(c)
During construction, a tree-save area must be designated around any trees that are to remain at the end of construction. Desirable trees should be identified and a physical barrier set up around the tree or group of trees. This barrier can consist of a four-foot high orange safety fence, wide plastic caution tape, a simple fence made of lumber, or other appropriate methods that can identify the noninvasive drip line area.
(d)
The barrier should be placed beyond the drip zone (critical root zone) and should prevent the stockpiling of soil or building materials, dumping cleaning solvents, or parking vehicles or equipment within this barricaded area.
