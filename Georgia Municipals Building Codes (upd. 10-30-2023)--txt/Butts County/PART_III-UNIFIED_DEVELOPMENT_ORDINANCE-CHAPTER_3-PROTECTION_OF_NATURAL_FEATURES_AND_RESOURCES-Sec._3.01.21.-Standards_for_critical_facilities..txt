Sec. 3.01.21. - Standards for critical facilities.
Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include:
(a)
Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials;
(b)
Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;
(c)
Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and
(d)
Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines.
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
