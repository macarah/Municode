(a)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
