Sec. 3.07.04. - Permit requirements and enforcement.
No building permit, rezoning request, or subdivision plan may be approved by Butts County or its designee unless the permit, request or plan is in compliance with the aquifer protection standards listed in section 3.07.05.
(a)
Enforcement. Butts County or its designee, its agent, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately-owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examination, surveys, or sampling as Butts County or its designee deems necessary.
(1)
The Butts County zoning and planning department and the Butts County building inspector are hereby designated respectively as the administrator and enforcement officer for this article.
(2)
The County building inspector shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits thereunder; and address violations or threatened violations thereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders, and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees, and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
(3)
Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the county building inspector in enforcement.
(4)
Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law. Each violation of this act shall be a separate offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
(5)
The county building inspector shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified in section 3.07.06.
(6)
When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to remove the structure or bring said structure into compliance with this article.
(7)
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable.
(b)
Permit review and site plan requirement. Applications for a development permit within the aquifer recharge area district shall include a site plan, with the exception of certain exempted activities identified in subsection (c) of this section. The following information is required for all site plans:
(1)
A map shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or other appropriate scale as determined by the county, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth, and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, water courses, and drainage ways; water, waste water, and storm water facilities; and utility installations.
(2)
Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site.
(3)
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
(4)
Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than five feet.
(5)
Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials.
(6)
Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross-section drawings showing existing and proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale, and vertical scale must be shown on cross-sectional drawings.
(7)
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan, that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill, or removal of vegetation during construction, or otherwise result in an alteration of the overall appearance of the development proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the county. Minor changes, such as realignment of other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions, are exempted from this requirement.
(c)
Exemptions to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans:
(1)
Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels.
(2)
Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development.
(3)
Construction of minor structures, such as sheds, or additions to single-family residences.
(d)
Review procedures. The application shall be made to the county zoning administrator and will be reviewed within 60 days or in accordance with established review procedures for the type of development being constructed, whichever is greater. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the county zoning administrator. The applicant may request written notification of the findings of the county zoning administrator. If the review process is not completed within 60 days or in accordance with established review procedures for the type of development being considered, whichever is greater, the application is considered to be approved for the purposes of this article. Decisions of the county zoning administrator may be appealed to the Butts County board of appeals.
(e)
Duration of permit validity.
(1)
If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire.
(2)
If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire 12 months after the date that work ceased.
(3)
Written notice of pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the zoning administrator or designee.
