Effect.
a.
For a property on which a use, building, structure or other improvements existed in conformity with this UDO prior to the effective date of a text amendment affecting the property, any such use, building, structure or other improvements no longer in conformance shall be governed under the provisions for nonconforming uses in article 2, use regulations and restrictions, of this UDO.
b.
Construction of any use, building, structure, or other improvements for which a building permit has been issued in conformity with this UDO prior to the effective date of a text amendment may continue to completion as though no change had occurred and, upon completion, shall be governed under the provisions for nonconforming uses in article 2, use regulations and restrictions, of this UDO, as applicable.
B.
Dimensional and locational variances.
1.
The city council and the community development director may authorize dimensional and locational variances from the terms of this UDO that are not contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions and not to the intentional conduct of the applicant, the literal enforcement of the provisions of this UDO would result in an unnecessary hardship. Neither the city council nor the community development director may authorize variances which are unrelated to dimension or location, The city council's variance authority shall not be limited as to the amount variance which may be granted, so long as all UDO standards and requirements for variances are met. The community development director's authority to grant variances shall be limited to the following:
a.
Front yard setback. Variance not to exceed 35 percent of the required setback;
b.
Side yard setback. Variance not to exceed five feet;
c.
Rear yard setback. Variance not to exceed five feet;
d.
Minimum square foot requirements. Variance not to exceed 35 percent of the required floor area;

h.
All other dimensional requirements of this section excluding the sign provisions. Variance not to exceed 35 percent of the required dimension.
2.
A variance from the terms of this UDO shall not be granted by the city council or the community development director unless and until a complete application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
3.
For variances to be considered by the city council, notice of a public hearing shall be given as required in section 12.05, public hearing.
4.
In granting a variance, the city council or the community development director or their designees may impose such conditions as may be necessary to comply with the factors herein to reduce or minimize potential injurious effects of such variance upon neighboring properties and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this UDO.
a.
In making such determination, the city council or the community development director shall consider all of the following factors whether:
1)
The subject property will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without a variance;
2)
The essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
3)
The variance would adversely affect the delivery of government services (i.e., water, sewer, garbage);
4)
The property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated through some method other than a variance;
5)
The spirit and intent behind the UDO requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance; and
6)
Any other relevant factor to assist the board of adjustments and appeals in weighing and balancing the public and private benefits and harms of the requested relief is necessary.
b.
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings on other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
c.
Financial hardship alone is not a valid reason for requesting and receiving approval of any variance.
5.
In granting any variance, the city council or the community development director may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the intent of this UDO.
6.
In granting any variance, the city council or the community development director shall authorize only the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate that will provide adequate relief.
7.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this UDO and punishable under the provisions of this UDO.
8.
Under no circumstances shall the city council or the community development director grant a variance to allow a use not permitted under the terms of this UDO in the district involved, or any use expressly, or by implication, prohibited by the terms of this UDO in the district where the variance is being considered.
C.
Appeal of administrative review.
1.

Stay of proceedings.
a.

b.
In such case, proceedings may be stayed by a restraining order issued by the city council or by a court of record, on application, on notice to the parties of interest and for good cause shown.
3.
