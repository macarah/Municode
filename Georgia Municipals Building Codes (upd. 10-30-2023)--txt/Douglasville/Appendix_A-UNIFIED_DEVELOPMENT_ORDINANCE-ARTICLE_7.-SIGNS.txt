ARTICLE 7. - SIGNS

Sec. 7.01. - Findings and purpose of sign regulations.
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to allow for the free expression of ideas and information, to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the city, to take advantage of the beauty of the city's natural environment, to ensure the orderly flow of traffic, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs that will:
A.
Promote and protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.

Sec. 7.07. - Measurement of sign area and height.
A.
Computation of sign area. To determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this article, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured.
1.
Sign face area.
a.
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
b.
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face.
c.
For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign.
d.
The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module.
e.
Changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. Both changeable and fixed elements of signs with changeable copy signs are counted toward a single sign face area.

Figure 7-2 Sign Area Measurement Wall Sign
Figure 7-3 Sign Area Measurement Wall Sign Cylindrical or Kiosk Sign
2.
Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure.
B.
Multi-faced signs.
1.
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides.
Figure 7-4 Sign Area Measurement Double-Faced Sign
2.
Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between all of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction.
C.
Measurement of sign height and distance.
1.
Sign height. The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street within 100 feet of any portion of the sign, to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berms and elevated foundations supporting signs, signposts or other sign supports shall be included in the height of the sign.
2.
Measurement of distance. Minimum distances required hereunder shall be measured along the shortest straight line from the nearest point on a sign structure to the nearest point on a property line, sign structure, building or structure to which the minimum distance requirement applies.
Sec. 7.08. - Regulation of specific types of permanent signs.
A.
Freestanding signs.
1.
Distance between. Each freestanding sign having an area of 75 square feet or less shall be located at least 50 feet from any other freestanding sign on the same side of the street. Each freestanding sign having an area of between 75 and 300 square feet shall be located at least 100 feet from any other freestanding sign on the same side of the street. The director may reduce the distance if it cannot be met due to the location of existing signs on separate but adjoining lots. Such reduction shall be the minimum required to maintain the greatest separation possible from such existing signs.
2.
Interior signs. Interior signs are allowed as accessory uses on a property occupied by a planned center or by any multi-family, commercial or institutional, or industrial use exceeding five acres if each sign complies with all of the following:

Guidelines for projecting signs in historic district.
1)
Introduction. This sign type is mounted perpendicular to a commercial building's façade, typically in the area above the storefront. These signs contribute to the streetscape by providing pedestrian-scaled advertising and wayfinding for commercial activities along the street. Projecting signs should be designed to be proportional to the scale and mass of the building, to be compatible to the character and materials of the building, and to be easily read from both sides. The location, size, and appearance of projecting signs should contribute to street activity and enhance the street-level experience. Projecting signs should have display surfaces that are made of wood, metal, or composite materials. Letters, logos, symbols, or designs should be engraved, painted, or surface mounted. Because of their pedestrian scale, it is not recommended to have internally illuminated projecting signs, although they may be externally illuminated with gooseneck or other suitable fixtures that are directed at sign. Projecting signs should not obscure or destroy the architectural details of historic buildings.
Figure 1
"Projecting sign" means a sign attached to a building or structure in such a manner that either:
a)
The sign is not parallel to that part of the building or structure to which it is attached. A sign is not considered to be projecting if it is placed vertically to a fascia or mansard that has an angle of not more than 30 degrees from the vertical, and if it is attached in a horizontal plane at either the top or bottom of the sign; or
b)
The sign extends horizontally, vertically or diagonally beyond that part of the building or structure to which it is attached. A sign placed parallel to a vertical fascia, wall or parapet and extending less than half of its height above the fascia, wall or parapet is not considered a projecting sign.
2)
Sign permit required. No person may place or maintain a sign or modify an existing sign (including changes to copy or colors) without a sign permit. This title and the sign permit requirements apply only to a sign or sign structure that is either located on or outside of a building, or intended to be seen from another public or private property.
General standards for approval. A sign permit may be granted by the reviewing body only when the proposed sign meets all of the following general standards:
i.
The materials, colors, design, height, size and scale of the sign are visually compatible with the structure, site, and use to which the sign corresponds, and the UDO's historic preservation standards in which the sign is located;
ii.
The placement and size of the sign will not threaten or impair the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorists;
iii.
The sign is of professional quality and is clear and legible;
iv.
The height and size of the letters and graphics on the sign enable pedestrians and motorists to readily identify the message, facility or site from a sufficient distance that will enable them to safely and conveniently read the message or access the facility or the site;
v.
The sign does not unreasonably impair the visibility of existing signs on adjacent property;
vi.
The sign complies with the purpose and standards of city's unified development ordinance historic district sign regulations.
3)
Sign permit procedures.
Application. The property owner, business owner, or designated applicant may file an application for a sign permit. The sign permit application shall be in a form and manner prescribed by the community development director. At the time of filing, a sign permit application shall be accompanied by the designated fee set forth by city council resolution, and by the following data and reports unless waived by the community development director:
i.
Site plan. A fully dimensioned site plan showing the specific location and size of the proposed sign(s);
ii.
Elevation(s). Fully dimensioned elevations showing the specific placement, size, and dimensions of the proposed sign(s) and the horizontal length (in feet) of the building frontage on which the proposed sign(s) would be placed;
iii.
Renderings or images of each sign requested; and
iv.
Colors and materials of the proposed sign(s) and all structural elements.
v.
Additional information may be required as determined by the community development director in order to provide a clear graphic description of the sign proposed, and in order to ensure that the sign can be adequately evaluated pursuant to this title.
Building permit. No building permit to install a sign that is subject to a sign permit under this title shall be issued prior to the approval of the sign permit.
Conditions. The reviewing body may impose conditions to ensure compliance with this title when granting approval of a sign permit application.
Decision. The reviewing body (community development department) may approve, approve with conditions or deny the application.
Other regulations. In case of a conflict between sign regulations, the stricter regulation applies. In addition to this title, signs in the city are governed by the general plan and by all applicable Federal, State, and city regulations.
Appeal. The decision of the reviewing body may be appealed to the next highest authority. A written request for appeal must be filed with the community development department within ten days after the date of the decision.
4)
Approval criteria for projecting signs. The community development director or designee may approve an application for a sign permit to place a projecting sign; provided, that the proposed projecting sign:
a)
Will be attached to a building frontage, or hung from the eaves or soffit along a building frontage occupied by the business or use identified by the sign;
b)
Will be placed only on the first story of a building when no sign program is established, or, when a sign program allows, may be placed above the ground floor to identify an occupant in a tenant space located above the ground floor;
c)
Will be attached to or hung from an eave or soffit only when the sign is a minimum of 15 linear feet away from an interior lot line;
d)
Will be placed below the roof line or parapet of the building;
e)
Will be placed so that the lowest portion of the sign is a minimum of eight feet above any pedestrian walkway and will not be placed above a vehicular passageway;
f)
Will be not more than four inches nor less than one inch thick, except as reasonably required in connection with some graphic element of the sign; and
g)
The minimum size of a projecting sign will be no smaller than ten percent of the wall facing a street;
h)
The maximum size of a projecting sign will be no more than 25 percent of the wall facing street;
i)
Will be not internally illuminated.
5)
Methods of calculating sign area, height, and number.
a)
Number of signs. There will be a limit of one frame per building frontage, however a frame may contain more than one projecting sign if the building is a multi-tenant unit.
b)
Sign Area. The size of a sign is measured by the square area of the sign face (to the perimeter of the sign) or, for random-element signs, the area of a circle or the smallest polygon containing six or fewer sides of the sign face. The supporting bracing, framework, or architectural embellishments of the sign that are clearly incidental to the display shall not be computed as sign area. Sign area shall be calculated as the area of the sign face. When calculating the size of a multi-sided sign, only one side of the sign face shall be included in the measurement of sign area.
c)
Sign area, maximum cumulative. Maximum cumulative sign area includes the total square footage of all signs pertaining to the use or business, except for signs specifically excused from the maximum cumulative sign area by this title.
d)
Sign height. The height of a building sign is measured as the vertical distance between the highest point on the sign and the grade immediately below the sign. The height of a projecting sign is measured as the vertical distance between the highest point on the sign and the grade adjacent to the sign footing.
e)
The sign is not placed higher than necessary to provide for the clear visibility of the sign and its message from a state highway, and is located within a reasonable proximity of the start of the off-ramp to which it applies;
f)
The size of the text and logo is large enough for drivers to safely identify the sign from a distance, yet not so large that it substantially exceeds a size necessary for the sign to be legible to vehicular traffic;
g)
Number. One projecting or suspended sign may be allowed per tenant space or building frontage. Projecting signs (Figure 1) or (Figure 2) are permitted in addition to allowable wall signage:
h)
Sign size. The face of a projecting or suspended sign shall not exceed 12 square feet in area.
Figure 2
6)
Location.
a)
No part of any projecting sign shall be located lower than eight feet above the grade of sidewalk, walkway or driveway that is directly below the sign or within three feet of the sign.
b)
Projecting signs may extend a maximum of four feet from the building and shall be spaced a minimum of six inches away from the building.
c)
No projecting sign shall be located within 25 feet of another projecting sign on the same site or on the same building.
d)
No projecting sign shall be located higher than the first story level of the building.
e)
No projecting or suspended sign shall extend into the right-of-way, including the sidewalk.
Figure 3
7)
Design.
a)
In the historic district, projecting sign may not be illuminated.
b)
Projecting signs shall be perpendicular to the building wall to which it is affixed. Suspended signs may be perpendicular or parallel to the building wall.
c)
Projecting signs shall not exceed four inches in thickness.
d)
Projecting signs shall be supported by or suspended from solid rods or otherwise tethered or reinforced to avoid movement in wind.
B.
Planned developments. For signs in a planned unit development (PUD) or master planned development, each property or individual development project within the planned development shall conform to the sign regulations established as part of the zoning approval for the planned development. If no such regulations exist, each property or individual development project within a planned development shall conform to the provisions of this article in accordance with the land use category of said property or individual development.

There shall be no variances from the sign regulations of this article.
Sec. 7.13. - Uniform sign plan.
A.
A uniform sign plan is required for any planned center, such as a shopping center with three or more establishments, before any signs for the planned center or the center's tenants may be erected on the property.
B.
The uniform sign plan shall govern the placement and design of all signs within the planned center as to their location, materials, size, letter style, and color.
C.
A uniform sign plan shall be submitted and approved as follows:
1.
The uniform sign plan shall consist of such drawings and specifications as may be required to clearly illustrate the location, materials, size, letter style, and color of each and every sign to be placed as freestanding and building signs within the development.
2.
The uniform sign plan is to be submitted to the director. The uniform sign plan shall be approved upon a finding by the director that:

The plan provides that signs of a similar type and function within the development shall have a consistency of size, lettering style, color scheme, and construction materials to present a unified design concept while respecting the differences between tenant types and occupancies.
b.
The signs proposed in the uniform sign plan shall comply with the requirements of this article, such as number, location, and size restrictions.
3.
All tenants of the planned center, whether an owner, lessee, subtenant, purchaser, or other occupant, shall comply with the approved uniform sign plan.
Sec. 7.14. - Nonconforming signs.
A.
In all use districts, signs which on the effective date of this article become nonconforming with respect to the requirements set forth in this article may continue in existence so long as the size is not increased beyond that existing as of the effective date of this article and no change is made in the technology of the sign other than as provided in subsection (F) of this section, provided that no portable sign shall be considered a nonconforming sign.
B.
Existing signs which were legally erected but which have become nonconforming and do not meet the setback requirements of this article due to a road widening project may be moved to meet the setback requirements of this article but shall not be increased in size, shape or changed in any manner except as to meet the requirements of this article, provided, however, this subsection shall not allow the relocation of any sign for which the value has been paid to the owner by an government or government agency in conjunction with a road widening project. No sign shall be relocated pursuant to this subsection before such time as the sign owner shall provide to the director a signed cop of the purchase contract or condemnation documents showing transfer of the owner's land for road widening.
C.
In all use districts, signs that were:
1.
Illegally erected or maintained with respect to prior ordinances,
2.
Made of paper, cloth, or nondurable materials, except yard signs,
3.
Located in the public right-of-way, shall be prohibited by this article and shall be removed by the owner. Upon failure to comply with requirements of this article, the director may cause the removal of such signs at the expense of the owner.
D.
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or demountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.
E.
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs such as electrical repairs or lettering repairs shall be allowed. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size, shape or technology of a sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. Signs damaged by fire or act of God may be restored to their original condition.
F.
Existing billboards on state and federal highways within the city that were legally erected, but which become nonconforming as a result of this article or prior sign ordinances are allowed to remain until purchased by the state department of transportation or the city or voluntarily removed by the owner, provided that the sign owner meets the requirements of state laws, rules and regulations governing such signs, including periodic maintenance to keep the sign from becoming dilapidated. The city finds that it is in the interest of the city that such nonconforming billboards be phased out of existence as they near the end of their useful life. The city further finds that the limited presence of some billboards along state and federal highways is useful in promoting local business, community events and other ideas within the city and the most efficient means of such promotion is through the limited use of digital billboards. The city, therefore, adopts a limited exchange program for nonconforming billboards in exchange for the right to erect one new digital billboard. The owner of any nonconforming billboard located within 150 feet of and oriented toward state or federal highways in the city may apply for a permit to replace such billboard with a new digital billboard meeting the standards of section 7.08.A.6.d. The condition for issuance of a replacement permit is the agreement by the applicant to remove, without cost to the city or state, one additional billboard also located within the city limits of Douglasville and to reserve one message segment per sign face for community use for a minimum of four weeks per year. Such community use need not be continuous and may be spread throughout the year at the sign owner's discretion. The sign owner shall institute a system for receiving requests for community use on behalf of the citizens of Douglasville and shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this condition.
G.
Each nonconforming sign shall be registered with 90 days of the enactment of this article by the owner, and if it is determined that such nonconforming sign was legally erected under the prior ordinance or resolution requirements, then a sign permit shall be issued to the sign owner and the sign so marked with the permit decal. Should the owner of a nonconforming sign fail to register such sign within 90 days from the enactment of this article, such failure to register shall be deemed a violation of this article, and such person shall be subject to citation in the municipal court.
H.
Existing signs on property of newly annexed territory that were legally erected under the county ordinance which would become nonconforming under this section upon annexation by the city will be allowed to remain. Such signs shall be registered with the city within 90 days of being annexed by the city.
( Ord. No. O-2022-8 , § 16, 3-7-22)
Sec. 7.15. - Enforcement.
A.
Enforcement responsibility. The community development director is responsible for general administration and enforcement of this article; the receipt, review and processing of all applications for sign permits and uniform sign plans, and of securing compliance with its terms.
B.
Citations. Any violation of this article may be tried upon a citation issued by the director or any other authorized representative of the city pursuant to the provisions of this article and state law. Without limitation, businesses, organizations, builders, developers, contractors, property owners, and such other parties responsible for the violation may be cited for violation of any provisions of this article.
C.
Removal of illegal signs. The director may order the removal of any sign in violation of this article by written notice to the permit holder; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit was issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. The removal order shall be issued only after the appropriate party fails to respond or otherwise comply within ten business days after the City gives written notice of non-compliance.
1.
Procedure following removal order. An aggrieved party may appeal the removal order within five business days from the date that the notice was mailed in accordance with section 7.03(I), sign permit.
2.
Removal without notice.
a.
The director or any other agent of the city having jurisdiction under the circumstances may remove or direct the removal of any sign in violation of this article, without giving notice to any party, if:
1)
Said sign is illegally placed upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or
2)
Said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public.
b.
Following such removal, the city may collect the costs as provided in the following subsection (C)(3), costs of removal, below.
3.
Costs of removal.
a.
Removal of any sign found in violation shall be without liability to the City, its officers, agents, and employees. The permit holder shall be primarily responsible for the costs of removal. If there is no permit holder, then the sign owner shall be responsible. If the sign owner cannot be determined, then the costs of removal shall be the responsibility of any party that procured the erection of the sign.
b.
If payment or arrangement to make payment is not made within 60 days after the receipt of a statement of removal costs, the community development director shall certify the amount thereof for collection to the city attorney.
c.
Costs of removal shall be charged in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the mayor and city council from time to time, or at the actual cost to the city.
