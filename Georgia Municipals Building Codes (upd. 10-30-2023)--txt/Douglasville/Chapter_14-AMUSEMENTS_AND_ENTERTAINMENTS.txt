ARTICLE IV. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 14-100. - Purpose.
The intent of the city council in enacting this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values, on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This ordinance is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. Instead, this article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
