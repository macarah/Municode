(C)
Access to adjacent properties.
(1)
Where, in the opinion of the county, it is desirable to provide for street access to an adjoining property, proposed roadways shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and joined with the existing roadways where such exists or with other proposed roadways. Where no roadway exists or where the adjoining property is in alignment with a proposed roadway, a temporary turnaround shall be provided at the boundary of said property.
(2)
In the event adjacent properties are separated by a watercourse or stream and where the adjoining property line runs to a centerline of the stream or watercourse, the County Engineer/County Road Department shall require that street access to adjoining property be provided. The first subdivider shall construct the streets to the edge of the stream or watercourse and shall provide sufficient bond or escrow account to adequately cover one-half the estimated cost of the proposed public crossing facility. Such bond or escrow account shall be held by Clay County for a period not to exceed two years.

Where subdivisions are developed abutting existing, dedicated or platted streets whose rights-of-way are inadequate, the developer shall make available to Clay County at fair market value the additional rights-of-way necessary to meet the minimum standards of these regulations. The necessary additional rights-of-way width shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plats.

(F)
Street names.
(1)
