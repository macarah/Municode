  (Res. No. 2005-14, 7-5-05)
Sec. 14-133. - General design and development requirements.
(a)
Suitability of land. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for use shall not be developed for a recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle park use or for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or property destruction or the environment unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Properties affected by the county's environmental planning standards shall also be identified and appropriately protected in the development review process. Lands deemed un-developable are found as portions of a large number of development projects, and shall be set aside as protected open space.
(b)
Land area and frontage requirements. A recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle development shall have a minimum of five contiguous acres and a total property width of at least 200 feet in order to allow for a minimum of two tiers of lots. The property shall be a minimum contiguous width of 60 feet wide where it directly abuts a paved public street or a class I street. A recreational vehicle park development shall be accessed by a public street, class I street, or a previously approved access of at least a 30-foot easement (a private street). The 30-foot easement must meet minimum subdivision regulations.
(c)
Name of the development. The name of the development must have been approved by the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing development or subdivision.
(d)
Lot size and frontage requirements.
(1)
Except as to seasonal worker lots as set out in subsection (2) below, each recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle lot designed for rental use shall have a minimum width of 80 feet and shall directly abut an interior street. Each rental lot shall have a minimum area of at least 10,000 square feet. Lots designated as lots for sale where urban scale public water is provided shall have a minimum lot area of at least one-acre minimum, or greater, sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site. Lots proposed for sale where no public water is available shall be on a central system and shall be a minimum lot width of 150 feet, and shall directly abut an interior street. Said lots shall contain at least one acre of area minimum or greater sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site.
(2)
Up to eight lots for seasonal workers shall be allowed. Seasonal worker lots shall be specifically located together in a single location and shall abut an interior street. Seasonal worker lots shall have a width no less than 30 feet and a length no less than 100 feet. Said sites shall be for temporary seasonal use for park workers and not to be rented for customer use. The area for seasonal worker lots shall contain an area sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site approved by the county health department.
(e)
Parking. Off street parking shall be provided at the rate of one parking space per site. This is in addition to the area set aside for the recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle.
(f)
Recreation and other community facilities. Not less than 15 percent of the total area of the rental development shall be devoted to recreation and other community facilities for those all recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle parks.
(g)
Setbacks. No recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle or other building or structure shall be located closer than 30 feet to any perimeter park boundaries, and no closer than five feet from any individual lot boundary line. Building setbacks for parks developed after April 3, 2007 shall be 30 feet to any perimeter park boundary; all other lot setbacks shall be 15 feet. Setbacks shall apply to the recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle and any slide outs, when fully extended, buildings, structures and fuel supply apparatuses.
(h)
Location permits and propane tank limitations. Location permits are required before placement of any recreational vehicle park/recreational vehicle to insure that the setbacks dictated in this division are met. Initial sighting of a recreational vehicle on any individually owned lot will require the staking of the lot corners to simplify inspection. These initial location or placement requirements are placed on both the individual property owners and the developer/homeowners association. Building inspection staff shall also insure compliance with the county's propane tank number/size limitations at the final sighting inspection. The county hereby prohibits any more than three 40-pound (approximate 10 gallon each) freestanding propane tanks on any RV site, including those for gas grills, exterior gas lighting and other such uses. Tanks installed by the manufacturer subject to ANSI standards are not subject to these limitations. Location of allowed propane and other fuel storage containers shall be subject to the RV setback requirements. Location inspection fees shall be as established from time to time by the county board of commissioners.
(i)
Perimeter screening required. A landscape buffer consisting of dense evergreen trees and/or shrubs and having a minimum depth of ten feet along all property lines shall be required. A minimum of a six-foot high, opaque fence or wall may be erected along the perimeter in lieu of such landscaped buffer. Landscape screening shall include evergreen plants that will obtain a height of six feet within four years. The owner(s) and/or developer shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of any trees and/or shrubbery used for perimeter screening. Installation of the required buffer is required prior to the issuance of any initial building or location permits.
(j)
Covenants. If covenants are proposed for the development, they must be submitted with the final plat. If no covenants are to be placed upon the project, a letter to that effect must be submitted for the project file.
(k)
Structures and buildings. No permanent buildings and non-motorized vehicles, except those falling under the definition of recreational park trailer and/or recreational vehicles shall be permitted on any rental lot. No buildings shall be allowed on rental lots and structures consisting of open decks may be allowed on rental lots not to exceed 200 square feet, or ten percent of the lot area, whichever is less. If the lots are sold for individual ownership, permanent buildings shall be limited to 400 square feet. Structures consisting of open decks may be allowed up to an additional 400 square feet or 20 percent of the lot area, whichever is greater. All buildings shall not be used for permanent habitation. Construction of any building or structure shall require a location or placement review for compliance with setback requirements as part of the footing inspection, which shall be handled in the same manner as detailed in section 14-128(a).
(l)
Use of impervious surface materials. One of the major challenges faced in RV parks, due to their compact nature, is the control of stormwater runoff and protecting areas of the park on both individual lots and in common spaces to promote infiltration of rainwater and stormwater, as well as wastewater effluent. Due to this special need identified in this compact development type, impervious surface, which is recommended primarily for parking pads, shall be limited to 20 percent of total lot area. The use of gravel and other porous materials is strongly encouraged in lieu of paving whenever feasible.
(m)
Health department approval. all final plans must have health department approval and must show the approval stamp from that department prior to the filing of the final development plan/plat.
(n)
Public works approval. All final plans must have public works/engineering approval and must show the approval stamp from that department prior to the filing of the final development plan/plat.
