If said plat is in conformance with the preliminary plat and is approved by the administrative officer, the signatures of the administrative officer shall be placed on the reproducible film copy or original plat.
Section 516. - Recording of final plats.
Upon approval and without undue delay, the administrative officer shall have approved final plats recorded in the records of the clerk of the superior court of the county, and a time-stable reproducible film copy or original shall be filed in the office of the administrative officer.

The clerk of the superior court shall indicate on the filed copy, as well as the time-stable reproducible film copy or original, the book and page number in the county records where the final plat is recorded.

Section 518. - Lot combinations and boundary line adjustments.
Boundary line adjustments. One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the administrative officer and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the administrative officer and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots.
Lot combinations. An existing lot line forming the boundary between two conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged, by the developer, to form one building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the final plat requirements of this resolution. Where separate parcels or lots of land are proposed to be combined, they shall be submitted to the administrative officer as a final plat for review, approval and recording. In the case where no recorded final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the administrative officer and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots.
