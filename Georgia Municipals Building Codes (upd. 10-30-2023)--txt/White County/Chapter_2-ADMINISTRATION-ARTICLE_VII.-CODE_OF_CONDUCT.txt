ARTICLE VII. - CODE OF CONDUCT[7]

--- (7) ---
Editor's note— Res. No. 2003-17, §§ I—III, adopted April 1, 2003, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence its inclusion herein as article VII, sections 2-271—2-273, was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-271. - Conduct during meetings.
During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, elected officials of the county shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the chair;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed sessions.
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ________?" or "Do you remember telling me ________?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ________," or "Why did you tell me ________ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a meeting is to allow each elected official, town representatives and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out to public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by an elected official during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by an elected official during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the commission as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, an elected official shall not state that the commission will or will not do something, nor shall an elected official state what the commission's vote will be on an issue. No single elected official can speak on behalf of the commission unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so.
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the commission. By way of example, an elected official is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, an elected official shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when an elected official will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If an elected official is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the commission, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
(Res. No. 2003-17, § I, 4-1-03; Res. No. 2007-1, § I, 1-9-07)
Sec. 2-272. - Conduct outside of meetings.
An elected official of commission shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county administrator. Once such a request is made, the elected official shall follow up with the county administrator regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the elected official expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the elected official's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county administrator first; if the elected official is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the commission in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single elected official has the authority to hire or fire county personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any county employee. If an elected official believes a county employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the county administrator. If an elected official believes the county administrator should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the commission. No single elected official has the authority to discipline county personnel.
(4)
Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in subsection (1), above.
(6)
Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the elected official's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the elected official schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the elected official shall honor that request.
(7)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the county commission.
(8)
Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the county commission. By way of example, it is permissible for any elected official to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against the county by the parties involved). However, an elected official shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that elected official has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the county commission. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in an elected official's district is of no consequence, as an elected official has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(9)
Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the county or the commission without advance approval by majority vote of the commission. By way of example, an elected official is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, an elected official shall not make a statement in the name of the county commission or in the name of the county unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the county commission.
(10)
Speak with any other commissioner about county business outside of a regular work session or regular commission meeting that is in any way in violation of the "Sunshine Law of the State of Georgia." This in no way prevents two or more commissioners from being together at social functions or being together without others present, as long as what is commonly called the Sunshine Law of the State of Georgia is not violated.
(Res. No. 2003-17, § II, 4-1-03; Res. No. 2007-1, § II, 1-9-07)
Sec. 2-273. - Penalties.
The county commission shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this resolution. Any elected official shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this resolution to the attention of the full commission. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the commission present. If the commission determines by majority vote that a violation of this resolution has occurred, the commission shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending elected official:
(1)
A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration;
(2)
A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
(3)
Removal of the elected official from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending elected official is involved in his capacity as a county elected official; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the commission, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending elected official is no longer authorized to represent the county. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offense.
(4)
A fine, not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending elected official to the general fund of the county within ten days of the commission's vote establishing a violation; if the offending elected official fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending elected official's compensation as an elected official.
The decision of the county commission on any question concerning a violation of this article, or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being the express intent of all the elected officials to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.
