ARTICLE XV. - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT, I

Section 1500. - Purpose and intent.
The Industrial District is established with the purpose of reserving certain areas with relatively level topography, adequate provision of water and sewerage facilities, and access to state highway and county arterial routes for industrial and manufacturing operations, but where such areas' proximity to residential and other districts makes it desirable to limit such operations to those areas that are not objectionable by reason of the emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors or radiation, and that do not create fire or explosion or chemical hazards or other objectionable conditions. Uses within this district do not require substantial quantities of water for manufacturing operations and do not necessarily rail, air or water transportation. Certain commercial uses having an open storage characteristic, or which are most appropriately located as neighbors of industrial uses are also included within this district. All uses within this district shall be setback and buffered a minimum of 100 feet from all residential and agricultural districts.
This district also includes a number of businesses and establishments uses that require a special use permit (SUP) from the White County Commission. Uses requiring special use permits are those that would not be appropriate without restrictions and is not permitted by right or conditionally, but allowed through regulations as to the number, area, location, relation to neighborhoods, operations or other pertinent considerations and specification/criteria as specified in this Code.
