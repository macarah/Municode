State Law reference— Limitation on penalties, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6(a)(2).
Sec. 8-50. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person;
(2)
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system;
(3)
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and
(4)
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(Code 2003, § 21-202(1); Ord. of 10-2-2006(3))
Sec. 8-51. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(6)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(7)
Therefore, the City of Porterdale adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

(6)

(7)
If the City of Porterdale has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City of Porterdale is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the City of Porterdale may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
