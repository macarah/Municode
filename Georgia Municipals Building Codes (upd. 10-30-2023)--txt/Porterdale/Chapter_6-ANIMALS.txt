A single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more person, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation." Provided, however, that if any single building (as defined in section 119-2) contains more than one dwelling unit, then no more than two animals may be kept or housed in or upon the grounds of each dwelling unit contained within the single structure.

The purpose of this subsection is to provide a "grandfathering" provision for those owners who are keeping or housing more than three animals as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, so as not to require any such owners to dispose of an animal to comply with the limitation on the number of animals per dwelling unit created by this section.

Examples of animals normally kept as collections or in groups are fish, reptiles or amphibians in home aquariums, or decorative ponds, rodents such as hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, or mice, and birds such as finches or parakeets kept in cages.

No wild animal shall be kept as a pet or confined unless specifically licensed by the state department of natural resources.
(6)
Animals allowed in agricultural zoning districts (AG-G) are exempt from this limitation.

Time limit within which to dispose of animal litters. From and after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, any owner whose animal bears a litter such that the number of animals in the owner's dwelling unit is increased beyond the limitation of three created under subsection (a)(1) of this section, or beyond the number of animals registered by the owner under the "grandfather" provision of subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall have 90 days within which to dispose of the excess number of animals above the limit of three animals per dwelling unit. This exception is not intended to allow the commercial or frequent breeding of animals, which is prohibited in RR, R1, R2, R3, and MU zoning districts.
