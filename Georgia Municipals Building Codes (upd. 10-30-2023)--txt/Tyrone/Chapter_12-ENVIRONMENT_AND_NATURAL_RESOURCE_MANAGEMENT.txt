(Ord. No. 480, § 1(2), 12-1-2005)
Sec. 12-20. - Description.
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or nonpolluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the town with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities.
(Ord. No. 480, § 1, 12-1-2005)
Sec. 12-21. - Findings.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the town separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(2)
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the town separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(3)
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the town separate storm sewer system.
(6)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the town separate storm sewer system.
(b)
Therefore, the town adopted this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the town separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the town separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(Ord. No. 480, § 1, 12-1-2005)
Sec. 12-22. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the town separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law.

(4)
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(b)
Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the area of the town.
(c)

The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator.
(g)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the town access to a facility is a violation of the provisions of this article.
(h)
If the town has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the town is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of the provisions of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the town manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Nutrient means a substance or combination of substances which, if added to waters in sufficient quantities, provides nourishment that promotes growth of aquatic vegetation in densities which:
(1)
Interfere with use of the waters by humans or by any animal, fish, or plant useful to humans; or

Sec. 12-60. - Declaration of policy.
O.C.G.A. § 12-5-27.1 makes it unlawful to sell at retail or use in this state certain cleaning agents containing phosphorus.
