Payment by the water service provider will be made upon completion and satisfactory inspection of the work and upon receipt of a maintenance bond equal to ten percent of the cost of the construction of the water to ten percent of the cost of the construction of the water facility. The developer may provide a letter of escrow or letter of credit acceptable in lieu of the maintenance bond required in this section. An eight-inch main will be considered as the minimum size main required to supply a development of any size.

(7)
If required corrections are not made within 30 days of notice, the water service provider shall have the authority to make these corrections at the expense of the bonding company. In cases where funds are being held under letter of credit or letter of escrow, the cost of making these corrections shall be drawn by the water service provider from these funds, and the developer charged with any costs above the amount of such funds.
(8)
The water service provider shall have full authority to inspect, test and sterilize all water mains installed under this section.

For combined potable and fire line users who provide a specific means of determining the requirements of the development, such as by the installation of private meters by the owner, the service charge shall be based on the number and size of private meters installed.
(2)
Commodity. All classifications of users except fire line shall be billed a commodity charge in addition to a service charge on the basis of actual volume of water delivered at the single unit volume rate set by the water service provider.

b.
Where an owner elects to dedicate lines and rights-of-way outside the public road right-of-way in order to utilize multiple meters and where such lines have hydrants installed or serve building sprinkler systems, the owner will be billed for fire service availability on the basis of diameter of connection required to the system mains for fire protection only and on the number of fire hydrants. There will be no charge, however, for any hydrant which is determined to be adjacent to and available to a public roadway.
