(Ord. No. 2014-12-05, § 1(14-33), 12-16-2014)
Sec. 14-26. - Issuance of notice of violation; variances; time period for correction; appeals.
(a)
Notice of violation. Whenever the community development director determines that development activity or inactivity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, that approved and required erosion and sedimentation control facilities or devices have been altered, damaged or destroyed, or that any other activities violate the provisions of this article, the community development director shall issue a notice of violation. Whenever the community development director determines that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, the community development director or designee shall issue a notice of violation. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to any other penalty provisions applicable to this article. The notice of violation of the provisions of this article or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto shall be addressed to the owner of the property or the owner's agent and to the person, tenant, firm, corporation, property owner or property owner's agent found to be violating the provisions of this article and shall:
(1)
Be in writing;
(2)
Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred;
(3)
List the specific provisions of this article which have been violated;
(4)
State that, if these repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the inspector, summons shall be issued for the person, firm, corporation, owner, or owner's agent to appear in municipal court. However, in the judgment of the community development director, where the violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this article or constitutes a public health and safety hazard or endangers the ecosystem, the community development director may issue a court summons in lieu of a notice of violation.
(b)
Penalty. It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended. Any person, firm or corporation that shall do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended, upon conviction of a violation in municipal court shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment in accordance with section 1-11. Where any offense or violation continues from day-to-day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, engineer, contractor, or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits, or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(c)
Variances.
(1)
Except as further limited herein, an applicant may request a variance from the terms of the requirements of sections 14-28, 14-29 and article IV of this chapter. The community development director shall have no power to consider or to grant variances which are the responsibility of the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and other relevant state statutes and regulations. Where variances involving the same project are requested from both the director of the EPD and the community development director, the community development director shall take no action on any such request for variance until the director of the EPD grants the variance or otherwise approves the request pending before the EPD. Receiving a variance from the director of the EPD does not obligate the community development director to permit the project to proceed if the project does not also meet all the other requirements of this article. No variance from the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized except as specifically authorized in this section or specifically authorized in another section of this chapter.
(2)
Applications for variances authorized in subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be made in writing to the community development director and shall contain all of those materials and documents required by the community development director that are necessary to demonstrate that the request meets the criteria for granting variances.
(3)
In considering a request for a variance to the terms of this article authorized in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the community development director shall use all of the following criteria:
a.
The request, while not strictly meeting the requirements of this chapter, will in the judgment of the community development director be at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as would a plan which met the strict application of these requirements. In making such a judgment, the community development director shall examine whether the request will be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment with regard to the following factors:
1.
Stream bank or soil stabilization;
2.
Trapping of sediment in surface runoff;
3.
Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants from surface runoff;
4.
Terrestrial habitat, food chain, and migration corridor;
5.
Buffering of flood flows;
6.
Infiltration of surface runoff;
7.
Noise and visual buffers;
8.
Downstream water quality; and
9.
Impact on threatened and endangered species, as those species are designated by law or federal or state regulation.
b.
By reason of exceptional topographic or other relevant physical conditions of the subject property that were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a variance is granted.
c.
The request does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties that are similarly situated.
d.
The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located.
e.
The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this chapter would cause an extreme hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the owner.
(4)
The community development director's decision shall be in writing, shall state the basis for the decision, and shall be made no more than 30 days following application.
(d)
Appeals.
(1)
Generally. Appeals shall be made to the board of appeals, as established in chapter 27 of this Code, and shall be administered in accordance with the notice requirements, criteria and procedural requirements set forth therein, except as otherwise specified below.
(2)
Basis for appeal. Whenever the community development director approves a variance pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and it is alleged that the variance request did not meet the standards of the section, or where the community development director denies a variance request pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and it is alleged that the variance request did meet the standards of the section, or where it is alleged by the applicant that there is an error in any final order, requirement, or final decision made by an administrative official based on or made in the interpretation or enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved person, or any city official, department, board or agency affected by the order, requirement or decision, shall have the right to appeal the final order, requirement or decision to the board of appeals.
(3)
Initiation of appeal. Appeals shall be made by filing with the secretary of the board of appeals an application for appeal specifying the grounds thereof, within 30 days after the action appealed from was taken.
(4)
Appeal stays all legal proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the superior court of the county on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
(5)
Time and notice of hearing. The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing of the appeal and shall give notice thereof pursuant to the requirements of section 27-1666.
(6)
Decision of the board of appeals. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the board of appeals shall make a determination on each appeal. The board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but in no event more than 60 days from the date of the final hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an express finding by the board of appeals that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the board of appeals may reserve or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met.
(e)

(1)
Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the board of appeals, or any officer, department, board or agency affected by such decision, may seek review of such decision by petitioning the superior court of the county for a writ of certiorari, setting forth plainly the alleged errors. Such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision of the board of appeals is rendered.
(2)
In any such petition filed, the board of appeals shall be designated the respondent in certiorari and city shall be designated the defendant in certiorari. The secretary of the board of appeals shall be authorized to acknowledge service of a copy of the petition and writ for the board of appeals as respondent. Service upon the city as defendant shall be as otherwise provided by law. Within the time prescribed by law, the board of appeals shall cause to be filed with the clerk of the county superior court a duly certified record of the proceedings had before the board, including a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if any, and the decision of the board.
(f)
Private agreements, covenants, and restrictions. This article is not intended to abrogate, annul or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or other private agreement or legal relationship provided that when the regulations of this article are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements or legal relationships, the regulations of this article shall govern. Further, where there is a conflict between any standard or requirement within this chapter, or between the standards of this chapter and any other provision of the Code, the more restrictive standard or requirement shall apply.

Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b)(4)b and c of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design by phases, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director of the environmental protection division (EPD) or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(4)b.2 of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
2.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the EPD. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
3.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
4.
The director of the EPD may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the BNR, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
5.
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15 and 16, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
c.
Rules and regulations governing land-disturbing activities. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, at a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1.
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2.
Cut-fill operations shall be kept to a minimum;
3.
Development plans shall conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
4.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented as provided in articles III and V of this chapter;
5.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
6.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
8.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
9.
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
10.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11.
Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property;
12.
Fills shall not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13.
Grading equipment shall cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediment on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(4)b.2 of this section;
15.
Except as provided in subsection (b)(4)c.16 of this section, there is established a 25-foot state buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director of the EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director of the EPD as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
(i)
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and
(ii)
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
A.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
B.
Stream crossings for sewer lines;
16.
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the BNR, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director of the EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
(i)
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
(ii)
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
A.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
B.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
d.
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (4)(b), (c) of this section.
e.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.
(5)
Application/permit process.
a.
Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner or operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
b.
Application requirements.
1.
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of city without first obtaining a permit from the community development department to perform such activity, and providing a copy of the notice of intent, if applicable, to the EPD.
2.
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the community development department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, at a minimum, the data specified in subsection (b)(5)c of this section. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 391-3-7-.10).
3.
A permitting fee, as determined by the city council shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
4.
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
5.
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the community development department. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15 and 16 of this section and bonding if required by subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if city and the district enter into an agreement which allows city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
6.
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the community development department may deny the permit application.
7.
The community development department may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city manager may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
c.
Plan requirements.
1.
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection (b)(4)b and c of this section, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
2.
Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted.
d.
Permits.
1.
Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but, in any event, not later than 45 days after receipt by the community development department of a completed application, provided variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary; no permit may be issued unless all applicable fees have been paid.
2.
Time limitation of application. An application for a land disturbance permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned 90 days from the issuance of the most recent review comments provided by the city. The city engineer is authorized to grant up to three written extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each before such application is declared abandoned. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.
3.
No permit shall be issued by the community development department unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the community development department has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15 and 16 of this section are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of city are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
4.
Any land-disturbing activity by the governing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this section, and any other ordinances relating to land development as are applied to private persons, and the community development director shall enforce such requirements upon the governing authority.
5.
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
6.
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
7.
No permit shall be issued until the applicant files documents with the community development department demonstrating compliance with all applicable local, state and federal requirements.
8.
A development permit shall be valid for two years from its issuance subject to the following provisions:
(i)
If the work authorized in any development permit has not begun within 90 days from the date of issuance thereof, the permit shall expire.
(ii)
If the work described in any development permit has not been substantially completed within two years of the date of issuance thereof, the permit shall expire.
(iii)
Written notice of the expiration shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that further work as described in the canceled permit shall not proceed until a new development permit has been obtained.
(iv)
The city engineer is authorized to grant one written extension of a development permit for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.
(v)
The director of community development is authorized to grant one additional written extension of a development permit for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.
(vi)
All additional extension requests shall be heard by city council. Extension requests shall be submitted in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated at least 30 days prior to the permit expiration date. The extension request will be placed on the next available city council agenda.
(6)
Inspection and enforcement.
a.
The community development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbance activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person by the community development department. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this section.
b.
The community development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may reasonably be necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
c.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or the division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
d.
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of the city. The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to city for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the city's erosion and sedimentation control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if the city's program is found to be deficient or ineffective.
e.
The division may periodically review the actions of the city which has been certified as a local issuing authority pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of city's ordinances and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and city. If such review indicates that city has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the city governing authority in writing. Upon receipt of the notification, the governing authority shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the city does not take necessary action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of city as a local issuing authority.
(7)
Penalties and incentives.
a.
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining the permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within unincorporated city.
b.
Stop work orders. Upon notice from the community development department or other city-authorized representative, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required.
1.
For the first and second violations of the provisions of this section on a site, the community development department shall issue a written notice of violation. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the community development department shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state, the community development department shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning.
2.
For a third and each subsequent violation on a site, the community development department shall issue an immediate stop work order; and
3.
All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
4.
When a violation in the form of land disturbance without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the community development department, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the community development department. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
c.
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served by the community development department upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section. The city manager may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
d.
Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this section, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this section, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the community development department issued as provided in this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 per day, and may be subject to the provisions of section 1-11. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate offense.
(8)
Education and certification.
a.
Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection of any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
b.
For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of the entity or person; the persons shall meet the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission, and maintain evidence of the certification present whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on the site. A project shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site, or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale, permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit.
c.
Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit, but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site, may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this section.
d.
If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(4), but shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in the paragraph.
(9)
Administrative appeal, judicial review.
a.
Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the city upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to an appeal before the board of appeals pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in section 14-26(d).
b.
Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by administrative appeals from a decision or order of the board of appeals authorized by subsection (b)(9)a of this section shall be as provided for in section 14-26(d).
(10)
Liability.
a.
Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this section nor the compliance with provisions of this section shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon city, the district, its officers or employees for damage to any person or property.
b.
The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.
c.
No provision of this section shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.
