ARTICLE V. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 27-368. - Purpose and intent.
As the name implies, overlay zoning districts "overlay" applicable base zoning district classifications to alter some or all of the base zoning regulations that apply to particular sites. Overlay districts work to modify or supplement the regulations imposed by base zoning district when necessary to address special situations or accomplish specific objectives. Overlay zoning is intended to be used when the base zoning applied to an area remains generally appropriate, but when an additional, modified or eliminated requirement could help implement the city's planning goals or address an area-specific planning, design or land use regulation issue.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.58), 11-27-2018)
Sec. 27-369. - Interpretation.
(a)
All applicable regulations of the underlying base zoning district apply to property in an overlay district unless otherwise expressly stated in the overlay district regulations.
(b)
When overlay regulations conflict with regulations that otherwise apply in the underlying base zoning district, the regulations of the applicable overlay govern. If property is classified in multiple overlay districts and the regulations of one overlay district conflict with the regulations of another overlay district, the more restrictive regulation governs.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.59), 11-27-2018)
Sec. 27-370. - Procedure.
The boundaries of overlay zoning districts shall be shown on the official zoning map. The following procedures apply to the establishment, amendment or termination of all overlay districts unless otherwise expressly stated.
(1)
Overlay district regulations shall be established, amended or terminated in accordance with the zoning ordinance text amendment procedures of article 10, division 2 of this chapter.
(2)
Except as otherwise expressly stated, zoning map amendments establishing, expanding or reducing the boundaries of an overlay district or terminating all or part of an overlay district shall be processed in accordance with the zoning map amendment procedures of article 10, division 2 of this chapter.

The landscape zone starts at the back of the curb and extends inward (toward the lot) for the minimum distance and no more than the maximum distance indicated in table 5-1. This area is generally intended to accommodate trees, plants, street furniture, lights, trash receptacles and similar streetscape elements.
(2)
The pedestrian zone starts at the inner edge of the landscape zone and extends inward (toward the lot) for the minimum distance and no more than the maximum distance indicated in table 5-1. This area, typically referred to as the "sidewalk," is intended exclusively to accommodate unimpeded pedestrian movement. The pedestrian zone may also be used to accommodate multi-use trails when the zone is at least ten feet in width.
(c)
The minimum width of required streetscapes varies by street type, in accordance with table 5-1.

  (d)
On existing streets with insufficient right-of-way width to accommodate the required streetscape elements, the right-of-way needed to accommodate the required streetscape elements may be expanded by mutual agreement between the owner of the abutting property and the entity controlling the subject right-of-way, or a public access easement may be provided to the city to accommodate the required streetscape elements.
(e)
Landscape zones.
(1)
Overstory trees shall be planted in all landscape zones spaced at a maximum distance of 30 feet on center or as approved by the city arborist.
(2)
New overstory trees shall be a minimum of three and one-half inches in caliper measured 12 inches above ground, shall be a minimum of 16 feet in height, shall have a minimum mature height of 30 feet and shall be limbed up to a minimum height of eight feet.
(3)
Overstory trees shall have a minimum planting area of four feet by eight feet. Tree planting areas shall provide porous drainage systems that allow for drainage of the planting area.
(4)
Overstory tree species shall be consistent for the entire length of the subject block face. Species are permitted to change on individual block faces only in cases of limited supply and/or concerns regarding disease or the health of existing and proposed trees. Such changes require review and approval by the community development director, after consultation with a certified arborist.
(5)
All planting and plant removal activity within required landscape zones, other than routine maintenance, requires review and approval by the community development director.
(6)
Street lights shall be located within the landscape zone spaced at a maximum distance of 60 feet on center on the following streets: Buford Highway, North Druid Hills Rd., Briarcliff Rd., Clairmont Rd., Briarwood Rd. and Cliff Valley Way.
(7)
Benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks shall be placed within the landscape zone on the following streets: Buford Highway, North Druid Hills Road, Briarcliff Road, Clairmont Road, Briarwood Road and Cliff Valley Way. Such features shall be provided at a ratio of not less than one bench, one trash receptacle, and one bike rack per 300 feet of street frontage, or portion thereof. Bike racks provided to meet this requirement may be counted towards satisfying bicycle parking requirements of this chapter. These streetscape elements may incorporate functional art and should include trash recycle containers similar to BigBelly that can incorporate art and graphic displays while contributing to the City's sustainability goals. Developers shall work collaboratively with the community development director or their designee and the ACC which will provide assistance and guidance regarding appropriate elements and which can offer a list of artists and others who are available for collaboration on art elements. This process shall run concurrently with the standard permitting process.
(8)
Landscape zones shall be planted with grass, ground cover or flowering plants, or consist of brick pavers, concrete pavers, or granite pavers where on-street parking is provided or pedestrian crossing and/or congregation is likely. Applicants are encouraged to incorporate green design considerations and eco-art into landscaping and drainage designs wherever possible. Many times, these requirements add only insignificant cost to a project as they simply require looking at standard engineering and landscape design through a design/art lens.
(f)
Pedestrian zones.
(1)
Pedestrian zones shall be paved in concrete and kept clear and unobstructed for the safe and convenient use of pedestrians. For all internal (privately-owned) sidewalk paving, the ACC and the community development director or designee shall work with the developer to provide assistance for incorporating arts elements such as sidewalk poetry or artwork that may be incorporated into final installations. This assistance can include:
a.
Offering design suggestions and best practices information.
b.
Providing an open source list of local artists, artisans, and fabricators who may be engaged by the developer to meet these requirements.
c.
Reviewing developer concepts to offer feedback and guidance.
d.
Coordination with other city departments that may have jurisdiction to ensure that all requirements are in alignment and do not delay the permitting process.
(2)
All sidewalk paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent pedestrian zone area.
(3)
Pedestrian zones paved with materials other than concrete may be allowed with the approval of the community development director.
(4)
When newly constructed sidewalks abut existing adjacent sidewalks located within the boundaries of the /BHO district, the newly constructed sidewalk shall provide safe facilitation of pedestrian traffic flow to adjacent sidewalks. When newly constructed sidewalks abut existing adjacent sidewalks that are not located within the boundaries of the /BHO district, the newly constructed sidewalk shall provide safe facilitation of pedestrian traffic flow to adjacent sidewalks by tapering to match the width of the existing sidewalks, except if no adjacent sidewalk exists, the new sidewalk shall taper to match the widths identified in section 14-677 of the city code. Any development that disturbs existing sidewalks on an adjacent property shall replace disturbed areas to their pre-disturbance state and condition.
(5)
Safe and convenient pedestrian pathways shall be provided from sidewalks along streets to each publicly accessible building entrance, including pedestrian access routes to parking decks and through parking lots and between adjacent buildings within the same development. All such pathways shall be paved, with a minimum width of three feet or the width required by the underlying zoning district or ADA accessibility criteria, whichever width is greater.

Residential buildings on O-I, OCR, or X-zoned lots located south of I-85 within the boundaries of the /BHO district may be up to eight stories in height. Parking decks accessory to such uses may not exceed eight stories in height. All other buildings are subject to the regulations of subsection (b) of this section.
(b)
To help implement the development intensities recommended in the Buford Highway Corridor Character Area of the comprehensive plan, buildings on properties within the /BHO district may exceed the maximum applicable building height limit of the underlying zoning district if approved through the special land use permit procedures of article 10, division 3 of this chapter. This provision does not apply to the buildings and uses specified in subsection (a) of this section.
(c)
To help implement the development intensities recommended in the Buford Highway Corridor Character Area of the comprehensive plan, residential and mixed-use buildings on properties within the /BHO district may exceed the maximum applicable density limit of the underlying zoning district if approved through the special and use permit procedures of article 10, division 3 of this chapter.

Sec. 27-389. - Utilities.
(a)
Purpose and intent. It is the intent and purpose of this section to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens as well as the aesthetics and quality of life of the City of Brookhaven by the establishment, herein, of standards and procedures for burying of existing overhead utilities as new developments are constructed and where significant redevelopment occurs. This section, therefore, establishes minimum requirements for placement of overhead utilities underground. While there are considerations to balance difficulties of urban development with the desires of the city, where questions of intent arise the purpose of this section is to ensure that said utilities are in fact buried in the majority of instances.
(b)
Applicability. Utilities, including telephone, electric power, and cable television in both public and private rights-of-way, shall be placed underground for all new developments with total floor areas exceeding 10,000 gross square feet, except when extreme conditions of underlying rock or other conditions prevent this requirement from being met or as provided in paragraph (b) below, and only as approved by the director.
(c)
Exceptions. The following exceptions shall apply to this section:
(1)
Underground utilities shall not be required for developments with total floor areas of 10,000 gross square feet or less.
(2)
Transmission and main lines shall not be required to be placed underground.
(3)
Accessory mechanical systems and features such as electric distribution, transformers, switchgear, meter pedestals, telephone pedestals, terminals and other similar equipment, which is normally installed above ground in accordance with accepted utility practices for underground distribution systems may be installed.
(4)
Meters, service connections, and similar equipment normally attached to the outside wall of the premises it serves may be installed.
(5)
Overhead utility services for existing developments in place as of the effective date of this section may be repaired, replaced or increased in capacity.
(6)
Temporary overhead facilities required for construction purposes will be permitted.
(d)
Utility conversion fund. A city fund, known as the "The City of Brookhaven Utility Conversion Fund" is hereby created. The purpose of said fund is to accept deposits as described in paragraph (d) below, along with other funds or grants apportioned by the mayor and city council, and the use of such funds shall be restricted for the sole purpose of offsetting the cost of projects undertaken by the city to bury or relocate power lines from streets and sidewalks.
(e)
Fee-in-lieu. In cases where the expense to bury overhead utilities for new developments described in paragraph (a), above, is deemed to be unreasonably costly due to the complexity of the work, the developer may request approval from the director of a fee-in-lieu arrangement, whereby the developer shall make a contribution toward the City's Utility Conversion Fund in lieu of requiring burial of the utilities. Such fee-in-lieu arrangement shall be based on a cost per linear foot of such underground relocation of utilities established by the mayor and city council, as may be adjusted from time to time by city ordinance.
(f)
Accessory mechanical systems and features. Accessory mechanical systems, including utility meters, boxes, HVAC units, and other similar equipment shall not be located between the building and a public or private right-of-way. Efforts shall be taken to locate accessory mechanical system features including utility meters, boxes and other similar equipment so as to not be visible from the public or private right-of-way. When this is not possible or satisfied, as determined by the director, the following screening shall be required:
(1)
Roof-mounted systems. Roof-mounted systems shall be screened with an opaque wall constructed of materials similar to the primary building.
(2)
All other systems. Systems mounted on walls, ground, or elsewhere, shall be screened with an opaque wall constructed of materials similar to the primary building or sufficient landscaping to provide year-round screening.
(g)
Waiver of utility provisions.
(1)
The director may waive one or more of the requirements of this article, provided that the director makes the following findings with respect to the utility service to which the waiver pertains:
a.
That the property owner seeking the waiver has submitted justification of the waiver in writing;
b.
That two or more of the following criteria are met:
1.
The city arborist has determined that the new or expanded utility service, if placed underground, would endanger an existing specimen tree by damaging its root system;
2.
The new or expanded utility service, if placed overhead, would not be visible from a public or private street or any other public or private right-of-way;
3.
The new or expanded overhead utility service, if placed underground, would significantly interfere with one or more existing city or private underground utilities;
4.
If the waiver is granted, there would be a reduction in the total number of overhead utility service lines serving the owner's property;
5.
If the waiver is granted, the length of the overhead utility service to the owner's property would be less than the length of the service in existence at the time the application is made;
6.
The new, extended or relocated service or facility is required to provide additional street lighting to suppress criminal activity and that the waiver is requested or supported by the chief of police; and
7.
The new, extended or relocated service or facility would require boring under a state route and is restricted by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(2)
Any property owner whose application for a waiver under this section has been denied by the director may appeal the director's decision to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days of the director's denial. City council shall conduct a public hearing on any such appeal. In deciding the appeal, council shall determine whether good cause exists to grant the requested waiver; provided, that, in making this determination, council shall, in conjunction with an appeal involving a utility service, consider the decision factors set out above.

DIVISION 3. - /PRO, PEACHTREE ROAD OVERLAY

Sec. 27-401. - Scope.
This division establishes streetscape and access regulations for development within the boundaries of the Peachtree Road Overlay (/PRO) District. The overlay district is based upon the vision developed as part of the Brookhaven-Peachtree Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) plan. The LCI plan created a community vision and action plan for the development of a more dynamic mixed-use community with the character of a multistory, urban village surrounding the Brookhaven-Oglethorpe University MARTA Transit Station and the Peachtree Road corridor from Fulton County to Ashford-Dunwoody Road. Key goals of the LCI plan include support for a high-quality, multi-modal transportation system featuring spacious, tree-lined sidewalks, bicycle infrastructure, an interconnected street network and limitations on driveway access.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.71), 11-27-2018)
Sec. 27-402. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the /PRO district is as follows:
(1)
To implement the policies and objectives of the LCI plan, the comprehensive plan, Brookhaven City Centre Master plan and this zoning ordinance;
(2)
To facilitate access to:
a.
The Brookhaven-Oglethorpe University MARTA Transit Station; and
b.
Compatible and neighboring commercial, civic, recreational, institutional and residential areas; and

(3)
Overstory trees shall have a minimum planting area of four feet by eight feet. Tree planting areas shall provide porous drainage systems that allow for drainage of the planting area.
(4)
Overstory tree species shall be consistent for the entire length of the subject block face. Species are permitted to change on individual block faces only in cases of limited supply and/or concerns regarding disease or the health of existing and proposed trees. Such changes require review and approval by the community development director, after consultation with a certified arborist.
(5)
All planting and plant removal activity within required landscape zones, other than routine maintenance, requires review and approval by the community development director.
(6)
Street lights shall be located within the landscape zone spaced at a maximum distance of 60 feet on center on the following streets: Peachtree Road, Dresden Drive, North Druid Hills Road and Apple Valley Road.
(7)

Along Dresden Drive and Apple Valley Road, these streetscape elements shall incorporate functional art and should include trash recycle containers such as BigBelly or similar that can incorporate art and graphic displays while contributing to the city's sustainability goals. Developers shall work collaboratively with the community development director or designee and the ACC which will provide assistance and guidance regarding appropriate elements and which can offer a list of creatives and others who are available for collaboration on art elements. This process shall run concurrently with the standard permitting process.
(8)
Landscape zones shall be planted with grass, ground cover or flowering plants, or consist of brick pavers, concrete pavers, or granite pavers where on-street parking is provided or pedestrian crossing and/or congregation is likely. Applicants are encouraged to incorporate green design considerations and eco-art into landscaping and drainage designs wherever possible. Many times, these requirements add only insignificant cost to a project as they simply require looking at standard engineering and landscape design through a design/art lens.
(g)
Pedestrian zones.
(1)
Pedestrian zones shall be paved in concrete and kept clear and unobstructed for the safe and convenient use of pedestrians. For all internal (privately-owned) sidewalk paving, the ACC and the community development director or designee shall work with the developer to provide assistance for incorporating arts elements such as sidewalk poetry or artwork that may be incorporated into final installations. This assistance can include:
a.
Offering design suggestions and best practices information.
b.
Providing an open source list of local artists, artisans, and fabricators who may be engaged by the developer to meet these requirements.

All sidewalk paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent pedestrian zone area.
(3)
Pedestrian zones paved with materials other than concrete may be allowed with the approval of the community development director.
(4)
When newly constructed sidewalks abut existing adjacent sidewalks located within the boundaries of the /PRO district, the newly constructed sidewalk shall provide safe facilitation of pedestrian traffic flow to adjacent sidewalks. When newly constructed sidewalks abut existing adjacent sidewalks that are not located within the boundaries of the / PRO district, the newly constructed sidewalk shall provide safe facilitation of pedestrian traffic flow to adjacent sidewalks by tapering to match the width of the existing sidewalks, except if no adjacent sidewalk exists, the new sidewalk shall taper to match the widths identified in section 14-677 of the city code. Any development that disturbs existing sidewalks on an adjacent property shall replace disturbed areas to their pre-disturbance state and condition.
(5)
Safe and convenient pedestrian pathways shall be provided from sidewalks along streets to each publicly accessible building entrance, including pedestrian access routes to parking decks and through parking lots and between adjacent buildings within the same development. All such pathways shall be paved, with a minimum width of three feet or the width required by the underlying zoning district or ADA accessibility criteria, whichever width is greater.

Sec. 27-407. - Utilities.
(a)
Purpose and intent. It is the intent and purpose of this section to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens as well as the aesthetics and quality of life of the City of Brookhaven by the establishment, herein, of standards and procedures for burying of existing overhead utilities as new developments are constructed and where significant redevelopment occurs. This section, therefore, establishes minimum requirements for placement of overhead utilities underground. While there are considerations to balance difficulties of urban development with the desires of the city, where questions of intent arise the purpose of this section is to ensure that said utilities are in fact buried in the majority of instances.
(b)
Applicability. Utilities, including telephone, electric power, and cable television in both public and private rights-of-way, shall be placed underground for all new developments with total floor areas exceeding 10,000 gross square feet, except when extreme conditions of underlying rock or other conditions prevent this requirement from being met or as provided in paragraph (b) below, and only as approved by the director.
(c)
Exceptions. The following exceptions shall apply to this section:
(1)
Underground utilities shall not be required for developments with total floor areas of 10,000 gross square feet or less.
(2)
Transmission and main lines shall not be required to be placed underground.
(3)
Accessory mechanical systems and features such as electric distribution, transformers, switchgear, meter pedestals, telephone pedestals, terminals and other similar equipment, which is normally installed above ground in accordance with accepted utility practices for underground distribution systems may be installed.
(4)
Meters, service connections, and similar equipment normally attached to the outside wall of the premises it serves may be installed.
(5)
Overhead utility services for existing developments in place as of the effective date of this section may be repaired, replaced or increased in capacity.
(6)
Temporary overhead facilities required for construction purposes will be permitted.
(d)
Utility conversion fund. A city fund, known as the "The City of Brookhaven Utility Conversion Fund" is hereby created. The purpose of said fund is to accept deposits as described in paragraph (d) below, along with other funds or grants apportioned by the mayor and city council, and the use of such funds shall be restricted for the sole purpose of offsetting the cost of projects undertaken by the city to bury or relocate power lines from streets and sidewalks.
(e)
Fee-in-lieu. In cases where the expense to bury overhead utilities for new developments described in paragraph (a), above, is deemed to be unreasonably costly due to the complexity of the work, the developer may request approval from the director of a fee-in-lieu arrangement, whereby the developer shall make a contribution toward the City's Utility Conversion Fund in lieu of requiring burial of the utilities. Such fee-in-lieu arrangement shall be based on a cost per linear foot of such underground relocation of utilities established by the mayor and city council, as may be adjusted from time to time by city ordinance.
(f)
Accessory mechanical systems and features. Accessory mechanical systems, including utility meters, boxes, HVAC units, and other similar equipment shall not be located between the building and a public or private right-of-way. Efforts shall be taken to locate accessory mechanical system features including utility meters, boxes and other similar equipment so as to not be visible from the public or private right-of-way. When this is not possible or satisfied, as determined by the director, the following screening shall be required:
(1)
Roof-mounted systems. Roof-mounted systems shall be screened with an opaque wall constructed of materials similar to the primary building.
(2)
All other systems. Systems mounted on walls, ground, or elsewhere, shall be screened with an opaque wall constructed of materials similar to the primary building or sufficient landscaping to provide year-round screening.
(g)
Waiver of utility provisions.
(1)
The director may waive one or more of the requirements of this article, provided that the director makes the following findings with respect to the utility service to which the waiver pertains:
a.
That the property owner seeking the waiver has submitted justification of the waiver in writing;
b.
That two or more of the following criteria are met:
1.
The city arborist has determined that the new or expanded utility service, if placed underground, would endanger an existing specimen tree by damaging its root system;
2.
The new or expanded utility service, if placed overhead, would not be visible from a public or private street or any other public or private right-of-way;
3.
The new or expanded overhead utility service, if placed underground, would significantly interfere with one or more existing city or private underground utilities;
4.
If the waiver is granted, there would be a reduction in the total number of overhead utility service lines serving the owner's property;
5.
If the waiver is granted, the length of the overhead utility service to the owner's property would be less than the length of the service in existence at the time the application is made;
6.
The new, extended or relocated service or facility is required to provide additional street lighting to suppress criminal activity and that the waiver is requested or supported by the chief of police; and
7.
The new, extended or relocated service or facility would require boring under a state route and is restricted by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(2)
Any property owner whose application for a waiver under this section has been denied by the director may appeal the director's decision to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days of the director's denial. City council shall conduct a public hearing on any such appeal. In deciding the appeal, council shall determine whether good cause exists to grant the requested waiver; provided, that, in making this determination, council shall, in conjunction with an appeal involving a utility service, consider the decision factors set out above.
