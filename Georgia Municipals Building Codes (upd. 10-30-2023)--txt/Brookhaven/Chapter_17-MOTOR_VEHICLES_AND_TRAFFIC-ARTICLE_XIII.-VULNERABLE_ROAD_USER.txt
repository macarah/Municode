When there is insufficient room to the left of the vulnerable road user in the lane of traffic moving in the direction of travel to comply with (a)(3)a. of this subsection, traffic may move into the opposite-direction traffic lane when it is safe to do so in order to provide the three foot passing distance. When it becomes necessary to cross to the left side of the center line in order to maintain a safe distance for passing a vulnerable road user, it is the responsibility of the motor vehicle operator to ensure it is safe to do so, and to remain compliant with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-45.

(2)
Any person lawfully riding a bicycle, skateboard, scooter, or roller or in-line skates or similar device always yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians, persons in wheel chairs, or an electric mobility assistive vehicle and shall give an audible signal before overtaking and passing the pedestrian, person in wheel chair, or in an electric mobility assistive vehicle.
(3)
Any person riding a bicycle or similar device during nighttime shall comply with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-294(a) regarding the use of a white light in the front of the bicycle and a rear-facing red reflector, with or without the addition of a rear facing red light.

(1)
At the time of the offense, the vulnerable road user was acting in violation of any applicable traffic law, including any requirements of this article, if the vulnerable road user's violation of such traffic law or ordinance was the sole proximate cause of the violation of this article.
(2)
At the time of the offense, the pedestrian was in violation of any of the duties, as defined below
a.
