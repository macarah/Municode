(Ord. No. O2013-01-60, § 23-93, 1-22-2013)
Sec. 23-162. - Funding.
(a)
Assessment. Each owner of property abutting the sidewalks shall be assessed a share of the cost to be funded by the district, which cost shall be added to the ad valorem property taxes for each owner as provided in this section. No assessment shall be made against abutting property, unless the same is consented to in writing by the owners of 51 percent of the property abutting such improvements. Abutting shall mean adjacent to, contiguous with, or adjoining.
(b)
Pro rata costs. Each property owner's share of the cost shall be determined as follows: The total cost of the project shall be calculated by the city, and the figure so derived shall be known as the total project cost. The city shall next determine the linear feet of sidewalk that was constructed. The total cost shall then be divided by the total linear feet of sidewalk to derive the cost per foot. Each property owner abutting the sidewalks shall then be assessed an amount that equals the linear feet of street frontage the property owner has multiplied by the cost per foot.
(c)
Payment. The sidewalk tax assessment shall be paid by one of two options, as follows:
(1)
Option 1. The assessment may be paid in cash by the property owner within 90 days of the mailing of the assessment by the city. If paid under this option, the assessment will not bear an administrative fee and no lien shall be recorded against the property. Payment shall be made to city and delivered to the public works department. If payment is not made in full within 90 days of the city's initial billing of the assessment, then payment option two shall automatically take effect. Once option two is in effect, the payment via option two shall be the property owner's sole option until all assessment payments are satisfied.
(2)
Option 2. The assessment shall be paid in five equal annual installments. Payment of each such assessment shall be due and payable within 60 days from the mailing by regular mail of a bill from the tax commissioner. In the event option two is selected, the cost of processing, administration, recording the lien, and satisfaction of such lien shall be added to the assessment.
(d)
Notification to purchaser. The property owner shall advise any purchaser of its property within the sidewalk district of the assessment. The property owner may conduct a proration of the assessment with the purchaser. The city shall not be responsible for the proration of the assessments between sellers and purchasers nor shall the city be under any duty to notify any purchaser of the existence or liability for the assessment.
(e)
Collection when not paid. If the assessment is not paid when due, the assessment shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to the same interest and penalties.
(f)
Lien. The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the tax commissioner in the lien records of the clerk of the county superior court.
(g)
Processing fee. The fee for processing and administration of this option shall be established by the public works department and approved by the city council.

(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-167. - Permitted use; application and fees.
(a)
Permit applications must contain a demonstration that proposed facilities meet the following objective design guidelines:
(1)
Intent and purpose. Small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way and utility poles installed or repurposed in the public rights-of-way for deployment of small cell facilities shall be designed in such a manner to maximize compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and to minimize any negative visual impact on the surrounding neighborhood. The objective design standards contained in this code section regulating the location context, color, stealth design, and concealment of the proposed small wireless facility shall apply, unless a waiver of the objective design standards contained herein is approved by the mayor and city council.
(2)
Permittees shall not place or maintain signage on communications facilities, including small cell facilities or utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities, in public rights-of-way, unless otherwise required by federal or state law, provided; however, existing structures that lawfully supported signage before being repurposed may continue to support signage as otherwise permitted by law.
(3)
A small wireless facility shall not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by applicable codes, local codes or regulations, a permit issued by the city, or state and federal laws and regulations or as permitted by the city.
(4)
Design and stealth design standards for new utility poles or replaced utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities. All proposed new or replaced utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities shall meet the design standards contained in this code section, or the license agreement and permit, unless waived by the mayor and city council.
a.
A replaced or restructured utility pole to accommodate the deployment of a small wireless facility shall be in the same location as the original utility pole.
b.
The replaced or restructured utility pole shall be substantially similar in finish, base and pole design, diameter, material and height as the original pole being replaced, unless the city requires a different design, color or composition to be consistent with applicable city standards for new utility poles.
c.
The height for a new pole, modified pole or replacement pole installed in a historic district and in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed 50 feet above ground level; each new, modified or replacement pole installed in the right-of-way not in a historic district or area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed the greater of (i) 50 feet above ground level; or (ii) ten feet greater in height above ground level than the tallest existing pole in the same city right-of-way in place as of January 1, 2019 and located within 500 feet of the new proposed pole.
d.
New utility poles shall be designed to be substantially similar in design to other utility poles in the same block or vicinity of the public rights-of-way. Such design aspects to follow include the material, base, pole diameter and style, location and style of attachments, finish, and cap, as applicable. By way of example, if existing utility poles in the same area of the public rights-of-way are light poles, the new utility pole should be designed substantially similar to such light poles and to the extent consistent with location context regulations, equidistant between existing poles. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any such stealth utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility shall function in the same manner as the facility it is intended to resemble in compliance with the city Code, at the expense of the permittee. By way of example, if a permittee installs a utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility to resemble a nearby light pole, the facility should include a light that is operated in the same manner as other light poles, at the applicant's expense unless and until ownership of such pole is transferred to the city.
e.
Notwithstanding this subsection, if the proposed location of a new utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility is within a public right-of-way that is within a particular special district, zoning district, community development district, community redevelopment agency, character area, overlay district, historic district or property, or a homeowners' association that has design standards applicable to utility poles, such proposed utility pole shall substantially comply with such design standards.
(5)
This subsection does not authorize the installation of a new utility pole for deployment of a small wireless facility in a location that is otherwise prohibited pursuant to court order or applicable codes.
(6)
Attachment authorization. Any small cell facilities that require installing, collocating, modifying or replacing wireless attachments and ancillary equipment to a pole or support structure, or otherwise attaching or using a third party's pole shall require, in addition to obtaining a permit, the applicant to submit evidence that the applicant has authorization allowing the placement of the small wireless facility on the pole or other support structure.
(7)
Small wireless facilities and wireless attachments shall be operated and maintained in a manner that does not interfere with public safety, utility or public works equipment.
(b)
Stealth design for deployment of small cell facilities.
(1)
Wires, cables and equipment to be deployed on a utility pole shall be within the utility pole or if not possible to being installed within the utility pole, covered with a shroud. No exposed wires or cables are permitted.
(2)
If the utility pole for the proposed deployment of a small wireless facility is a light pole, a street light fixture substantially similar in design to the existing street light fixture shall, to the extent technically feasible, be used to camouflage the small wireless facility such as through replacement of the cobra head with a new cobra head containing the small wireless facility, or a side-mounted light may be replaced with a substantially similarly designed side mounted light containing the small wireless facility. Unless consistent with the design of the utility pole, a small wireless facility shall not be deployed on a mast of a utility pole. Any street light fixture installed by the permittee shall be maintained in good working order by the permittee at its cost unless and until ownership of such pole is transferred to the city.
(3)
Maximum height restrictions. A small wireless facility, including any attached antennas, shall not exceed ten feet above the existing structure, repurposed structure or utility pole upon which the small wireless facility is to be deployed or 50 feet whichever is higher.
(c)
Wireless equipment not deployed on utility poles or existing structures.
(1)
Ground-mounted wireless facilities up to 28 cubic feet in dimension shall be located within a ten foot radius of the existing structure or utility pole for the collocated small wireless facility.
(2)
The ground-mounted wireless facilities shall be architecturally designed consistent with the city's design style. Ground-mounted small cell facilities up to 28 cubic feet shall have a non-reflective finish of a neutral color consistent with the predominant background color of the attachment or the surrounding landscape and placed on a concrete base surrounded by appropriate landscaping for the area. Alternatively, the permittee may propose a small wireless facility that would be substantially similar in terms of material, design and color finish to other at-grade city-owned infrastructure within 500 feet of the proposed location in the public rights-of-way such as waste receptacles or city rights-of-way infrastructure.
(3)
To the extent consistent with applicable codes, at the city's direction the permittee owner of a ground-mounted small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way shall conceal the facility with landscaping and plantings consistent with other landscaping in the area. In areas with landscaped swales, the small wireless facility must be within the swale and concealed with consistent landscaping. Landscaping and plantings pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the city's approval and be maintained by the permittee at its sole cost and expense consistent with the city Code for so long as the small wireless facility remains in the public rights-of-way.
(d)
Routine maintenance and replacement. An application shall not be required for: (i) routine maintenance; and (ii) the replacement of a small small wireless facility with another small small wireless facility that is substantially similar or smaller in size, weight, and height.
(e)
Information updates. Any amendment to information contained in a permit application shall be submitted in writing to the city no more than 30 days after the change necessitating the amendment. Should an application require updating pursuant to this section, any applicable shot clock shall be deemed tolled the number of days between the change necessitating the amendment, and notice under this subsection being transmitted to the city.
(f)
[Fees]. Application fees due under this chapter shall be payable upon submission of the application, and any failure to fully pay application fees at the time of application submission shall absolve the city from any requirement to process the application until those fees are paid, to the extent permissible by law.

Ten feet above the existing utility pole or wireless support structure upon which the small cell small wireless facility is to be installed; or,
b.
Fifty feet in height.
(2)
Each new utility pole or wireless support structure in the rights-of-way shall not exceed 50 feet in height.
(3)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this section shall not be interpreted to permit aggregation of multiple height increases, such as by seeking to install a new utility pole or wireless support structure, and then attempting to exceed what would have been the maximum permissible height for that new or replacement pole by requesting an increase to attach facilities. Height limits for existing utility poles or wireless support structures shall be assessed based on the height of the structure before the first small wireless facility is installed, and applicants shall not be permitted to request additional height increases based on the total height of a pole, including existing wireless facilities above the top of the utility pole or wireless support structure.
(b)
Undergrounding provisions. Applicant shall comply with nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements that prohibit electric utilities, telecommunications or cable providers from installing structures in the rights-of-way without prior zoning approval in areas zoned for single family residential use, provided such requirements shall not prohibit the replacement of existing structures with structures whose design the city expressly consents to.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-171. - Effect of permit.
(a)
Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the rights-of-way.
(b)
Duration. No permit for construction issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months unless construction has actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-172. - Removal, relocation or modification of small wireless facilities in the ROW.
(a)
Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the city, unless a longer period is provided for at the sole discretion of the city, a wireless provider shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any small wireless facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the city has determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the rights-of-way. To the extent feasible, the city will reasonably cooperate with a wireless provider whose facilities must be removed or relocated to attempt to locate a mutually acceptable replacement location to house the small wireless facilities. This provision shall not be interpreted to constitute a commitment on the part of the city that such a location will be found or provided, or that the city is under an obligation to ensure such alternative locations are available.
(b)
Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any small small wireless facility located within the rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall notify the wireless provider and provide the wireless provider an opportunity to move its own facilities prior to cutting or removing a facility and in any event shall notify the wireless provider as soon as is practicable but in no event more than 15 days after cutting or removing a small small wireless facility.
(c)
Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a small small wireless facility within the rights-of-way of the city, the wireless provider shall notify the city within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the small small wireless facility if the city, or any of its departments, determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
(d)
Removal and restoration. Any small small wireless facility removed from the rights-of-way shall be removed in accordance with all applicable health and safety requirements. The site upon which the facility was located shall be restored to the condition that existed prior to the installation of the facility, normal wear and tear excepted, or as required by the city planner. The holder of the original permit for the facility shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and paying all costs associated with the removal of the facility and site restoration.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-173. - Rates for access to rights-of-way.
(a)
Legislative findings. The city council makes the following additional findings:
(1)
The right-of-way owned and maintained by the city is a limited and valuable resource and asset of the citizens and residents of the City;
(2)
Small cell wireless providers use hard-wired connections between the receiver at the small cell small wireless facility and a distribution point for the larger wireless network;
(3)
Georgia law authorizes municipalities to utilize the Georgia Department of Transportation tables and regulations for the cost per mile of use of right-of-way;
(4)
Georgia law authorizes the city to obtain fair market value for the use of the city's right-of-way;
(5)
The city finds that the fair market value of the use of right-of-way is $1,000.00 per node or small cell small wireless facility; and
(6)
The city's actual costs for the use of the right-of-way, including limiting other and further use of the right-of-way, redevelopment costs, expansion of transportation needs (including sidewalks, multi-use paths, and other infrastructure) is $800.00 per node or small cell small wireless facility.
(b)
Annual rate for existing, replacement or modified locations. As a condition to the continued authority to maintain a small wireless facility in a right-of-way, the applicant shall pay the following fees and rates:
(1)
One hundred dollars per year for each small wireless facility deployed on any existing or replacement pole, including an existing or replacement City pole; or
(2)
Two hundred dollars per year for each new pole, other than a replacement pole, with an associated small wireless facility.
(c)
The monetary rates provided in subsections (a) through (b) of this code section shall increase two and one-half percent annually beginning January 1, 2021.
(d)
If, in a final adjudication not subject to further appeal or to review by the United States Supreme Court, a federal court reviewing Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment, et al., Declaratory Ruling and Third Report and Order, WT Docket No. 17-79 and WC Docket No. 17-84, FCC 18-133 (released September 27, 2018), or a related FCC order, or a Georgia Federal District Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, or the United States Supreme Court interpreting 47 U.S.C. Section 253(c) as it existed on January 1, 2019, determines that fair and reasonable compensation includes not only cost based charges but also market based charges with respect to application fees or right-of-way occupancy rates for the installation of small wireless facilities or poles, or to City pole attachment rates for small wireless facilities, then:
(1)
Beginning on July 1 of the calendar year following the date that the final adjudication is no longer subject to further appeal or to review by the United States Supreme Court, the monetary caps provided in subsections (b)(1)a. through (b)(1)e. of this code section for the fees or rates to which the determination applies, excluding any increases that have been made under subsection (b)(2) of this code section, shall double; and
(2)
Beginning on July 1 of the second calendar year following the date that the final adjudication is no longer subject to further appeal or to review by the United States Supreme Court, the fees established in this code section for the fees or rates to which the determination applies shall terminate. In place of any monetary caps that terminate pursuant to this subsection, applicants shall pay fees or rates, as each may be applicable, that constitute the fair and reasonable compensation due to the authority under applicable law.
(e)
Cease payment. A wireless provider is authorized to remove its facilities at any time from a pole in the rights-of-way and cease paying the annual rate to the city. A provider who exercises their rights under this section shall be entitled to return of fees paid in advance under this chapter, only for those full calendar months after the date at which the wireless provider's facilities had been removed fully and all repair and restoration work had been completed as required by law.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-174. - Attachment to city-owned utility poles in the ROW.
(a)
Annual rate. The rate to place a small small wireless facility on a city-owned pole in the right-of-way shall be $40.00 per year per city-owned pole in the rights-of-way.
(b)
Cease payment. A wireless provider is authorized to remove its facilities at any time from a city-owned pole in the rights-of-way and cease paying the annual rate to the city. A provider who exercises their rights under this section shall be entitled to return of fees paid in advance under this chapter, only for those full calendar months after the date at which the wireless provider's facilities had been removed fully and all repair and restoration work had been completed as required by law.
(c)
Make-ready. For city-owned utility poles in the rights-of-way, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested small small wireless facility, including pole replacement if necessary, within 60 days after receipt of a completed request.

All make-ready work required for a wireless provider to occupy a city-owned pole shall be conducted solely at the wireless provider's expense.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-175. - Development standards.
In addition to the requirements detailed elsewhere in this chapter, the following development standards shall apply to all small wireless facilities governed by this chapter:
(1)
Any small small wireless facility attached to a pole hosting a street light, traffic light, or other public safety purpose shall only be permissible to the extent it does not interfere with the operation of any public safety function or public safety communications. If in the City's sole discretion it is determined that a particular pole or location cannot support a small small wireless facility without interfering with or otherwise affecting the reliability, performance, safety, or other functional aspects of such a pole, the city may deny a permit to install a small wireless facility on such a pole, or to construct a new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure, at such a location, to the extent permissible under law.
(2)
All small wireless facilities shall incorporate concealment elements to the maximum extent technically and economically feasible and as appropriate to the site and type of facility. Specifically, all small wireless facilities shall employ and maintain camouflage design techniques to minimize visual impacts and provide appropriate screening. Such techniques shall be employed so that the installation, operation, and appearance of the small wireless facilities will be consistent with the character of the surrounding area or the structure to which the small small wireless facility is attached.
(3)
Wireless providers may place new poles or wireless support structures in the rights-of-way, but only where there are existing above-ground utility poles and the poles must be removed if other such poles are removed, unless those poles would meet the requirements of this subsection as permissible new poles. Specifically and furthermore, a new pole is only permitted if the applicant can show that:
a.
Existing utility poles or other support structures cannot be used to support the small wireless facilities, or would require a modification that would make the addition of an additional utility pole or wireless support structure less intrusive or safer;
b.
The pole or support structure to be installed will be similar in size and design to existing poles, and placed appropriately to minimize intrusiveness and to avoid creating undue hazard to persons or property; and
c.
The applicant demonstrates that the denial of the application would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7) as interpreted by precedent binding in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
(d)
Monopoles. Every new utility pole or wireless support structure shall be a monopole rather than a lattice tower or guy-wire support tower, unless otherwise authorized.
(e)
Access. No facility shall be built so as to cause the right-of-way in which the facility is located to fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or otherwise obstruct access.
(f)
Security. All facilities shall be designed so as to be resistant to and minimize the opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions, which would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight, or attractive nuisances.
(g)
Screening. Any equipment that is not installed underground shall be screened by structures, topography, or vegetation to the maximum extent technically and economically feasible. Coaxial cables, conduit lines, and electrical boxes for ground-mounted wireless equipment shall be placed underground or within approved structures to the extent feasible.
(h)
Public art, flagpoles, artificial natural features. Wireless providers shall be encouraged to design small wireless facilities to serve as public art, flagpoles, or artificial natural features such as trees or rocks where such designs are appropriate and technically and economically feasible.
(i)
Colors and materials. Unless otherwise required by city, county, state, or federal rules or regulations, small wireless facilities shall have a non-reflective finish and shall be a neutral color consistent with the predominant background color.
(j)
Lighting. Signal lights or illumination shall be prohibited unless required by the FCC or the Federal Aviation Administration.
(k)
Signage. The facilities shall not bear any signage, other than certification, warning, information, safety, and directional signage, or other non-commercial signage required by law, or expressly permitted by the city.
(l)
Power supply. Any facility occupying a city-owned pole is only permissible to the extent the existing function of the pole is not impeded. In particular, street lights and traffic lights' power supplies may not be used by applicants. When attaching to city-owned poles, applicants are responsible for securing separately metered power for their facilities, and are responsible for any and all costs incurred in modifying a pole to support additional power supplies. In all other cases, applicants are responsible for ensuring that their power supply arrangements with electric utilities do not result in any incremental cost increase to the city.
(m)
In the event a replacement pole is required, the applicant shall notify the pole owner: (1) of the date of city's action approving the replacement pole and (2) that, pursuant to this section 23-175(m), the city requires the pole owner to remove the old pole within 90 days of the installation of the replacement pole.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-176. - Waivers.
A request for a waiver of the design standards for a proposed small wireless facility that does not satisfy these design guidelines shall be submitted to the public works department for review and approval prior to the permittee submitting an application. The city manager or designee reserves the right to submit any application for a small wireless facility permit to the city council with notice to the applicant, to determine if such proposed facility is consistent with the city's objective design standards. The city shall approve or deny the request for a waiver in writing within 30 calendar days. If a decision is not received by the applicant on Day 30, the proposed design is deemed approved. After 30 calendar days, the applicant shall submit its application, which the city shall process in accordance with the timelines established by O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 66C.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-177. - Variance and appeal process.
(a)
Any applicant desiring relief or exemption from any aspect or requirement of this article may request the community development department, in the case of volume of the deployment, or the public works department, in any other case, provided that the relief or exemption is contained in the original application, or in the case of an existing or previously approved application a request for alteration of its proposed facilities. In determining the variance requested, the department head shall consider the elements established in subsection (b) below. In the event applicant submits an application for a variance, or any appeal of a departmental decision, applicant shall agree to toll the shot clock or application processing deadlines found in federal, state, or local law for a reasonable amount of time for the city to act upon any such request..
(b)
In the event the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the department head, the applicant may take an appeal to the city council, if such appeal is filed with the city clerk within 15 days of the final decision by the department head, which filing shall include all grounds to be asserted for the appeal. Such relief may be temporary or permanent, partial or complete, at the sole discretion of the city council. In exercising its discretion, the council may consider the following factors: (1) the number of small cell wireless facilities on the same street, (2) the number of small cell wireless facilities within 100 feet of the proposed node, (3) the volume of the other small cell wireless facilities on the same street, (4) the character area of the street on which the new deployment is proposed, (5) the proposed (if any) camouflage efforts to conceal or blend the facility into the surrounding flora and landscape, (6) the need of the node or small cell wireless facilities in the precise location proposed, and (7) the proposed deployment does not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and residents of the city. However, the burden of proving the need for the requested relief or exemption is solely on the applicant to prove to the satisfaction of the council by clear and convincing evidence. The applicant shall bear all costs of the city council in considering the request and the relief shall not be transferable to a new or different holder of the permit or owner of the facilities without the specific written permission of the council.
(Ord. No. 2019-08-01 , § 2, 7-23-2019)
Sec. 23-178. - Effective date.
This article shall take effect on August 20, 2019.
