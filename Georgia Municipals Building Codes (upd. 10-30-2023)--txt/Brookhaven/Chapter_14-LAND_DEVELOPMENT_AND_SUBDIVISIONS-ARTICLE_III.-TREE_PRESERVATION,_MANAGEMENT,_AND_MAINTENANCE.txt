III pertained to tree preservation and maintenance and derived from Ord. No. 2014-07-07, adopted Aug. 26, 2014; Ord. No. 2015-02-01, § 1, adopted Feb. 10, 2015; Ord. No. 2015-08-01, adopted Aug. 25, 2015; Ord. No. 2017-08-07 , § I, adopted Aug. 22, 2017; and Ord. No. 2019-05-07 , § I(Attch.), adopted May 28, 2019.

Sec. 14-47 - Purpose and intent.
In order to maintain and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the community, the city has established regulations governing the preservation and replacement of trees. Trees contribute to quality of life by producing oxygen, sequestering carbon, filtering pollutants from the air, cooling the environment through transpiration and the casting of shade, reducing stormwater runoff, filtering storm water and ground water, holding and building soil, reducing urban noise and glare, privacy screening, and providing habitat and food to other organisms. Trees also increase property values and are a vital component of the visual quality of the city. The city council finds that trees, and especially specimen trees (as defined in this article) are unique and not fungible. The removal or threat of removal of trees cannot ever be cured by purely legal remedies and the unique location, growth, protection, geography, and space of a tree on a lot and in a neighborhood is not capable of adequate compensation or replacement. For these reasons, trees are recognized by the city as a critical component of the city's infrastructure and shall be managed collectively as an urban forest.
These regulations are intended to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees while balancing the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property by the owner.
The city council further finds that, to support its tree canopy preservation goals, trees removed as part of any city capital improvement project will be replaced with sufficient plantings to achieve a reasonable canopy within a five-year growth period as reviewed and approved by the Tree Canopy Preservation Division of the Department of Community Development.

Due to the state survey allowance of margin of error , a survey location verification may be requested in determining the ownership status of a tree.
LDP means land disturbance permit.
Level 2 tree assessment means the tree evaluation system (pre-dating ISA TRAQ) in which a qualified professional walks completely around a tree and looks for defects in all visible areas of a tree, including the surrounding area. Diagnostic techniques may also include the use of a mallet for resonance testing, a soil probe, and binoculars. The condition of a tree is typically reported as dead, poor, fair, or good. *Although good is the highest industry tree assessment rating, this article accepts supplemental photographs and notes supporting a recommendation for any tree to be considered as a tree of quality, which would categorize the subject trees as having special qualities that make it superior to other trees assessed as good. Level 2 Tree Assessments must be conducted within the last 50 days from the date of submittal to the City for review.
Mature canopy size means the potential amount of canopy that can be expected for a tree species at maturity, categorized as small (400 square feet), medium (900 square feet) and large (1,600 square feet). Available soil volume is another factor in the size potential of a tree.

Shrub means a woody plant smaller than a tree, usually having multiple permanent stems branching from or near the ground.
Specimen tree means any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to its size, type, condition, location, or historical significance and which also meets the minimum size criteria set forth in the specimen tree table. The tree must be assessed to be in fair, good, or excellent health by a qualified professional on at least a Level 2 tree health assessment. The presence of invasive vining vegetation, lean, or co-dominance are not automatic disqualifiers for specimen tree status.
Structural root plate means the zone of rapid root taper that provides the tree stability against wind throw and soil saturation. The radius of the structural root plate is equal to one-half feet per inch of DBH. The structural root plate will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the trunk of the tree.
Tree Any living, self-supporting woody plant which normally obtains a stem diameter at breast height (4.5 feet above the ground).
Tree care prescription means a tree care plan developed by a qualified professional based on multiple variables, including scope of impact, immediate growing conditions and environment, species, size, and condition of tree. Tree care prescriptions will often include application dates in multiple seasons. Applications typically include root zone fertilization and preventative trunk sprays for wood-boring insects. They may also include root and crown pruning as needed, post-construction soil decompaction with compressed air, and the application of growth regulators into the root zone. Required tree care prescriptions are to be submitted to the city arborist for review and must provide sufficient remediation for the subject tree(s) based on the size, species, condition, and details of proposed impact(s) with the critical root zone.
Tree fund means a monetary account maintained by the finance department of the city to which monetary recompense for the removal of specimen trees is paid.
Tree of quality means a tree that merits special consideration due to ideal shape, structure, condition, species, and projected lifespan as determined by a qualified professional and the city arborist.

(Ord. No. 2021-06-03 , § I(Attch.), 6-29-2021; Ord. No. 2021-07-01 , § I(Attch.), 7-27-2021; Ord. No. 2022-10-01 , § I, 10-25-2022)
Sec. 14-51. - Minimum tree density and canopy cover requirements.
Summary. The intent and goal of these regulations is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all properties and that a significant amount of tree canopy coverage and pervious soil area is maintained throughout the city. The density requirement must be met whether or not a property or site had trees prior to development or any tree removal.
(1)
All properties within the city shall maintain or achieve a minimum tree density of 130 DBH inches per acre and a minimum canopy cover of 45 percent in perpetuity.
(2)
Minimum tree density may be achieved by and must be compliant with these guidelines:
a.
Preserving approved trees four inches or greater DBH; All trees counting toward the minimum requirements must be approved trees per section 14-50. At least 80 percent of the critical root zone and the entire structural root plate must be protected from all forms of encroachment and construction activity;
b.
Tree care prescriptions must be provided for any tree with 20 to 30 percent CRZ impact proposed or, at the discretion of the city arborist, any tree(s) where any portion of a stormwater device, a pool or spa, construction exit, or any other intensive form of impact are proposed within the CRZ; in these cases, the total CRZ percent impact may not exceed 20 percent.
c.
Preservation of tree stands. At the discretion of the city arborist, multiple trees growing together within a stand, may be required to be preserved collectively. Shared symbiotic root, soil, mycorrhizae, and microbial networks, wind-throw buffering, sunlight buffering, potential equipment impact, and the conditions of specific trees within the stand, per the Level 2 Tree Assessment, are factors considered in tree stand preservation. This code may apply where minimum site density exists.
d.
Planting approved trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this section, where tree removal or land development results in a deficit of minimum tree density or canopy cover;
e.
No property permitted for new development activity may remove all existing trees whose structural root plates are outside the buildable limits; this applies to existing approved trees;
f.
All trees must be free from invasive vining and understory vegetation. No damages to trees may be incurred during the removal of invasive vegetation. All vegetation that is listed on the Georgia Exotic Pest Plant Council (EPPC) Invasive Plant List (section 14-50) must be sufficiently controlled.
g.
No approved trees located within the city public right-of-way may be removed or destroyed by owners of abutting private property or agents acting on their behalf; For permitted land disturbance, critical root zone impact of a city right-of-way tree qualifies the tree as a boundary tree as defined in section 14-50 and section 14-55(e) whereby a signed boundary tree agreement will not be required but all other necessary means of tree protection as determined by a qualified professional may be required (section. 14-57(c));
h.
Trees within a designated pervious buffer area may qualify for density credit if the pervious buffer restoration special consideration (section 14-56, Administrative Variances) is proposed and approved by the city arborist;
i.
For private properties permitted under an LDP:
1.
Two acre site or less: A section of a tree stand as defined in section 14-50, if present on the permitting property, must be preserved as greenspace (section 14-50) to include an area at least 4,000 continuous square feet or the entire tree stand if less than 4,000 square feet and is defined by the critical root zones of the existing trees; all tree preservation measures including the removal of invasive vining vegetation and invasive understory vegetation must be executed in association with the preservation of the tree stand;
2.
More than 2 acres and less than 5.5 acre site: A section of a Tree Stand as defined in section 14-50, if present on the permitting property, must be preserved as Greenspace (section 14-50) to include an area at least 8,000 continuous square feet or the entire tree stand if less than 8,000 square feet and is defined by the critical root zones of the existing trees; all tree preservation measures including the removal of invasive vining vegetation and invasive understory vegetation must be executed in association with the preservation of the tree stand;
3.
Five and one-half (5.5) acre site or greater: At least two tree stands an area at least 8,000 square feet must be preserved as greenspace;
4.
No grading, addition of impervious surfaces, or other significant forms of land disturbance are permitted within the tree stand; however, low impact developmental features such as pervious trails, benches, and picnic tables are permissible.
5.
All replacement trees associated with LDP projects are to have a minimum caliper size of three inches.
(3)
Calculations.
a.
Minimum 130 DBH inches per acre.
1.
The calculations shall be for the net site area excluding the acreage required for buffers and infrastructure improvements (roads, sidewalks, utility lines, detention ponds, etc.). In no event shall a parking lot be considered an infrastructure improvement;
2.
According to all requirements of this section, add the DBH inches of all trees preserved or planted on the property and multiply the total DBH inches by the acreage of the site; the total must equal this calculated rate or greater. For example, a one-quarter-acre lot must have at least 32.5 (0.25 acre x 130 inches = 32.5 inches) of total DBH inches;
3.
A portion of DBH inches from approved trees located within the city public right-of-way may be counted towards the minimum density requirement so long as there is less than 20 percent CRZ impact, or root-bridging and/or arborist protection and prescription requirements are met; this allowance does not apply to boundary trees on private adjacent property;
The density credit may be calculated by multiplying the surveyed percent canopy cover over private property by the DBH of the tree;
For example, for a 26 inches tree where 25 percent of its canopy covers a private lot, the density credit calculates to be: (26 inches) (0.25) equals six and one-half inches.
4.
All information shown on the tree calculation table must align with information developed by the qualified professional for the existing tree survey and level 2 assessment;
(4)
Tree replacement.
a.
The arborist standards document will provide a complete set of guidelines and resources to meet tree replacement requirements; replacement trees must be on the approved tree list and must be installed according to the city tree planting details;
b.
The minimum dimension for pervious surface for all tree planting areas in the city is eight feet. For example, a street landscape strip or a parking lot tree island shall be a minimum of eight feet wide and eight feet long, where the replacement tree has a minimum of four feet of pervious surface area in all directions from its trunk.
c.
The minimum caliper size for tree replacements required for minimum tree density or specimen tree recompense is two caliper inches; replacement trees for LDPs are subject to a larger minimum caliper size as determined by the city arborist;
(5)
For all replacement trees:
a.
Species selected for planting shall be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site;
b.
All replacement tree selections are subject to review and changes by the city arborist;
c.
A single species or variety may comprise no more than 20 percent of the full replacement schedule;
d.
At least 60 percent of trees selected for planting must be approved overstory;
e.
Screen conifers and dwarf Southern Magnolia cultivars may not account for more than ten percent of the full replacement schedule. Pines (Pinus sp.), Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara), Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum), and Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) are exempt.
f.
A 1.5 multiplier may be credited to the caliper size for the planting of each tree for species identified on the approved replacement tree lists on the Arborist Standards Document.
(6)
Frontage plantable area (FPA) requirements. Sec. 14-50, defines the frontage plantable area as the pervious portion of the frontage which is offset at least five feet from all property lines and impervious surfaces and at least ten feet from any permanent structure. Front yard is defined as a yard extending the full width of the lot (between the side lot lines) between the principal building and the street right-of-way (Sec. 27-1383). The preservation of existing approved trees may count towards the requirements herein. All specifications for replacement trees herein refer to perpetual tree requirements within the frontage plantable area of properties within the city:
a.

  ;adv=6;(b)
Any specimen tree preserved with less than 20 percent critical root zone impact and zero impact to the structural root plate shall be eligible for a density or canopy cover credit of one and one-half times DBH inches or area.
(c)
Any specimen tree preserved with 20 to 33 percent critical root zone impact and zero impact to the structural root plate shall require an arborist prescription, approved by the city arborist; they shall be eligible for a density or canopy cover credit of one and one-half times DBH inches or area with an approved arborist prescription.
(d)
The removal of any specimen tree outside the buildable limits and side setback (Ch. 27, Article II) area will require recompense at 1.5 x DBH inches. The 1.5 multiplier will not be applied to recompense calculations for the removal of any specimen tree inside the buildable limits and side setback (Ch. 27, Article II) area. Tree replacement quantity must be maximized according to industry standards for spacing, light, and soil volume. This requirement is in addition to the minimum tree density requirements.
(e)
A tree density surplus that is achieved with tree preservation on site may be applied to any specimen tree recompense owed.
For example, if the minimum tree density required for a site is 38 DBH inches, and 50 DBH inches are preserved, the surplus of 12 DBH inches may be applied to any specimen recompense owed.
(f)
If the city arborist agrees that all the specimen recompense replacement trees will not fit on the site in accordance with accepted industry standards, the remaining inches owed shall be addressed by monetary payment of a recompense fee to the tree fund. Specimen recompense fees must be paid within 180 days from the date of notice of approval from the City and prior to issuance of the approved permit.
(g)
In a case where a specimen tree or trees are removed without or prior to the issuance of an approved permit from the City, all applicable specimen recompense fees shall be paid to the City within 180 days from the date on which the violator(s) are served a court summons/citation for the offense(s). Failure to due to will result in enforcement and penalties per Sec. 14-58.
(h)
The specimen tree recompense fee is computed as follows:
1.
Specimen trees outside the buildable limits and side setback (Ch. 27, Article II) area: Recompense fee = $240.00 per DBH inch x 1.5.
2.
Specimen trees inside the buildable limits and side setback (Ch. 27, Article II) area: Recompense fee = $120.00 per DBH inch.
3.
The number of inches subject to specimen recompense fee for a permitting lot shall not exceed 300 inches per acre.
If specimen tree recompense owed equals or exceeds the quantity of the calculated maximum, the calculated maximum shall be owed in recompense. For example, the calculated maximum for a quarter-acre lot is 0.25 acre x 300" = 75". If the actual amount of specimen tree recompense owed is 100", this amount exceeds 75", and therefore, 75" recompense is owed.
(i)
Champion trees. As defined in section 14-50, the proposed removal of a champion tree shall warrant a variance hearing with the Board of Appeals per [section] 14-56(b). The 50 percent or more buildable area exemption within this section does not apply to the proposed removal of a Champion tree. Alternative design concepts to preserve the tree must be presented to the city as part of the variance hearing. Champion trees are given the highest level of protection within the city and all site design, tree protection methods during construction, and prescriptive tree care options must be given due process and consideration.
(j)
Trees of quality. As defined in section 14-50, a tree of quality will be eligible for preservation credits equal to specimen trees: one and one-half times DBH inches or canopy cover area. The entire structural root plate and at least 80 percent of the critical root zone (CRZ) must be protected to receive the additional preservation credit; A qualified professional must submit supplemental photographs and notes supporting their recommendation for any tree to be considered as a tree of quality.

Sec. 14-55. - Protection of trees during construction.
(a)
Trees identified to be preserved and counted toward the tree density requirements shall have temporary chain link or other metal fence, a minimum of five feet in height, installed exactly where it is located on the approved tree plan. Each panel of fencing is to be tightly bound to the adjacent panels and firmly stabilized at the base. A sign shall be placed on the fencing stating "Keep Out." This area is designated as the tree protection area, an area encompassing the critical root zone of a tree that shall remain in a pervious state and undisturbed.
(b)
A two-inch layer of organic matter must be present over the critical root zone in tree protection areas. Utilizing fresh wood chips from approved tree removals on-site to provide a two-inch layer of protective organic matter is a permissible practice and is encouraged.
(c)
Any form of encroachment into the tree protection area may result in a 'Stop Work' Order from the city. The encroachment and protection must be immediately corrected. If the level of encroachment has likely caused significant impact to the tree/s, as determined by a qualified professional, additional tree protection measures, including but not limited to root pruning, decompaction, and prescriptive soil treatments may also be required before the 'Stop Work' Order is lifted. Court summons as a violation of this section will be issued for prolonged, repeat, or severe forms of encroachment significantly compromising the health of a tree or trees.
(d)
Trees identified to be preserved should be branch and root pruned according to ANSI A300 standards. This is only a requirement for trees that will likely have crown and/or root encroachment per the approved tree plan.
(e)
Tree care prescriptions developed by a qualified professional will be required for any tree on the permitting property or boundary tree with 20 percent CRZ impact or greater proposed or at the discretion of the city arborist due to the intensive nature of proposed impact, including but not limited to any portion of a stormwater device, pool or spa, or construction exit encroaching within a CRZ.
(f)
Boundary tree protection. A boundary tree is any tree located on a property with a critical root zone that extends into the soil of an adjacent property.
(1)
The permittee shall provide a Boundary Tree Agreement (BTA) to the owner of the tree if proposed critical root zone impact is 20 percent or greater, or at the discretion of the City arborist, based on the intensive nature of proposed development activity within the critical root zone. This includes but is not limited to storm water devices, pools and spas, and construction exits.
The boundary tree agreement must specify:
a.
The exact tree or trees.
b.
Proposed CRZ percent impact.
c.
Protection of the entire Structural Root Plate.
d.
Assumption of full liability for the protection of the tree. If the tree is proposed to have a CRZ impact of 20 percent or greater, a tree care prescription by a qualified professional must be offered to the owner of the trees.
e.
Pursuant to (d) in this section, section 14-48(h), and Sec. 14-50 (tree pruning definition), specify that any necessary crown pruning for building height clearance will be conducted according to ANSI A300 standards. This includes never removing more than 25 percent of the live branches, never cutting a branch below the branch collar, never using spikes to ascend a tree (causing injury to the bark and vascular tissue), and avoidance of pruning scaffold (large) limbs all the way back to the main trunk of the tree wherever possible. If the permittee intends to conduct any level of pruning on a boundary tree, adherence to these guidelines shall be explicitly communicated in the boundary tree agreement.
f.
Assumption of future removal and replacement costs if the tree fails or has begun to decline in health, as determined by a qualified professional.
g.
The BTA is not to be written in such a way that it is an entitlement to destroy the tree.
h.
Permittee full name, phone number, email address, physical address, and signature.
i.
Boundary tree/s owner full name, phone number, email address, physical address, and signature.
(2)
The owner of a boundary tree may request that a tree protection escrow account be established prior to the issuance of any permit proposing impact of 20 percent or greater. The escrow account requested cannot exceed the appraised value of the tree by a qualified professional and cannot be less than the market cost for the removal and replacement of the tree.
(3)
If the permittee cannot reasonably obtain a signature for the boundary tree agreement, the permittee may provide to the City a copy of the BTA and a letter of receipt of the BTA by Certified Mail.
(4)
Permittees associated with land disturbance activity shall not be permitted to remove or destroy trees that are not located on the permitting property; this includes applying for a tree removal permit on behalf of an adjacent property owner.
(g)
Final landscaping and stabilization.
(1)
Per section 14-48(k), no grading or disturbance within the designated tree protection area is permitted. This includes the time during which the city land development inspector allows for all erosion control measures and tree protection fencing to be removed from the site for final landscaping and stabilization.
(2)
The only activity associated with land development that is permitted within the tree protection area is:
a.
All activity associated with the control and removal of invasive vegetation;
b.
The application of mulch, which is not to exceed a depth of four inches.
Per section 14-50, Mulch is an organic material spread around the base of a plant or on a plant bed to enrich and insulate the soil. Mulch should never make contact with a tree above the root collar.
Acceptable types of mulch include Pine Straw, Shredded Hardwood, Wood Chips, Bark Chips, or Leaf Litter. Synthetic or artificial mulches and artificially dyed mulches are not permitted for new mulch applications to preserved and replaced trees.
(h)
Survivorship of preserved and planted trees.
(1)
For all permitted projects involving land disturbance, all trees shown to be preserved or planted on the site plan approved by the city must remain alive and healthy. Any subject tree that dies or exhibits signs of decline or failure within five years of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or passing of the site final inspection must be removed and replaced by the permittee.

Sec. 14-56. - Variances.
(a)
Administrative variances.
(1)
A permittee may request an administrative variance for a reduction of setback distance to be reviewed by the director. These variance requests may be considered if the variance would reduce potential impact to a tree where it may be given a reasonable chance of survival. Front, side, and rear yard setbacks, and parking requirements may be reduced up to 25 percent by the city arborist and the director in order to preserve existing specimen trees. Appropriate conditions to said administrative variances shall be imposed so as to ensure the continued health of said trees following the granting of such variances, including mandatory replacement requirements. Administrative variances shall be considered and decided consistent with procedures and criteria as set forth within the zoning ordinance.
(2)
Vegetated Stormwater Control Measure (SCM) which includes trees may count toward the tree density requirement; SCM must be reviewed and approved by city stormwater engineer;
(3)

For trees or tree stands within a city stream or other pervious buffer with a significant presence of invasive vegetation, density credit may be applied to all approved trees within the area where all invasive vegetation is sufficiently controlled. The area of control must be the entire CRZ of all trees plus ten feet in all directions where applicable. If there is an insignificant presence of native understory vegetation, the understory must be replanted with an approved plant list of native trees and shrubs after control of invasive vegetation is verified by the city. The understory plant material does not have to meet the tree replacement caliper minimum of two inches (2.0"). Pervious buffer restoration plans will be assessed by the city arborist on a case by case basis. Information on existing invasive and native understory vegetation must be provided by a qualified professional and be considered in the restoration plan; all approved work must be executed under the supervision of a qualified professional.
a.
No mechanical or chemical damages or soil compaction may be incurred to approved trees as part of measures taken to control the invasive vegetation;
b.
All native understory vegetation must be reasonably preserved; all topsoil and leaf litter must be reasonably preserved;
c.
Herbicide application to woody invasive plant species must be targeted on fresh-cut stumps or suckering stems from stumps; broadcast herbicide application to woody invasive plants is not permitted;
d.
In no case will this special consideration eliminate the frontage plantable area requirements (Section 14-51(f)).
(4)
Tree stand restoration. For trees or tree stands on private property in non-buffer areas with a significant presence of invasive vegetation, all native woody species 0.5 caliper inches or greater may count towards density credit. All invasive vegetation must be sufficiently controlled. The area of control must be the entire CRZ of all trees plus ten feet in all directions where applicable. If there is an insignificant presence of native understory vegetation, the understory must be replanted with an approved plant list of native trees and shrubs after control of invasive vegetation is verified by the city. The understory plant material does not have to meet the tree replacement caliper minimum of two inches (2.0"). Tree stand restoration plans will be assessed by the city arborist on a case by case basis. Information on existing invasive and native understory vegetation must be provided by a qualified professional and be considered in the restoration plan; all approved work must be executed under the supervision of a qualified professional.
a.
No mechanical or chemical damages or soil compaction may be incurred to approved trees as part of measures taken to control the invasive vegetation;
b.
All native understory vegetation must be reasonably preserved; all topsoil and leaf litter must be reasonably preserved;
c.
Herbicide application to woody invasive plant species must be targeted on fresh-cut stumps or suckering stems from stumps; broadcast herbicide application to woody invasive plants is not permitted;
d.
In no case will this special consideration eliminate the frontage plantable area requirements (Section 14-51(f)).
(b)
Variances. The board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for variances for the removal of a specimen tree that is located outside of the buildable area and side setback area. Where the cumulative critical root zone of existing specimen trees covers more than 50 percent of the buildable area of a lot, a variance shall not be required. The provisions of Chapter 27, Article X, Division 6 shall apply with regard to this section. No such special exception for the removal of a specimen tree shall be granted by the board of appeals unless the applicant has demonstrated, and the board of appeals has found, that the property has no economic value absent the grant of the special exception. In making this determination, the board of appeals shall consider the following factors:
(1)
Value of the trees in question, considering their age, size, health, and significance.
(2)
The current level of expected economic return on the property.
(3)
The marketability of the property.
(4)
