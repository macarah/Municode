Removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater;
(3)
Reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation;
(4)
Protecting and stabilizing stream channels and banks;
(5)
Providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff;
(6)
Maintaining base flow of streams;
(7)
Contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem;
(8)
Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat;
(9)
Providing riparian wildlife habitat;
(10)
Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and
(11)
Providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of green space.
(b)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create buffer zones and impervious setbacks along the streams of the city for the protection of water resources; and

Sec. 14-149. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer means the area defined in section 14-153(a)(1).
Ephemeral stream means a stream that, under normal circumstances, has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which temporary runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding, which would have at least a one percent probability of flooding occurrence in any calendar year based on the basin being fully developed as shown on the current land use plan (i.e., the regulatory flood).
Impervious cover means those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to land development. Impervious cover includes, but is not limited to, rooftops, buildings, parking lots, driveways, streets, roads, decks (other than elevated slatted decks), swimming pools, patio areas, paved storage areas, compacted gravel areas, artificial turf, awnings and any concrete or asphalt areas.
Impervious setback means the setback area defined in section 14-153(a)(2).
Land development means any land change, including, but not limited to, clearing, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land in connection with the construction, paving and any installation of impervious cover.
Land development activity means those actions or activities which comprise, facilitate or result in land development.
Land disturbance means any land or vegetation change, including, but not limited to, clearing, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, that do not involve construction, paving or any other installation of impervious cover.
Land disturbance activity means those actions or activities which comprise, facilitate or result in land disturbance.
Parcel means any plot, lot, parcel, tract or acreage shown as a unit on either the latest county tax assessment records or other area of land legally established by plat or subdivision.

Setback means, with respect to a stream, the area established by section 14-153(a)(2) extending beyond any buffer applicable to the stream.
State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state, which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon a parcel. Ephemeral streams are not considered state waters for the purpose of this article.
Stream means any natural, running water flowing continuously or intermittently in a channel on or below the surface of the ground, except that an ephemeral stream is not a stream.
Stream channel means the confining cut of ground surface that contains the base flow of a stream and is identified at a point where the water flow has wrested the vegetation.
Unusual circumstances means:
(1)
The shape, topography or other physical conditions of the parcel prevents land development in a manner consistent with similar situated properties within the proximity of the parcel;
(2)
Circumstances constituting force majeure; or

(Ord. No. 2014-01-05, att.(14-44.6), 3-25-2014)
Sec. 14-153. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development and land disturbance activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both sides of the stream channel as measured from the point of wrested vegetation.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. All permitted land disturbance activity shall be minimized within the setback. In allowing for such activity, the provision for retaining walls or other topographical enhancements to limit of the area of land disturbance activity within the setback, may be required and approved by the community development director as part of the administrative variance procedure in subsection (a)(2) of this section, subject to the approval of the city engineer.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedure; application. A variance from the prohibition of land development within the above buffer or setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
If, due to unusual circumstances, the strict adherence to the minimal buffer or setback requirements in this article would adversely affect the parcel owner, in a material manner, upon application by the parcel owner the city council or the board of appeals of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder after the conduct of a public hearing and such variance includes conditions requiring mitigation measures to offset the effects of the proposed land development on the parcel; provided, however, a variance will not be considered when, following the adoption of this article, actions of any owner of a given parcel have created conditions of an unusual circumstance on that parcel. A variance granted for a land development activity shall only include the area within in the buffer or impervious setback necessary to alleviate the effect of an unusual circumstance. At a minimum, the mitigation for encroachment into the buffer or setback shall include:
a.
The provision for stormwater management and water quality control measures pursuant to article IV of this chapter for 100 percent of the total existing and proposed impervious areas on the parcel; provided, however, in adopting such measures, the exemptions in article IV are not available for purposes of this section. The proper installation of the stormwater management and water quality measures shall be certified by a registered engineer prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final site inspection approval for the improvements contained within the parcel; and
b.
The planting of one two and one-half-inch caliper tree of a similar type on the parcel, in addition to any other trees that are required to satisfy the landscape or tree ordinances of the city, for each tree having a diameter of eight inches or greater at breast height that is removed from the buffer or setback area pursuant to an approved variance under this article. In addition, at the discretion of the community development director, the parcel owner may be required to provide additional mitigation measures, including off-site mitigation measures in the same drainage basin, if the minimum on-site mitigation measures are not considered sufficient to compensate fully for the loss of water quality protection resulting from the encroachment into the buffer or setback.
(2)
The city council as part of a concurrent variance application permitted pursuant to chapter 27 or the board of appeals of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall notify by U.S. Mail, first class postage prepaid, all property owners within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject parcel that a variance pursuant to this article is being requested including the nature of the proposed application, hearing date, time, and location at least 15 days prior to the public hearing and shall post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing date, time, and location no less than 15 days and no more than 45 days from the date of the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the parcel as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. The community development director or the city engineer shall prepare and submit to the city council or board of appeals a technical analysis on the applicant's mitigation measures, alternative designs and explanations of why an alternative plan is not possible. The community development director or designated representative shall be present at any such variance hearing and the city council or board shall consider the staff analysis when granting any variance or relief from the requirements of this article.
(c)
Variance procedures; application for an administrative variance. A variance from the prohibition of land disturbance within the above setback requirement may be granted by the community development director in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
The parcel owner shall make an application of the variance with the office of the community development director.
(2)
The city shall:
a.
Notify by U.S. Mail, first class postage prepaid, all property owners within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject parcel that a variance is being requested which notice shall include a description of the variance requested in the application and the mailing address and business telephone number of the community development director for the transmittal of comments within 15 days of the date of the notice; and
b.
On the same date of such mailing, post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the mailing address and business telephone number of the community development director for the transmittal of comments within 15 days of the date of the sign posting. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the parcel as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(3)
The community development director shall render a decision regarding the application no earlier than 15 days of the date of the parcel owner's notice required in subsection (b)(2) of this section and no later than 45 days from the date of such notice and in granting any such variance may require such conditions necessary to mitigate the effect of the land disturbance activity.
(4)
An adverse decision by the community development director is appealable to the board of appeals by application for appeal thereto no later than 30 days from the date of the adverse decision.
(5)
A variance granted for a land disturbance activity shall:
a.
Only include the area within the impervious setback necessary to alleviate the effect of an unusual circumstance; and
b.
Include mitigation measures that are at least as protective of the natural resources and environment in a manner no less than such as present as of the date of the variance request.
(d)
Required submittals for any variance request.
(1)
A buffer or setback variance request shall include the following:
a.
