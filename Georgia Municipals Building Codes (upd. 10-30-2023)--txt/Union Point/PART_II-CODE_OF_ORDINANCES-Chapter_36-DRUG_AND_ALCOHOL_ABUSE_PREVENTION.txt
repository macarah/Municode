Chapter 36 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION

Sec. 36-1. - Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention" and may be cited as such.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-2. - Purpose.
The city is dedicated to providing a healthy, safe working environment. In meeting these goals, it city policy to:
(1)
Assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive, and healthy manner;
(2)
Create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse;
(3)
Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances; and
(4)
Encourage employees to seek professional assistance when alcohol or drug dependency adversely affects performance of assigned duties.
The purpose of this chapter is to assure worker fitness for duty and to protect city employees and the public from the risks posed by the misuse of alcohol and use of prohibited drugs. This chapter is also intended to comply with all applicable federal regulations governing workplace anti-drug and alcohol programs in the transit industry. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has published 49 CFR 655, as amended, that mandates urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions and prohibits performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has also published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens. In addition, the federal government published 49 CFR Part 29, "The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988," which requires the establishment of drug-free workplace policies and the reporting of certain drug-related offenses to the FTA. This chapter incorporates those requirements for all employees, including without limitation those performing safety-sensitive functions.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-3. - Applicability.
(a)
This chapter applies to all city employees, including without limitation those who perform safety-sensitive functions. This chapter applies to off-site lunch periods or breaks when an employee is scheduled to return to work. Visitors, vendors, and contractor employees are governed by this chapter while on city premises, and will not be permitted to conduct city business if found to be in violation of this chapter.
(b)
A safety-sensitive function is any duty related to the safe operation of mass transit service including the operation of a revenue service vehicle (whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service), dispatch, maintenance of a revenue service vehicle or equipment used in revenue service, security personnel who carry firearms, and any other employees who hold a commercial driver's license.
(c)
All employees, including without limitation those who perform safety-sensitive functions, are hereafter described as covered employees.

(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-5. - Prohibited substances.
Prohibited substances addressed by this chapter include the following:
(1)
Illegally used controlled substances or drugs. The use of any illegal drug or any substance identified in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), as further defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15, is prohibited at all times, unless a legal prescription has been written for the substance. This includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and cocaine, as well as any drug not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legal prescribed drugs, and use of illegally obtained prescription drugs.
(2)
Legal Drugs. The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported by the covered employee to his/her supervisor. In addition, covered employees must obtain a written release from the attending physician releasing the person to perform their job duties any time they obtain a performance altering prescription.
A legally prescribed drug means that an individual has a prescription or other written approval from a physician for the use of a drug in the course of medical treatment. It must include the patient's name, the name of the substance, quantity to be taken, and the period of authorization. The misuse or abuse of legal drugs while on duty is prohibited.
(3)
Alcohol. The use of beverages containing alcohol or substances, including any medication, mouthwash, food, candy, or any other substance such that alcohol is present in the body, is prohibited. The concentration of alcohol is expressed in terms of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by an evidential breath testing device.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-6. - Prohibited conduct.
(a)
Manufacture, trafficking, possession, and use. Covered employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of illegal drugs on city premises, in city vehicles, in uniform or while on city business. Covered employees who violate this provision will be subject to disciplinary action under the city personnel ordinance. Law enforcement shall be notified when criminal activity is reasonably suspected.
(b)
Intoxication/under the influence. Any covered employee who is reasonably suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited substance, or not fit for duty shall be temporarily suspended pending an investigation and verification of condition. Covered employees found to be under the influence of a prohibited substance or who fail to pass a drug or alcohol test shall be immediately removed from duty and be subject to disciplinary action. A drug or alcohol test is considered positive if the individual is found to have a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR part 40.
(c)
Alcohol use and/or possession. No covered employee may report for duty or remain on duty when his/her ability to perform duties is adversely affected by alcohol or when his/her breath alcohol concentration is 0.4 or greater. No covered employee may use or possess alcohol while performing job duties, or just before or just after performing a job duty. Covered employees shall not use alcohol within four hours before reporting for duty, or during the hours they are on call. Violation of these provisions is prohibited and punishable by disciplinary action, pursuant to the city personnel policies.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-7. - Compliance with testing requirements.
(a)
All covered employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing as a condition of employment. All testing shall be performed in compliance with all applicable federal requirements. Any covered employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be immediately removed from duty. Refusal includes failure to provide a sufficient urine specimen, saliva sample, or breathe sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a verbal declaration, obstructive behavior, dilution of a specimen, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test. Any covered employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results (including dilution) will be required to undergo an observed collection. When the laboratory reports that a specimen is dilute, the MRO shall report to the DER that the specimen, in addition to being negative or positive, is dilute. The MRO shall check the "dilute" box (step 6) on copy 2 of the CCF. When the MRO reports a dilute specimen to the DER, the MRO must explain to the DER the employer's obligations and choices under 49 CFR ยง 40.197, to include the requirement for an immediate recollection if the creatinine concentration of a negative-dilute specimen was greater than or equal to two mg/dL but less than or equal to five mg/dL. Any of the above violations will be cause for immediate removal from duty, and shall also be cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel policies.
(b)
The following are also considered a refusal to test if the employee:
(1)
Fails to appear for a test within a reasonable time, determined by the employer, after being directed to do so by the employer;
(2)
Fails to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete;
(3)
Fails to provide a urine or breath specimen for any drug test required by this part or DOT agency regulations;
(4)
In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of the provision of a specimen;
(5)
Fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure;
(6)
Fails or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has directed the employee to take;
(7)
Fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" or "shy lung" procedures;
(8)
Fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuses to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, or behaves in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process);
(9)
Adulterates or substitutes test results, as verified by the MRO.
(10)
Drug tests can be performed any time a safety sensitive employee is on duty. An alcohol test can be performed when the safety sensitive employee is actually performing a safety sensitive duty, just before, or just after the performance of a safety sensitive duty.
(c)
Treatment requirements. All employees should use the available resources for treatment of alcohol misuse and drug abuse problems. The employee or their insurance provider will pay the cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services. Employees who make self-referrals (i.e., no management intervention or positive test results) will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program. Employees that test positive will be referred to the substance abuse professional designated by the city for assessment. Treatment may be required for those who test positive. The employee shall pay for any treatment obtained.
(d)
Notice of criminal drug conviction. All covered employees must notify the city system of any criminal drug conviction. The notice must be given in writing within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall be cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel policies.
(e)
Proper application of this chapter. The city is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this chapter. Therefore, all aspects of this chapter shall be enforced in an unbiased and impartial manner, and in compliance with all applicable federal regulations.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-8. - Testing procedures.
(a)
Generally.
(1)
Alcohol and drug testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment, and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS). All testing will be conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in 49 CFR part 40, as amended. The city recognizes its employees' privacy rights, and testing will be done in conformity with privacy requirements. Immediately prior to testing employees shall be told the test is required by federal regulations.
(2)
The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen. For those specimens that are positive, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR part 40, as amended.
(3)
Tests for breath alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using a NHTSA-approved evidential breath testing device (EBT) operated by a trained breath alcohol technician (BAT). A covered employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her position for 24 hours, unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater is a positive alcohol test and in violation of this chapter and the requirements set forth in 49 CFR part 655 for covered employees.
(4)
The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. Urine specimens will be collected using the split specimen collection method described in 49 CFR Part 40. Each specimen will be accompanied by a DOT chain of custody and control form and identified using a unique identification number that attributes the specimen to the correct individual. An initial drug screen will be conducted on the primary urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, appear to be substitute, or adulterated, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR part 40, as amended. Attachment C, located at the end of this chapter, lists the minimum thresholds established for each drug and/or its metabolites. The test results from the laboratory will be reported to a medical review officer. A medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with detailed knowledge of substance abuse disorders and drug testing. The MRO will review the test results to ensure the scientific validity of the test and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result, substitution or adulteration. The MRO will contact the employee, notify employee of the positive, substitute, or adulterated laboratory result, and provide employee with an opportunity to explain the confirmed test result. The MRO will then review the employee's medical history/medical records to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a positive, substitute or adulterated laboratory result. If no legitimate medical explanation is found, the test will be verified positive, substitute, or adulterated and reported to the company program manager. If a legitimate explanation is found, the MRO will report the test result as negative.
(5)
The split specimen will be stored at the initial laboratory until the analysis of the primary specimen is completed. If the primary specimen is negative, the split will be discarded. If the primary is positive, the split will be retained for testing if so requested by the employee through the medical review officer. The city reserves the right to test for additional drugs.
(b)
Observed collections.
(1)
Per 49 CFR part 40 collection under direct observation (by a person of same gender) with no advance notice will occur if:
a.
The laboratory reports to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reports to program manager (city manager) that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result; or
b.
The MRO reports to the program manager that the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed. Program manager may direct a collection under direct observation of employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty test or a follow-up test.
(2)
The collector must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if they are directed by the program manager to do so, or if:
a.
The collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen; or
b.
The temperature on the original specimen was out of range; or
c.
The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
(c)
Employee requested testing.
(1)
Any employee who questions the results of a required drug test hereunder may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. The split sample test will occur regardless of up-front payment, but the city reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the employee. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee.
(2)
Any covered employee that has a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test will be immediately removed from all duties, informed of educational and rehabilitation programs available, and referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP) for assessment. A positive drug and/or alcohol test is cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel policies.
(d)
Pre-employment testing.
(1)
All candidates shall undergo urine drug testing immediately following the offer of employment or transfer into a new position. A negative drug test result is required prior to employment. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for 120 days. A substance abuse professional's certification of the absence of drug dependency that meets with the approval of the city, and negative pre-employment drug tests, will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
(2)
In addition, FTA requires all safety sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 or more days for any reason are required to successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of a safety-sensitive function. A pre-employment/pre-transfer test will also be performed anytime an employee's status changes from an inactive status in a safety-sensitive position to an active status in a safety-sensitive position (i.e., return from worker's comp. or leave of absence).
(e)
Reasonable suspicion testing.
(1)
All covered employees may be subject to urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to suspect drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A determination of reasonable suspicion for drug or alcohol testing must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations of appearance, speech, behavior and/or odors of the covered employee. Further evidence of reasonable suspicion includes, but is not limited to, the following:
a.
Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use or alcohol misuse.
b.
Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substances.
c.
Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused by prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse.
d.
Fights, assaults, and violations of established safety, security, or other operating procedures.
(2)
Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made in writing by a supervisor who has received at least 60 minutes of training to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use, and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited drug or alcohol use. Alcohol testing must be accomplished within eight hours of a reasonable suspicion determination. If testing is not done within eight hours, test attempts shall cease, and a written report explaining the failure to test shall be made. Drug testing may be done any time a covered employee is on duty.
(f)
Post-accident testing.
(1)
All covered employees must undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident. Covered employees whose performance could have contributed to the accident must be tested. A post-accident test will be conducted unless the employee's actions can be completely ruled out as a contributing factor to the accident.
(2)
Following an accident, the covered employees will be tested as soon as possible, but no later than eight hours after the accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours after the accident for drug testing. After such times have elapsed, no further testing shall be attempted and the reasons for any failures to test shall be recorded. Any covered employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight hours following the accident or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test. Any covered employee who leaves the scene of the accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing will be considered to have refused the test and shall be subject to discipline under the city personnel policies.
(g)
Random testing. Covered employees will be subject to random, unannounced testing. The selection of covered employees for random alcohol testing will be made using a scientifically valid method that ensures each covered employee of an equal chance of being selected each time selections are made. The random tests will be unannounced and spread throughout the year. Ten percent of covered employees will be tested each year for alcohol, and 50 percent of covered employees will be tested each year for drugs. Random drug tests may be conducted any time a covered employee is on duty.
(h)
Return to duty and follow-up testing. A negative drug and alcohol test is a requirement for return to duty. All covered employees who have returned to duty after removal for alcohol or drug use will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced random urine and/or breath testing. The testing will be performed for a period of one to five years, with a minimum of six tests to be performed the first year. Such testing shall also be performed after a substance abuse professional determines a covered employee needs help resolving drug or alcohol problems. Random alcohol tests and drug tests may be conducted any time a covered employee is on duty.
(i)
Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results of a required drug test may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. The employee pays all cost for such testing unless the result of the split sample test invalidates the results of the original test. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be in compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. The medical review officer (MRO) is Dr. Mark G. Catlin and Dr. Jennifer A. Collins, 402 W. County Road D, St. Paul, MN 55112, tel. 651-636-7466, 800-832-3244; the drug testing for all DOT employees will be performed by J&B Professional Drug and Alcohol Testing Service, John Copeland and Beverly Copeland, 178 Elks Club Road, Covington, Ga. 30014, 770-787-0762.
(j)
Random testing. Random alcohol and drug tests may be done any time a covered employee is on duty.
(Amend. of 5-12-2015)
Sec. 36-9. - Professional evaluation; discipline; proper application of the policy.
(a)
Any covered employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol above the minimum thresholds set forth in 49 CFR part 40, as amended, will be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse professional (SAP). An SAP is a licensed or certified physician, psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-related disorders. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse.
(b)
Evaluation by an SAP or participation in the city's employee assistance program does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement with the city. The city will not permit any covered employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions if it has actual knowledge that the employee is using alcohol or illegal drugs. The employee can be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary action. An employee who refuses an instruction to submit to a drug/alcohol test shall not be permitted to finish his or her shift and shall be terminated. A covered employee can be relieved of his/her responsibilities and subject to discipline for not fulfilling his/her responsibilities. Per city authority, violation of this substance abuse policy can result in termination of employment and/or exclusion from hire.
(c)
However, in the rare event an employee is reinstated with court order or other action beyond the control of the city, the employee must complete the return-to-duty process prior to the performance of safety-sensitive functions. All covered employees who previously tested positive on a drug or alcohol test or refused a test, must test negative for drugs and alcohol (below 0.02 for alcohol) and be evaluated and released by the substance abuse professional before returning to work. For an initial positive drug test a return-to-duty drug test is required and an alcohol test is allowed. For an initial positive alcohol test a return-to-duty alcohol test is required and a drug test is allowed. Following the initial assessment, the SAP will recommend a course of rehabilitation unique to the individual. The SAP will recommend the return-to-duty test only when the employee has successfully completed the treatment requirement and is known to be drug and alcohol-free and there are no objective concerns for public safety.
(d)
Covered employees that have returned to duty following a positive or refused test will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced drug and/or alcohol testing following the return-to-duty test. The follow-up testing will be performed for one to five years with a minimum of six tests to be performed the first year. The frequency and duration of the follow-up testing, tests (beyond the minimums), will be determined by the substance abuse professional (SAP) reflecting the SAP's assessment of the employee's unique situation and recovery progress. All follow-up urine drug collections will be conducted as directly observed collections in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.67, as amended. Follow-up testing should be frequent enough to deter and/or detect a relapse. Follow-up testing is separate and in addition to the random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion and return-to-duty testing.
(e)
The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or their insurance provider. Employees will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program.
(f)
City is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy. Therefore, supervisors/managers are required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Attachment B: Alcohol Fact Sheet
Alcohol is a socially acceptable drug that has been consumed throughout the world for centuries. It is considered a recreational beverage when consumed in moderation for enjoyment and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consumed primarily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a depressant, it slows down physical responses and progressively impairs mental functions.
Signs and symptoms of use: dulled mental processes, lack of coordination, odor of alcohol on breath, possible constricted pupils, sleepy or stuporous condition, slowed reaction rate, slurred speech. (Note: except for the odor, these are general signs and symptoms of any depressant substance.)
Health effects: the chronic consumption of alcohol (average of three servings per day of beer (12 ounces), whiskey (one ounce), or wine (six-ounce glass)) over time may result in the following health hazards: decreased sexual functioning, dependency (up to ten percent of all people who drink alcohol become physically and/or mentally dependent on alcohol and can be termed "alcoholic," fatal liver diseases, increased cancers of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus, rectum, breast, and malignant melanoma, kidney disease, pancreatitis, spontaneous abortion and neonatal mortality, ulcers, birth defects (up to 54 percent of all birth defects are alcohol related).
Social issues: two-thirds of all homicides are committed by people who drink prior to the crime. Two to three percent of the driving population is legally drunk at any one time. This rate is doubled at night and on weekends. Two-thirds of all Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related vehicle accident during their lifetimes. The rate of separation and divorce in families with alcohol dependency problems is seven times the average. Forty percent of family court cases are alcohol problem related. Alcoholics are 15 times more likely to commit suicide than are other segments of the population. More than 60 percent of burns, 40 percent of falls, 69 percent of boating accidents, and 76 percent of private aircraft accidents are alcohol related.
The annual toll: 24,000 people will die on the highway due to the legally impaired driver. 12,000 more will die on the highway due to the alcohol-affected driver. 15,800 will die in non-highway accidents. 30,000 will die due to alcohol-caused liver disease. 10,000 will die due to alcohol-induced brain disease or suicide. Up to another 125,000 will die due to alcohol-related conditions or accidents.
Workplace issues: it takes one hour for the average person (150 pounds) to process one serving of an alcoholic beverage from the body. Impairment in coordination and judgment can be objectively measured with as little as two drinks in the body. A person who is legally intoxicated is six times more likely to have an accident than a sober person.
