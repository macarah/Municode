(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 3.2. - Lafayette Road Overlay District.
(a)
Intent. The LaFayette Road Overlay District is established to implement the "District-Downtown" character area of the Catoosa County Comprehensive Plan, as amended, including establishing restrictions and standards pertaining to the use and the visual and architectural character of the LaFayette Road corridor and surrounding area. It is intended to encourage the most appropriate use of land, enhance the quality and compatibility of development, and to ensure building and site design complements the historic character of the area and is consistent with the Fort Oglethorpe Renaissance Strategic Vision and Plan. The application of use and design requirements will help to ensure that redevelopment and new development is visually and functionally appropriate for an area that is transitioning to a mix of "Main Street" commercial, residential, and institutional uses that generate pedestrian and economic activity and provide a community focal point reminiscent of a traditional downtown.
(b)
Boundaries. The LaFayette Road Overlay District boundaries include those properties bordering on LaFayette Road south from its intersection at Battlefield Parkway to the entrance of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. The overlay district includes parcels west of those that border on LaFayette Road to the Catoosa County line, with the exception of parcels having frontage on Barrett Drive, Coffman Drive, and Diane Lane, as well as parcels fronting Old LaFayette Road north of Coffman Drive.

The boundary of the LaFayette Road Overlay District is shown on the map attached the ordinance from which this appendix is dervied and by reference made a part hereof as Exhibit "A" — LaFayette Road Overlay District and shall be designated on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Fort Oglethorpe.
(c)
Applicability. Unless specifically addressed by this section 3.2, land and structures shall be used in accordance with the underlying zoning district, and regulations established by the UDC for uses and each zoning district shall be in effect. In any case where the provisions of the LaFayette Road Overlay District conflict with those of the underlying zoning district, the standards and requirements of the overlay district shall govern.

ARTICLE 4. - ALLOWED USES IN EACH ZONING DISTRICT

Sec. 4.1. - Intent of article.
This article identifies the principal uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval in each of the zoning districts, as well as uses to which certain restrictions apply.
(a)
A principal use is the specific, primary purpose for which or a building is used.
(b)
In specific areas covered by an overlay district, the overlay district imposes restrictions on uses not noted on the following use chart. The specifics of each overlay district under the city Code of Ordnances or this development code must be consulted as applicable to a particular property or area.
(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 4.2. - Chart of uses.
This article lists by the following matrix chart the principal uses allowed by right and by special exception approval in each zoning district, as described herein:
(a)
An "A" means that the use is allowed in the zoning district without any qualifications, except wherever such qualifications may be indicated in this development code. Such indication will also be noted in the righthand column of the chart of uses.
(b)
An "S" means that the use is allowed only by special exception approval. A listed special exception use is one which may be granted only when certain conditions are met in accordance with the special exception process described in the procedures and permits chapter. Additional restrictions may also apply, as noted in the righthand column of the chart of uses.
(c)
A blank space indicates that the use is not allowed under any circumstances.
(d)
In PM districts, uses that are allowed are established through approval of the planned development. See chapter 4 of this development code for details.
(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 4.3. - Restrictions on particular uses.
(a)
Principal uses.
(1)
Restrictions that apply to certain allowed or special exception principal uses are listed in the restrictions on particular uses chapter of this code (chapter 3).
(2)
For those uses that have specific restrictions associated with them, a reference is given on the use chart to the pertinent section in chapter 3.
(3)
Any provisions of chapter 3 in this development code that apply to development in general, however, are not indicated on the use chart.
(b)
Accessory and temporary uses. Restrictions on accessory and temporary uses are addressed in chapter 3 of this development code.
(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 4.4. - Prohibited uses.
Any principal use not shown on the following on use chart as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a special exception, is specifically prohibited.
(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
Sec. 4.5. - Interpretation of uses.
Some degree of interpretation will occasionally be required. It is not possible to list each and every variation or name of a given use.
(a)
In addition to other generally accepted references and resources, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (latest edition), may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on the following use chart and to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use. The NAICS classification number is shown on the use chart for each applicable use for reference and interpretation only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this code.
(b)
The NAICS assigns classification numbers to businesses and industries based on the primary business activity in which the company is engaged. While business activity usually corresponds to land use type, and therefore can be easily assigned to appropriate zoning districts, there are exceptions. Some businesses may be primarily engaged in a certain industry—such as telecommunications, for instance, like AT&T—but individual locations host notably different activities. For a company like AT&T, for instance, different facilities may include retail stores for telephones, offices for administrative functions, satellite and exchange switching stations, and repair and installation staging lots where heavy equipment vehicles, telephone poles, wire spools and materials are stored. As a result, interpretation is occasionally needed for an individual use, regardless of the business activity in which the parent company is engaged.
(1)
If no NAICS classification number is shown on the chart, there is no corresponding category to the land use listed. The use may be residential in nature (there are no NAICS categories for residences) or may be a land use activity not generally recognized as a business activity or industry type.
(2)
In all cases of uncertainty, the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the intent of the zoning district as stated in this chapter, both the common and dictionary definitions of the use, and the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity.
