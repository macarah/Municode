Sec. 86-70. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred location sites.
(1)
Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of a site; however locations which meet this criterion shall be subject to design and siting components of this article, and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the zoning administrator or the city council to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publically used structures. Publically used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publically used structures, placed on commercial or residential structures. Publically used structures include but are not limited to facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, lightpoles and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages or service stations shall be preferred locations, particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along the roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed-use buildings in high-density districts. Mixed-use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for a location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. No. 98-07, § 8-9-6, 4-13-1998)
Sec. 86-71. - General guidelines and requirements.
(a)
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(b)
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning commission an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city council or within one-quarter mile of the border, including specific information about the location, height coverage area, and design of each tower. The planning commission may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city council; however, the planning commission is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
(c)
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; however, the city council may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served by such waiver.
(1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(d)
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
(e)
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended. If upon inspection the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within 30 days, the city council may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
(f)
Licenses and authority. Owners and/or operators of towers and antennas shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system in the city have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises and/or licenses with the city.
(Ord. No. 98-07, § 8-9-7, 4-13-1998)
Sec. 86-72. - Permitted uses.
(a)
Generally. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses and shall not require administrative approval or a special use permit. Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply with this article and all other applicable ordinances.
(b)
Specific permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted:
(1)
Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with such tower or antenna, in any I-1, I-2 or C-2 commercial zoning district; however, such tower shall be set back from any existing on- or off-site residence a distance equal to the height of the tower;

(b)
Each new, modified, or replacement pole installed in the right-of-way that is not in a historic district or in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed the greater of: (i) Fifty feet above ground level; or (ii) Ten feet greater in height above ground level than the tallest existing pole in the same public right-of-way in place as of January 1, 2019, and located within 500 feet of the new proposed pole.
(c)
New small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way and collocated on an existing pole or support structure shall not exceed more than ten feet above the existing pole or support structure.
(d)
A decorative pole should only be located where an existing pole can be removed and replaced, or at a new location where the city has identified that a streetlight is necessary.
(e)
Unless it is determined that another design is less intrusive, or placement is required under applicable law, small wireless facilities shall be concealed as follows:
(1)
Antennas located at the top of poles and support structures shall be incorporated into the pole or support structure, or placed within shrouds of a size such that the antenna appears to be part of the pole or support structure.
(2)
Antennas placed elsewhere on a pole or support structure shall be integrated into the pole or support structure, or be designed and placed to minimize visual impacts.
(3)
Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and mounted on a pole shall be placed as high as possible, located to avoid interfering with, or creating any hazard to, any other use of the public rights-of-way, and located on one side of the pole. Unless the radio units or equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic signage, radio units or equipment cabinets mounted below the communications space on poles shall be designed so that the largest dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite side of the pole on which they are placed.
(4)
Wiring and cabling shall be neat and concealed within or flush to the pole or support structure, ensuring concealment of these components to the greatest extent possible.
(f)
Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, an applicant may collocate a small wireless facility within a historic district, and may place or replace a pole within a historic district, only upon satisfaction of the following: (i) issuance of a permit under section 86-103; and (ii) compliance with applicable codes.
(g)
Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, an applicant may collocate a small wireless facility on a decorative pole, or may replace a decorative pole with a new decorative pole, in the event the existing decorative pole will not structurally support the attachment, only upon satisfaction of the following: (i) issuance of a permit under section 86-103; and (ii) compliance with applicable codes.
