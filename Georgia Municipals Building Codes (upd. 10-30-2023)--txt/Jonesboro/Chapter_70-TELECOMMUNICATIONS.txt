Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-003 , § 1, adopted Jan. 8, 2018, repealed the former art. III, §§ 70-51—70-67, and enacted a new art. III as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 10-14-1996, § 1(8-8-1—8-8-16); Ord. No. 02-04, §§ 7—9, adopted June 10, 2002; and Ord. No. 05-05, §§ 1, 2, adopted Feb. 14, 2005.

Sec. 70-51. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines and regulations for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television, and radio telecommunications facilities, including all equipment and network components, any underlying support structure, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, accessory equipment, or other mechanisms used to provide and or aid the transmission of wireless data, cellular, television, radio, or other telecommunications services. The mayor and council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunication facilities, support structures, and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended. While mandated to make such provisions, the mayor and council also recognize that telecommunications facilities, such as towers and monopoles, telecommunication support structures, and antennas may negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and may reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such telecommunication support structures, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas.
The goals of this article, therefore, are:
(a)
To encourage the location of telecommunications facilities, including all telecommunication support structures, equipment, and/or antenna(s) in nonresidential areas;
(b)
To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by regulating the siting of and establishing development standards for wireless facilities and related wireless support structures, equipment, and infrastructure;
(c)
To minimize the total number of telecommunication support structures within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of the city;
(d)
To encourage the joint use of new and existing telecommunication support structure sites among providers;
(e)
To locate telecommunication facilities and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
(f)
To encourage the design and construction of telecommunication facilities and antennas in a manner that minimizes adverse visual impacts;
(g)
To follow and promote policies embodied in Section 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-1 et seq., in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services in the city;
(h)
To encourage the location of telecommunication support structures on municipal property but not in public parks; and
(i)
To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively, efficiently and safely.
(j)
To comply in good faith with the provisions of SB66, codified in Georgia Law as O.C.G.A. § 36-66C-1 et. seq., the "Streamlining Wireless Facilities and Antennas Act" ("Act"). If any provisions of this section or article as a whole conflict with the provisions of the Act, the provisions of the Act shall control.

All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts and shall consist of more than mere conclusory statements that no existing telecommunication support structure is suitable. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing telecommunication support structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following:
(1)
That no existing telecommunication support structures or suitable, authorized alternative telecommunication support structures are located within the geographic search area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
(2)
That existing telecommunication support structures or alternative telecommunication support structures within the geographic search area do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment. Such information shall be certified by a state-licensed professional engineer;
(3)
That the applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with public safety emergency communications or existing antenna(s) in the geographic search area, or the antenna(s) on the existing telecommunication support structures or alternative telecommunication support structures in the geographic search area would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna(s);
(4)
That the cost or contractual provisions required by the telecommunication support structure owner or co-owners to share an existing telecommunication support structure in the geographic search area or to adapt an existing telecommunication support structure for co-location are unreasonable. Costs exceeding the erection of a new telecommunication support structure are presumed to be unreasonable; and/or
(5)
That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing telecommunication support structures or authorized alternative telecommunication structures unsuitable for co-location.
(b)
For each of the above, the applicant must provide a listing of the existing telecommunication support structures or authorized alternative telecommunication support structures within the geographic search area that were considered, and ultimately rejected, by the applicant and provide a detailed explanation of why the existing telecommunication support structures or authorized alternative telecommunication structures within the geographic search area are not suitable.
