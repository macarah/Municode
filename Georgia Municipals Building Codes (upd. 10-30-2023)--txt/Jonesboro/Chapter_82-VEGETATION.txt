(Ord. No. 2020-013 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-13-2020)
Sec. 82-29. - Specimen tree criteria.
new
(a)
The following criteria are used by the zoning administrator to identify specimen trees for preservation. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify as a specimen, with the exception of trees designated as specimen trees for historic or cultural purposes. (Note: specimen trees do not necessarily have to be native trees.)
(1)
Size criteria.
a.
Large hardwood trees. Eighteen inches at diameter breast height (DBH) or larger—such as oaks, maples, elms, etc.
b.
Large softwood trees. Twenty-four inches at diameter breast height (DBH) or larger—such as pines, firs, spruces, etc.
c.
Specimen understory trees. Four inches at diameter breast height (DBH) or larger—such as dogwoods, redbuds, flowering cherries, etc.
d.
A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical or cultural significance, particularly in the historic district.
(2)
Condition criteria.
a.
At least ten years life expectancy.
b.
Trunk is relatively sound and solid with no extensive decay.
c.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs readily visible (hardwoods only).
d.
No major insect or pathological problem, per a certified arborist or other qualified authority report.
(b)
The critical root zone (CRZ) of specimen trees to be preserved shall be protected with hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support posts.
(c)
If a specimen tree is requested to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to the zoning administrator for approval, unless the developer/property owner has qualified for an exemption under section 82-30. For property owners with questions as to whether trees proposed to be removed qualify as specimen trees, the zoning administrator shall be contacted to confirm tree status onsite.
(d)
With the exception of already developed single-family detached and duplex residential lots, specimen trees that cannot be saved due to extenuating circumstances shall be replaced elsewhere on the same property, per the approval of the zoning administrator and the standards of section 82-33. Replacement trees shall be in quality condition and shall be the identical species of the specimen tree lost. If the identical species is unable to be found, the replacement tree equivalency list in section 82-39 shall be consulted. For sites which lack adequate room for replacement trees, the developer/property owner shall either plant the required amount of replacement trees on an approved City of Jonesboro tree bank site or recompense shall be paid to the City of Jonesboro tree fund, per the standards of section 82-34.
(e)
Any specimen tree which is intentionally or unintentionally removed, by definition of tree removal in section 82-25, without the appropriate review and approval of the zoning administrator, shall be subject to a citation in municipal court. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its previous condition. Violations will be subject to the applicable penalties as described in section 82-37. Any fines or other penalties imposed upon violations of this section shall be in addition to the required recompense measures that a developer/property owner would voluntarily submit to.
(f)
The zoning administrator shall reserve the right to request the assistance of certified professionals, and other qualified authorities, as the need may arise, to aid in the determination of specimen tree status, by species, size, and/or condition. All reports or other information by professionals concerning specimen trees (such as certified arborists' reports) shall be at the expense of the developer/property owner, save for public trees.
(Ord. No. 2020-013 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-13-2020)
Sec. 82-30. - Exemptions.
new
The following developments are exempted from compliance with the clearing and tree removal provisions of this article:
(a)
Removal due to death, disease or infestation. Upon the official report of a certified arborist, qualified representative of the state forestry commission, certified tree professional, extension service agent, or other qualified authority, and a finding of tree death, disease or infestation, the removal of one of more private specimen trees on a residential, commercial, institutional, or industrial property may be authorized to prevent the transmission of disease or infestation, to prevent the danger of these trees falling, or to prevent potential injury to life and property. The property owner, prior to removal of the diseased tree(s), shall notify the zoning administrator, identifying the location of the potentially affected tree(s), and shall submit the written report of the certified arborist or other qualified authority, recommending the removal of the subject tree(s). However, in no case shall the removal of diseased or infected specimen trees over time be a method of "gradual clear-cutting" of a property. Unless otherwise recommended by a qualified professional in order to prevent a spreading of disease or infestation, the removal of these type of specimen trees shall be limited to three or fewer per property per calendar year. Tree branches, portions of tree trunks, and other debris associated with any tree removal and/or maintenance shall be removed from the property on which it lies within 14 days after the completion of any tree cutting and/or pruning. If additional time is necessary, written approval for a time extension must be obtained from the city.
(b)
Removal to protect an existing structure. Certain private specimen trees, regardless of health condition, potentially pose an injury to life and property due to their proximity to existing homes and other types of manmade structures and their potential to fall upon these structures during storms, etc. The property owner, prior to removal of the subject specimen tree(s), shall notify the zoning administrator, identifying the location of the tree(s) in question. The zoning administrator shall promptly consult with the property owner on the subject property and shall document the size, species, and location of the tree(s) in question. The zoning administrator shall then give written approval or denial of the request to the property owner within three business days of the onsite consultation. If the request is denied, a written reason must also be given to the property owner. In the case of denial, a written appeal may be made to the mayor and city council. However, in no case shall the removal of potentially injurious specimen trees over time be a method of "gradual clear-cutting" of a property. The removal of these type of specimen trees shall be limited to three or fewer per property per calendar year. Tree branches, portions of tree trunks, and other debris associated with any tree removal and/or maintenance shall be removed from the property on which it lies within 14 days after the completion of any tree cutting and/or pruning. If additional time is necessary, written approval for a time extension must be obtained from the city.
(1)
Rights of property owners with tree and/or branch encroachments onto their properties. Property owners dealing with whole trees (whether specimen or not) and branches of trees encroaching onto their properties have certain rights and allowable practices to remediate the encroachment:
a.
Property owners shall have the right to cut off branches and roots that stray into their property. The affected property owner can trim only up to the boundary line and must obtain permission to enter the tree owner's property. A property owner cannot cut the entire tree down and cannot destroy the structural integrity or the cosmetic symmetry and appeal of a tree by improper trimming. A property owner who finds a neighbor's tree encroaching must first give notice to the tree owner prior to commencing work and give the tree owner the chance to correct the problem. If the tree owner does nothing, the tree can still be trimmed.
b.
If a tree owner allows the tree to grow so that it uproots a fence, it shall be considered an encroachment onto the adjacent property. In that instance, the tree owner shall be required to remove the offending tree.
c.
Leaves, flowers, pods, nuts, fruits, etc. which fall off and end up on adjacent property are considered a natural occurrence and are the responsibility of the landowner on whose property they ultimately come to rest.
d.
A boundary tree is one planted on the boundary line itself and shall not be removed without mutual agreement from the affected property owners.
(c)
Rights-of-way. The development of street rights-of-way, easements, or clear zones within a proposed subdivision or subdivision expansion provided that all other areas within such subdivision comply with the provisions of this article.
(d)
City authorized. State and city roadway projects. Also, any municipal projects on publicly-owned land.
(e)
Public trees. Specimen trees on city-owned and maintained property, which, for matters of public safety or other reasons, need to be removed.
(f)
Trail/pathways. Municipal projects designed and maintained under the City of Jonesboro's green space objectives.
(g)
Easements. Utility easements for power lines, pipelines, etc. (This includes necessary, but not excessive, pruning.)
(h)
Grandfathered projects.
(1)
This article shall not apply to any portion of a property included within the limits of a valid land disturbance permit issued prior to the effective date of this article, provided that all time constraints relating to the permit are observed.
(2)
In no event shall any grandfathered project be extended for more than 12 months from the date of enactment of this article.
(i)
Horticulture. Active horticultural operations, including:
(1)
All active plant or tree nurseries and botanical gardens only in relation to those trees which are being grown for relocation and continued growth in the ordinary course of business, or for some public purpose;
(2)
All orchards of trees in active commercial operation;
(3)
This exception shall not be interpreted to include timber-harvesting incidental to development of the land.
(j)
[Agricultural operations.] Bona fide agricultural operations as defined by this article.
(k)
General maintenance. Selective pruning associated with the preservation of a specimen tree. Tree branches, portions of tree trunks, and other debris associated with any tree removal and/or maintenance shall be removed from the property on which it lies within 14 days after the completion of any tree cutting and/or pruning. If additional time is necessary, written approval for a time extension must be obtained from the city.
(l)
[Non-qualifying vegetation.] Pruning, topping, and removal of any and all types of vegetation that does not qualify as specimen trees.
(m)
[Reasonable efforts to save.] Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees.

new
The following requirements shall apply to specimen trees proposed to be retained within a property (excepting already developed single-family detached and duplex residential lots), and, where applicable, trees within buffers:
(a)
Tree preservation area. A tree preservation area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
(1)
The tree preservation area shall include no less than the total area of the critical root zone of a tree or group of trees collectively.
(2)
Layout of the utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree preservation areas.
(3)
Construction site activities, such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burn hole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within the tree preservation areas.
(b)
Protective barriers.
(1)
Protective tree fencing, staking or continuous ribbon shall be installed between tree preservation areas and areas proposed to be cleared, graded or otherwise disturbed on the site, prior to any land disturbance. All protective barriers shall be installed according to the city standards of practice as outlined in this article.
(2)
All tree preservation areas are to be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted in addition to the required protection fencing, staking, or continuous ribbon. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree preservation standards are recommended for site entrances.
(3)
All tree preservation areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree preservation area.
(4)
All protective tree fencing, staking or continuous ribbon and all erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance and construction process, and should not be removed until final landscaping is installed.
(c)
Encroachment. If encroachment into a tree preservation area causes irreparable damage to the trees, as determined by a certified arborist of other qualified authority, the development plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss in tree density. The irreparably damaged trees shall be designated "lost trees" and lost tree penalties shall be enforced. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of the article, nor shall plan revision activities stop the department from instituting action for violation of this article.
(1)
New trees proposed as recompense for lost specimen trees on a property shall comply with the following guidelines:
a.
The spacing of new trees must be compatible with site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature;
b.
Trees must be at least four-inch caliper;
c.
Species selected for planting must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site;
d.
Species selected for planting shall be the identical species of the specimen tree lost. If the identical species is unable to be found, the replacement tree equivalency list in section 82-39 shall be consulted. Native/indigenous species are preferred;
e.
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability;
f.
In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve full recompense are not installed or likewise compensated to the city tree bank or tree bank fund upon application for a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate), then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 110 percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with the performance bonding requirements and provisions of city regulations;
g.
Upon final installation of new trees planted under the requirements of the article, and following acceptance by the department of community development, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for the exact replacement of those which do not survive for a period of no less than two years, as determined by the zoning administrator.
(d)
Removal. Anytime a tree is cut within the city, whether a public or private tree, the stump shall be removed and the land re-graded, compacted, and leveled where the tree was located.
(Ord. No. 2020-013 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-13-2020)
Sec. 82-33. - Tree replacement ratios.
new
For specimen tree recompense involving actual replacement tree planting on a subject property (excepting already developed single-family detached and duplex residential lots), the following replacement ratios shall apply:
(a)
For specimen hardwoods removed. An amount of same-species, replacement trees having a cumulative diameter breast height equivalent to the specimen tree removed. (Note: For replacement tree ratios that do not divide evenly, the remainder shall constitute an additional replacement tree.)
For example: A 20-inch maple specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with five four-inch caliper maples along the side of the same property. 20/4 = 5 trees
For example: A 21-inch maple specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with six four-inch caliper maples along the side of the same property. 21/4 = 5.25 = 6 trees
(b)
For specimen softwoods removed. An amount of same-species, replacement trees having a cumulative diameter breast height equivalent to half of the specimen tree removed. (Note: For replacement tree ratios that do not divide evenly, the remainder shall constitute an additional replacement tree.)
For example: A 24-inch pine specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with three four-inch caliper pines along the side of the same property. 24/2 = 12/4 = 3 trees
For example: A 26-inch pine specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with four four-inch caliper pines along the side of the same property. 26/2 = 13/4 = 3.25 = 4 trees
(c)
For specimen understory tree removed, 12 inches wide (DBH) and larger. An amount of same-species, replacement trees having a cumulative diameter breast height equivalent to the specimen tree removed. (Note: For replacement tree ratios that do not divide evenly, the remainder shall constitute an additional replacement tree.)
For example: A 12-inch dogwood specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with three four-inch caliper dogwoods along the side of the same property. 12/4 = 3 trees
For example: A 13-inch dogwood specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with four four-inch caliper dogwoods along the side of the same property. 13/4 = 3.25 = 4 trees
(d)
For specimen understory tree removed, below 12 inches wide (DBH). An amount of same-species, replacement trees double the amount of specimen trees removed.
For example: A five-inch dogwood specimen, unable to be saved in the middle of a development, is adequately replaced with two four-inch caliper dogwoods along the side of the same property. 1 tree x 2 = 2 trees
(Note: For replacement trees that are not able to be identical species to the specimen tree removed, refer to section 82-39 for equivalent replacements.)

Tree bank fund. The tree bank fund refers to a fund created to receive and hold monies paid by developers/property owners approved for specimen tree removal, in lieu of relocating or replacing trees when it is not feasible or desirable to do so on or off-site. Funds accumulated herein shall be used for the planting and installation of trees on public property, parks, schools, streetscapes, or other approved property within the city only.
(f)
Value. The established recompense value for monies paid into the tree bank fund shall be a sum of money reflecting the current market price of both materials and planting costs plus an additional ten percent of that price for maintenance.
