The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Apartment means one (1) or more rooms with a private bath and kitchen facilities comprising an independent self-contained residential unit in a building(s).
Condominium for the purposes of this section is defined in the same manner as it is defined in section 27-9.1.3.
Master meter means a utility-owned meter that measures and totalizes the volume of water flowing from the water distribution system into a multifamily dwelling unit as that term is defined in section 27-9.1.13, building piping system.
Newly constructed apartment means any structure for which a building permit for construction of an apartment is issued after June 1, 2008.
Newly constructed single-family dwelling or condominium means any structure for which a building permit for construction of a single-family dwelling or condominium is issued after June 1, 2008.
Separate water meter means a utility-owned meter that measures and totalizes the volume of water flowing from the water distribution system into a single-family dwelling or condominium's piping system.
Single-family dwelling for the purposes of this section is defined in the same manner as it is defined in section 27-9.1.3 but also includes dwelling units on an individual lot attached to another dwelling unit by a common party wall, commonly referred to as a town house or town home.
Sub-unit water meter means water meters owned and managed by the property owner with a utility-owned master meter that bills for water service based on volume of use. Sub-unit water meters shall allow for the water use in each apartment to be tracked separately.
(b)
Meters. All users not classified as fire line users shall be metered in accordance with the following:
(1)
All meters shall be sized on the basis of expected volume of water usage.
(2)
All meters, except sub meters, are deemed to be part of the service line provided by the county and are the property of the county.
(c)
Private fire lines. Lines supplying commercial buildings shall have meters installed in accordance with section (b)(1) and (b)(2) above and the following:

Sec. 25-102. - Classification of users.
The following list of system users establishes classifications of service as a basis of charges:
(1)
Single. All dwelling, commercial and industrial customers are in this classification who use all of the water supplied through a connection for any use besides fire protection.
(2)
Fire line. A customer shall only use the connection applied for under this classification for fire protection.
(3)
Combined potable and fire line. Any shopping center and/or other development served by a combination potable and fire line located outside the public right-of-way shall be classified as a combined potable and fire line user, where either of the following exists:
a.
A fire line main is served through a master meter with potable water service taken from that fire line main within the development.
b.
Potable water is taken from the fire line through multiple meters.
(4)
Multiple. No multiple dwelling, commercial or industrial customers shall be on one (1) meter, except in case of apartments, shopping centers and office parks, where in the judgment of the director multiple meters are impractical. Approved multiple category customers shall have one (1) meter per premises and shall be charged as single category users.

(Code 1976, § 6-1072)
Sec. 25-103. - Recurring charges.
The following charges are set by the board of commissioners and shall be billed on a recurring basis as continuing charges:
(1)
Service. All classifications of users except fire line shall be billed a base charge for service availability, whether service is used or not. This charge shall be fixed on the basis of meter size. For combined potable and fire line users who provide a specific means of determining the requirements of the development, such as by the installation of private meters by the owner, the service charge shall be based on the number and size of private meters installed.
(2)
Commodity. All classifications of users except fire line shall be billed a commodity charge in addition to a service charge on the basis of actual volume of water delivered at the single unit volume rate set by the board of commissioners.
(3)
Fire line. Fire line customers shall be billed for service availability on the basis of diameter of connection to system mains and number of fire hydrants on premises. If a building complex has establishments each with different owners, then the fire line charges will be prorated by the director based on square footage protected. For combined potable and fire line users:
a.
Where fire hydrants are installed on private lines served through a master meter and/or where such lines serve building sprinkler systems, the owner will be billed for fire service availability on the basis of diameter of connection required to the system mains for fire protection only and on the number of hydrants. There will be no charge, however, for any hydrant which is determined by the county to be adjacent to and available to a public roadway. In addition, potable water readiness to serve charge will be based on the size line required for estimated average flow based on commodity billing as determined by the county.
b.
Where an owner elects to dedicate lines and rights-of-way outside the public road right-of-way in order to utilize multiple meters and where such lines have hydrants installed or serve building sprinkler systems, the owner will be billed for fire service availability on the basis of diameter of connection required to the system mains for fire protection only and on the number of fire hydrants. There will be no charge, however, for any hydrant which is determined by the county to be adjacent to and available to a public roadway. If a building complex has establishments each with different owners, then the fire line charges will be prorated by the county based on square footage protected.
(4)
Contract. Contract service is only by agreement. Billing shall be on the basis of a service charge plus metered volume of water delivered at the unit volume rate set by the board of commissioners. Billing shall be at equal periods set by the board and not less than semiannually.
(Code 1976, § 6-1073; Ord. No. 92-24, 7-28-92)
Sec. 25-104. - Miscellaneous charges.
(a)
Certain noncontinuous services provided by the county water system have set charges as designated by the county. Charges shall be reviewed from time to time to assure that they cover the cost of services.

(6)
Meter testing. The county may periodically test all meters on its system. A customer may request a test to be made without charge.
(7)
