C.
To encourage property owners to improve and renovate existing housing stock rather than demolish the same; and
D.
To establish and maintain a balance between preserving the character of mature neighborhoods while accommodating compatible new residential development; and
E.
To allow neighborhoods an opportunity to establish architectural standards that will preserve the character of their existing neighborhoods.

All portions of a tower or antenna that extend above the top of the existing mature tree canopy pursuant to subsection B.1., shall consist of an alternative tower structure that is designed and colored in a way that blends said tower or antenna with the closest tree canopy to a degree that renders said tower or antenna indistinguishable from said tree canopy at a distance of two hundred (200) feet measured horizontally from said tower or antenna.
