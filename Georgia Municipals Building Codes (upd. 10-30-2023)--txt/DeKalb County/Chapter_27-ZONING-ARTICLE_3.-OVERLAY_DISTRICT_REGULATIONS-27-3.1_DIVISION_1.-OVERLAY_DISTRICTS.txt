27-3.1 DIVISION 1. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS

Sec. 3.1.1. - Overlay districts generally.
Overlay districts are supplemental to the zoning district classifications established in article 2 of this chapter. This section shall supersede the applicability statements in each overlay district, and are applicable as follows:
A.
All development and building permits for lots located, in whole or in part, within any overlay district shall meet all of the regulations of the underlying zoning district in which they are located as well as all of the regulations of the applicable overlay district.
B.
For new development after the effective date of this chapter, when no complete application for a land disturbance or building permit has been filed with respect to a property located within an overlay district and the property has conditions of zoning that were approved prior to, and in conflict with the overlay district regulations contained in this article, the overlay district regulations shall prevail. If a condition of zoning does not conflict with the overlay district regulations, the condition of zoning shall remain applicable to the property.
C.
For existing development, if overlay district regulations conflict with the conditions of zoning applicable to property within in an overlay district, the existing zoning conditions remain applicable to the property.
D.
If a use is permitted in the overlay district, but the underlying zoning requires a special land use permit for the same use, the overlay shall govern, and no special land use permit is required.
E.
If overlay district regulations conflict with other regulations contained in this chapter, the overlay district regulations shall prevail.
F.
The use of property may be permitted without rezoning if listed as allowed by the overlay. Uses allowed by the underlying zoning in article 4, may also be permitted in the overlay district, unless it is listed as prohibited or if the zoning district is not applicable in the overlay.
G.
Each application for a business license, land disturbance permit, building permit or sign permit, which involves the development, use, exterior alteration, exterior modification or addition of any structure, must demonstrate compliance with all overlay district regulations, subject to article 8, nonconforming uses, structures and buildings.
H.
The zoning district designations contained in article 3, titled Overlay District Regulations, were not revised to reflect the new zoning district designations utilized in the updated zoning ordinance effective June 1, 2015. The discontinued zoning district references contained in this article 3 shall therefore be construed using the conversion chart contained in Table 1.1 of article 1 of the zoning ordinance effective June 1, 2015, and applied as appropriate to the updated provision of the zoning ordinance.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.1.2. - Purpose and intent.
Each Subarea Overlay has its own purpose and intent based on original overlay requirements.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.1.3. - Plan submittal, review and approval (certificate of complianceâ€”See Emory Village for additional requirements associated with historic preservation).
A.
Pre-submittal conference. Prior to the submittal for review of a land disturbance or building permit application for property located within an overlay district, the applicant and the staff shall have a preliminary meeting to discuss the submittal requirements.
B.
Conceptual plan submittal requirements. As part of any land-disturbance permit, building permit, or sign permit application, the applicant shall submit to the director of planning a conceptual plan package and a final design package. Each package must include full architectural and landscape plans and specifications. The submitted plans must include a site plan, architectural elevations and sections; renderings depicting the building design including elevations and architectural details of proposed buildings, exterior materials and colors, and plans and elevations of all hardscape, landscape and signs, all of which shall demonstrate that the proposed design is in compliance with all the requirements of the applicable overlay district and the underlying zoning classification. The director of planning shall provide a copy of the submittals to the district commissioners, at-large commissioners and the citizen stakeholder in whose district or area the property is located for review and comments. If the proposed development is also located in an historic district as designated in the Code, the development shall also comply with the regulations established for the historic district in chapter 13.5 of the Code.
C.
Review by staff. Staff will review the conceptual plans for compliance with specifications and design guidelines contained in this zoning ordinance. If the application fails to comply with any section in this zoning ordinance, the application shall be marked "failed compliance," shall be returned to the applicant with any comments and/or redlines for revisions, and may be re-submitted with corrections addressing the staff's comments and/or redlines for further consideration. Once the application is found to be in compliance, the final design shall be forwarded to the director of planning for approval.
1.
Where the director of planning determines that said plans comply with the requirements of the overlay district, the director of planning shall approve the plans for compliance as part of the application for land disturbance, building or signs permits.
2.
Where the director of planning determines that submitted conceptual plans do not comply with the requirements of this chapter, then the director of planning shall notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which the conceptual plans fail to comply with such requirements. All applications shall be considered and decided by the director of planning within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application.
3.
Any appeal to vary overlay district development standards shall be to the zoning board of appeals pursuant to article 7.
D.
Fees. Plans shall be accompanied by an application and payment of a fee in an amount determined by the board of commissioners.

A.
The conceptual plan package shall include the following:
1.
A narrative addressing the proposed development explaining how it meets the purpose, intent, and standards of this article. The narrative shall include a tabulation of the approximate number of acres for each different land use type within the project, the approximate number of dwelling units by type, the approximate gross residential density, the approximate commercial density as well as square feet, the common open space acreage, the approximate open space acreage, the anticipated number, type and size of recreational facilities and other public amenities, and the legal mechanism for protecting and maintaining common/public open, as required in article 5;
2.

The multimodal access plan shall cover the entire proposed development along with public right-of-way of adjoining streets and any other property lying between the subject property and any primary or secondary streets. Safe and convenient pathways shall be provided from sidewalks along streets to each structure entrance, including pedestrian access routes across parking lots and between adjacent buildings within the same development. Connections to available transportation nodes, such as driveways, sidewalks, and bike paths shall be shown along adjacent streets and those entering adjoining properties. Where an existing or planned public transportation station or stop is within one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet from the nearest boundary of the subject property, the access plan shall show how pedestrians may safely travel from such station or stop to the subject property. Where an existing or planned bike path is located within one thousand five hundred feet (1,500) feet from the nearest boundary of the subject property, the access plan shall show how safe, continuous and convenient bicycle access shall be provided to the subject property.
