Sec. 13-301. - Purpose and findings.
The governing authority finds that the unregulated operation of body craft studios and tattoo procedures constitutes a health risk to the general public, and poses a significant risk of transfer of communicable diseases, infections, pathogens and other harmful agents to and among the citizens of DeKalb County. Substandard and poor sanitary conditions exist in the body craft and tattoo industry in DeKalb County, and these unsanitary conditions pose a health risk to the safety and welfare of the general public. These regulations include reasonable standards that will ameliorate the substandard sanitary conditions in this industry and serve to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of DeKalb County and the individuals who utilize body craft and tattoo procedure rooms. The county finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and general welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations.
