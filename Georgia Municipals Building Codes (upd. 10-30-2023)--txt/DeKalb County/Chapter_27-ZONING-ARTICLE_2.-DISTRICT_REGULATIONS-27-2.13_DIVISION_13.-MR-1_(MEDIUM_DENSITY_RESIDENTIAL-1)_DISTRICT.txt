Use of bonuses shall permit a development to exceed the maximum base density established for the district in which the development property is located, provided that in no case shall a development exceed the maximum density allowed by the character area in which the property is located, according to the future development map adopted at the time of land disturbance permit application. Table 2.7 describes the maximum allowed dwelling unit density after application of any bonuses.

Density determination of each MR-1 (Medium Density Residential-1) property:
1.
Existing MR-1 properties: For existing properties converted to MR-1 (Medium Density Residential-1) District classification at the effective date of this chapter:
a.
Where conditions of zoning regulating density have been attached to the property, maximum density shall remain as established.
b.
Where no conditions of zoning regulating density have been attached to the property, maximum density shall be the "Base Max" described in Table 2.7, unless administratively reviewed and approved for bonus increases, according to the criteria set forth in subsection C. below.
2.
New MR-1 properties: For property rezoned to the MR-1 (Medium Density Residential-1) District classification after the effective date of this chapter, density shall be established by the board of commissioners at the time of approval, based upon the criteria set forth in subsection C. below.
C.
Density bonus eligibility and calculations. Density bonuses are intended for subdivisions as defined in this chapter, not for individual infill lots. The maximum allowed density on MR-1 (Medium Density Residential-1) District zoned property may be increased above the "base max" by application of density bonuses as indicated by Table 2.6, and may be accumulated if eligible. An example of how allowable density bonuses are calculated is shown in the example at the end of Table 2.6. In no case shall density exceed the bonus maximum established by Table 2.7.
