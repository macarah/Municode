(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 2; Acts 2010, p. 3548, § 1)
Sec. 568. - Findings; purposes; authority.
(a)
The general assembly finds that the kind, character, type, and degree of district services provided by DeKalb County varies among DeKalb municipalities and between those municipalities and the unincorporated area of the county. Based on studies of the provision of district services by DeKalb County, the general assembly further finds that the variation in the provision of district services is quantifiable for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area so that the DeKalb County ad valorem tax levied to finance the provision of district services may be adjusted by a factor established by law for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area to the end that the rate of such ad valorem tax shall bear a reasonable relationship to the value of district services actually received by residents of the county within each DeKalb municipality and within the unincorporated area. It is the purpose of this act [division] to implement the intention of the constitutional amendment by establishing the factor for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area which DeKalb County shall be required to apply to the county ad valorem tax levied to finance the provision of district services to adjust the millage rate of such tax for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area.
(b)
This act [division] is pursuant to the authority of the constitutional amendment which specifically provides that ". . . the general assembly shall be authorized by law to control the subject matter of this paragraph and to further define and implement the provisions thereof, including the deletion of services designated herein as `district services' or the addition of other `district services,' or any combination thereof, in such manner and pursuant to such terms and conditions as the general assembly may provide by such law."
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 3)
Sec. 569. - Special services tax districts.
Each DeKalb municipality shall constitute a special services tax district composed of that portion of DeKalb County lying within the corporate limits of each respective DeKalb municipality, and the unincorporated areas shall constitute a special services tax district composed of all the unincorporated areas of DeKalb County. For the purposes of this Act, each such special services tax district shall be designated by the name of its respective DeKalb municipality, except for that portion of DeKalb County lying within the corporate limits of the City of Atlanta, which shall be designated "Atlanta in DeKalb," and the unincorporated area, which shall be designated "DeKalb."

(4)
The amount determined under paragraph (3) shall be converted to an ad valorem tax millage rate based on the countywide tax digest, and the millage rate so established shall be the district services ad valorem tax millage rate.

Sec. 571.2. - Particularized millage rates for governmental services.
(a)
Particularized millage rate. After the county determines the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality as provided in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division], the county shall calculate a particularized millage rate applicable to each DeKalb municipality for each governmental service. The particularized millage rate shall be used to reduce a DeKalb municipality's adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate in the event such municipality declines governmental services.
(b)
Standardization for parks and roads governmental services. In determining a particularized millage rate for parks and roads governmental services, as defined in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsections 567(4)(C), (D) of this division], the county shall establish a standardized particularized millage rate so that annually each DeKalb municipality shall be subject to the same standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services. The standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services may fluctuate annually based on budgetary levels, but the rate charged to DeKalb municipalities shall not exceed the rate charged to DeKalb.
(c)
Calculation. The county shall calculate the particularized millage rate in the following manner: The county shall determine the total budgeted appropriations for district services for all special services tax districts and then divide the budgeted appropriations allocated to each governmental service by the total budgeted appropriations. Each resulting number shall be the percentage of appropriations allocated to each governmental service which shall then be multiplied by the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality reflected in subsection (b.1) of Section 6 of this Act [subsection 571(b.1) of this division]. The resulting numbers shall be the raw particularized millage rates. The county shall use the raw particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services to assist in establishing the standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services. The county shall deduct the standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services from the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality and shall separate the resulting number into a particularized millage rate for each municipality for basic and nonbasic police services based on the proportion that the budgeted appropriation for each police service bears to the total police services budgeted appropriations. The particularized millage rates for each governmental service may fluctuate annually based on budgetary levels.
(d)
Real estate tax statement. Beginning with the year 2011 the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for basic police services and nonbasic police services identified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsections 567(4)(A), (B) of this division] shall be reflected on the real estate tax statement as a separate line item tax for each such district service, and the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for the remaining district services identified in paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division] shall be reflected on the real estate tax statement as a single line item tax.

The provisions of this act [division] shall apply only to district services, as defined by paragraph (4) of section 2 of this act [§ 567 of this appendix], provided by DeKalb County and shall not affect ad valorem taxes levied by DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities or other sources of revenue available to the county or DeKalb municipalities to fund other governmental services. Nothing in this act [division] shall be construed to prohibit DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities from creating other or additional special service tax districts or from entering into contracts with each other governing the provision of other governmental services. However, unless pursuant to a contract authorized by section 8 of this act [§ 573 of this appendix], the requirements of this act [division] shall not be superseded or abrogated by the exercise of any powers possessed by DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities.

Sec. 573. - Contracts for district services.
(a)

In the event any such contract is entered into, the requirements of this act [division], as to the DeKalb municipality entering the contract, shall be suspended during the period the contract is in effect, and the provision of district services by DeKalb County within the DeKalb municipality entering into the contract and the funding of such district services shall be controlled by the contract.
(b)
In the event DeKalb County and a DeKalb municipality enter into a contract authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the adjustment to the district services ad valorem tax millage rate for the unincorporated area shall be the millage rate applied to taxable property within the unincorporated area which will produce the total amount determined under paragraph (3) of section 5 of this act [§ 570 of this appendix] less:
(1)
The amount derived by DeKalb County from special services tax districts, except the special service[s] tax district of the DeKalb municipality which has entered into a contract with DeKalb County, from the adjusted ad valorem tax millage rates levied pursuant to subsection (b) of section 6 of this act [§ 571 of this appendix]; and
(2)
The amount derived, if any, by DeKalb County from the DeKalb municipality which has entered into a contract with the county in payment for the provisions of district services within the municipality by the county.
(c)
In the absence of a contract authorized by this section or upon the expiration of any such contract or upon any such contract ceasing to be effective for any reason, the provisions of this act [division] shall govern ad valorem taxes levied by DeKalb County within each special services tax district to finance the provisions of district services by the county.
(d)

Sec. 574. - Declined governmental services.
Each DeKalb municipality comprising a special services tax district shall receive all district services and shall be subject to the adjusted district services ad valorem tax as calculated in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division], unless the governing body of a DeKalb municipality declines any governmental services as follows:
(1)
Beginning with the year 2011, the governing body of any DeKalb municipality may decline to have DeKalb County perform any or all district services as defined by paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division] by delivering to DeKalb County a fully executed, valid resolution of its governing body identifying the declined governmental services. Such DeKalb municipality resolution shall be delivered to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County, via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before September 30, 2010. If a fully executed, valid resolution is received by the chief executive officer and commissioners of DeKalb County in the manner required by this paragraph, then the county shall reduce that municipality's adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services by the particularized millage rate of the declined governmental services, effective beginning January 1, 2011, and continuing thereafter from year to year unless modified in the manner provided in paragraph (2) of this section.
(2)
After January 1, 2011, if a DeKalb municipality chooses to decline a district service, whether alone or in addition to already declined district services, the governing body of such DeKalb municipality may deliver to DeKalb County a new resolution identifying any declined governmental services. Such DeKalb municipality resolution shall be delivered to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County, via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before June 30. In the event a fully executed, valid resolution is received by the chief executive officer and the commissioners of DeKalb County in the manner required by this paragraph, then in the new year following receipt of such resolution, the county shall reduce that municipality's adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services by the particularized millage rate of the declined governmental services.
(3)
If any DeKalb municipality fails to enact a resolution in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, then the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for that DeKalb municipality shall be calculated in the manner set forth in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division]. If the county ceases entirely to perform one of the district services identified in paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division], then each DeKalb municipality shall have its adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services reduced by the particularized millage rate for that discontinued service.
(4)
If any DeKalb municipality enacts a resolution as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, DeKalb County shall provide no declined governmental services to that DeKalb municipality unless and until DeKalb County agrees to restore a previously declined governmental service in the manner provided in paragraph (5) of this section.
(5)
The governing body of any DeKalb municipality may request that the county perform a previously declined governmental service by forwarding a written request to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County identifying with specificity the governmental service sought. The request shall be forwarded via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before June 30. The governing authority of DeKalb County may, in its sole discretion, decide whether it will provide the previously declined governmental service to the DeKalb municipality. The finance director shall forward the county's decision in writing to the mayor of the affected DeKalb municipality within 15 business days of the county making its decision, and the county shall make its decision within 90 days of receiving a DeKalb municipality's request. If the county agrees to provide the previously declined governmental service, the county shall begin providing the governmental service on January 1 of the new year following receipt of the resolution, and an increased adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services shall be determined and levied in conformity with the applicable requirements of this Act.
