Sec. 6-23. - Open area and patio sales.
(a)
Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on-premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the county commission.
(b)
The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by a fence, wall, or some other structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. A parking lot shall not qualify as such an open area.
(c)
The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet above the patio floor, but the structure does not have to be solid or restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the county's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by governing regulations or codes.
(d)
The only exit from this area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
(e)
If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area at an existing licensed structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the director with a right of appeal to the commission in the event of a denial. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the county's development and fire codes.
(f)
Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. "Patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, do not have to conform to the standards in this section.

(b)
It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.

(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-32. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Preamble and purpose.
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the board of commissioners believe are relevant to the problems faced by the county and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, as well as the testimony of citizens and experts received by this commission, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity.
(b)
Prohibited activities. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities:
(1)
The employment or use of any person in any capacity in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals;
(2)
Live entertainment that provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing or the performance of obscene acts that simulate:
a.
Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts that are prohibited by law;
b.
The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
c.
The display of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals;
(3)
The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section which are obscene under state law; or
(4)
The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct.
(c)
Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this article shall be or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or to restaurants or places set apart for traditional naturism where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or the mainstream activity of such establishment. The phrase "places set apart for traditional naturism" means places provided or set apart for traditional naturism including nudist parks, clubs, and resorts affiliated with the American Association for Nude Recreation, the Naturists Society or other naturist organization, and has been in operation as a naturist facility for at least 24 months prior to application for a license.
