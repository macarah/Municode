(a)
No holder or employee of the holder of a license authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages shall do any of the following upon the licensed premises:
(1)
Knowingly sell or offer to sell distilled spirits, malt beverages or wines to any person under the age of 21 years. In any case where a reasonable person could reasonably be in doubt as to whether or not the person seeking to obtain distilled spirits, malt beverages or wines is actually 21 years of age or older, it shall be the duty of the person selling or otherwise furnishing said alcoholic beverages to request and be furnished with proper identification in order to verify the age of such person. Failure to make such a request and to verify the purchaser's age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether any sale to an underage person was made knowingly. The term "proper identification" means any document issued by a governmental agency containing a description of the person, such person's photograph, or both, and giving such person's date of birth. The term "proper identification" includes, but is not limited to, a passport, military identification card, driver's license, or a state issued identification card.
(2)
Sell or offer to sell any alcoholic beverages to any person who is noticeably intoxicated, who is of unsound mind, or who is a habitual drunkard whose intemperate habits are known to the licensee or his employees.
(3)
Sell alcoholic beverages upon the licensed premises or permit alcoholic beverages to be consumed thereon, on any day or at any time when the sale or consumption is prohibited by law.
(4)
Sell any alcoholic beverage to an adult with knowledge or reason to know that the adult is purchasing the alcoholic beverage for a minor.
(b)
Individual employees who violate this section shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 6-100 as well as to loss of their employee license/permit. Penalties for license holders shall be determined by the county commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including, in addition to any criminal penalties, possible suspension, probation, revocation or non-renewal of the license or imposition or conditions to or restrictions upon operations.
(c)
As to the penalties in subsection (b) of this section, if there is a change in a majority of the licensed establishments' owners, partners or shareholders, the violations under the old ownership shall not count against the new owners; however, a different corporation, partnership or other association will be charged with the violations of its predecessor(s) if a majority of the owners, partners or shareholders are the same.
