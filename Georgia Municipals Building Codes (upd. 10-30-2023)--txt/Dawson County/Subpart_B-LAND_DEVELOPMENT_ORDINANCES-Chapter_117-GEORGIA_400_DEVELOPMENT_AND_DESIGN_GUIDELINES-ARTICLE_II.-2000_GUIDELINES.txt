ARTICLE II. - 2000 GUIDELINES
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Secs. 117-19—117-39. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Sec. 117-40. - About urban design.
(a)
It is the intent of this corridor plan to provide detailed design guidelines for developments in the SR 400 corridor from the Forsyth County line to the Lumpkin County line. This plan is implemented by ordinance to be adopted by the board of commissioners.
(b)
Urban design is a discipline that describes and evaluates the characteristics and interrelationships of all elements of the three-dimensional form of the urban environment. Urban designers use an interdisciplinary approach that combines architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning. Urban designers interrelate and arrange various elements of the built environment—distance, materials, scales, views, building style, road alignments, vegetation and other items—to form an attractive built environment. In doing so, urban designers are concerned not only with people observing the built environment from fixed points with particular developments, but also with observers moving by and perceiving buildings from further distances.
(c)
Careful attention to attractive and pedestrian-friendly urban design is in the economic interests of the county, its citizens, and business owners. Attractive and integrated urban design features tend to improve an area's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. Research and experience have shown that there is a positive return on investment for design features, for both government and property owners. For example, the money a community spends on landscaped roadway medians, sidewalks, and street trees is likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue resulting from the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and desirable urban areas.
(d)
Design guidelines are a set of criteria, uniformly applied in the planning approval process, to evaluate the appropriateness of proposed changes to individual properties in a designated district. The ultimate goal of design guidelines is to direct physical and visual changes in the district to create an architecturally and physically cohesive area of specified character. Design guidelines are meant to create a strong identity for the area as a distinctive place to shop, visit, work, and live. Design guidelines are a means of bringing together the interests of individual property owners and the general public to achieve mutual benefits.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-41. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The subject area, the Georgia 400 corridor, contains multiple property owners with differing interests. Developers in the corridor have commissioned or will commission different architects, each with their own unique motivations and styles. As projects are designed and developed in the corridor, designers tend to focus on their own site as a self-contained unit.
(b)
Left to its own workings, the real estate market has already shown signs that it will produce development that is dominated by single-function land uses, buildings that are not coordinated with adjacent buildings and isolated from other uses, and circulation systems that serve exclusively the automobile. The intersection of Georgia 400 and State Route 53 has already developed as the equivalent of a city center at a highway interchange—shopping centers, restaurants, hotels, and apartments—one where buildings do not fully relate to one another and where the only way to get around is by car. The Georgia 400/State Route 53 interchange development represents at least a partial example where urban design opportunities have been overlooked—a lost opportunity of sorts.
(c)
Without guidance from the county, future developments in the Georgia 400 corridor will likely be self-contained, fragmented compartmentalized, without coherence and relationship with other developments. Without guidance, developers are unlikely to interrelate streets, buildings, human uses, and natural systems in a manner that results in a coordinated, pleasing, and sustainable built environment across property lines. Unless additional guidance is provided, the corridor will most likely witness additional development that results in an uncoordinated jumble of box stores, repetitive parking lot entrances, and blank building walls.
(d)
The purpose of these guidelines is to help site planners and urban designers look beyond their individual buildings and single parcels of land to shape the physical features of their development in a manner consistent with preferred principles of community design. The guidelines seek to help unify what would otherwise become a disparate and irreconcilable collection of land uses and architectural traditions.
(e)
In presenting these guidelines, however, it is not the county's intent to adopt an overall architectural theme for the corridor. The corridor is not envisioned to become one monotonous strip where all shopping centers look the same, or are designed to provide one big festival marketplace. No single checklist can define what is good and bad design. Rather, the county intends to provide general guidance while allowing site designers the flexibility to propose multiple ways of meeting the letter and spirit of the guidelines. Furthermore, it is not the intent of these guidelines to try and convert what is surely an auto-related corridor into purely pedestrian friendly developments. However, elements of human scale and reasonable accommodations for pedestrians are integral components of the guidelines.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-42. - Georgia 400 corridor.
The development and design guidelines contained in this document shall apply to the Georgia 400 overlay district shown on the following corridor boundary map. All parcels lying wholly or partially within the corridor boundary shall be subject to these guidelines.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-43. - Existing conditions and vision for the corridor.
(a)
The Dawson County, Georgia, 400 overlay zone addresses the area adjacent to Georgia 400. The southern part of the corridor is currently (Year 2000) undergoing intense development pressure. Since this area is the main gateway to Dawson County, the development within this zone will have an immediate impact on how residents and travelers view the community. While development is logically suited for this area, it must be done in a quality, well-planned manner.
(b)
High quality, mixed use development of commercial, light industrial, office, and residential is highly encouraged in this area. The southern portion of the corridor should have visual and functional designs that will create a pleasing environment for people to shop, conduct business, and reside. The long-term maintenance of this corridor as a place of distinctive character is in the vital interests of Dawson County.
(c)
The northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor is still fairly rural in character. Development within this zone should attempt to retain a rural character through carefully planned site layout, landscaping, and architecture. Mixed use development of commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and residential that is compatible with the visual quality of this portion of the corridor is highly encouraged. Certain guidelines established herein apply only to the northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor.
GA 400 North, north of commercial center at intersection of SR 53
(d)
The northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor is still quite rural. The guidelines encourage the maintenance of a more rural landscape in the north portion of the corridor, through a buffer requirement along the right-of-way and a higher landscaped coverage ratio.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1.4; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Secs. 117-44—117-74. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - SITE PLANNING AND GRADING
Subdivision I. - In General

Secs. 117-75—117-91. - Reserved.
Subdivision II. - Site Planning

Sec. 117-92. - Relate design to site and surroundings.
(a)
The site plan, building design and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance, which will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area. Exterior maintenance or alterations, whether structural, or cosmetic, or changes in material, to developments within this corridor which are in conflict with the requirements for new construction are specifically not permitted.
(b)
Site planning and design of projects proposed adjacent to dissimilar land uses should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns. When proposed adjacent to one or more dissimilar land uses, the development must mitigate impacts by carefully addressing the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-93. - Evaluate, retain, and incorporate natural features.
(a)
Evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development. Development should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment.
(b)
Significant site features such as natural ground forms, large rock outcroppings; water and significant view corridors shall be identified and should be incorporated into development plans.
(c)
Riparian zones, stream corridors, and wetlands should be protected for their wildlife habitat and other values. Development plans for these areas should treat these components as assets. The alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas may be permitted so long as relevant regulations are followed, potential losses are mitigated, and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage.
(d)
Preserve patches of high-quality habitat, as large and circular as possible, feathered at the edges, and connected by wildlife corridors.
(e)
The design of outdoor spaces should recognize and incorporate views, solar angles, climate, and the nature of outdoor activities which could occur in conjunction with the project.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-94. - Protect environmentally sensitive areas.
(a)
Conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat.
(b)
Limit development in environmentally sensitive areas such as severe topography and areas with drainage problems. This guideline is considered particularly applicable in the northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor.
(c)
Major considerations concerning water quality should include: organic pollution from infiltration and surface runoff; erosion and sedimentation; water temperature elevation; nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; and toxic materials.
(d)
Flood plain storage should not be decreased from its present state. Utilize areas of flood plain for open space and recreational purpose, whenever possible.
(e)
Restore and enhance environmental functions damaged by prior site activities.
(f)
The director of planning and development may exempt development proposals on properties with one acre or less in area, or minor developments, from this requirement if through a site visit or other information presented the requirement for a site conditions analysis can be satisfied with other data and enforcing this requirement would be onerous given the development proposed.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.3; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-95. - Create public spaces and amenity areas.
(a)
Development should include public plazas, courtyards, and similar amenities or public assembly areas that are visible from the street and accessible from the business or other use. Such amenities should be scaled appropriately to the size and location of the project.
(b)
Outdoor spaces, which are particularly encouraged, include courtyards, patios, plazas, covered walkways (arcades and colonnades), passages, gardens, and trellised areas.
Outdoor Spaces. Fountains, play equipment, and artwork add visual interest and functions to amenity areas.

Secs. 117-96—117-118. - Reserved.
Subdivision III. - Grading

Sec. 117-119. - Site preparation, filling, and grading.
(a)
Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading design is not allowed. Grading on new project sites should blend with the contours of adjacent properties with minimum alteration of the natural topography necessary to accomplish the development.
(b)
The area under the drip line of all existing trees to be retained should be fenced prior to construction with orange plastic tree fencing material. Grading under the drip line of trees to be retained on site is prohibited so as to prevent soil compaction and significant root damage.
(c)
Proposed cut and fill slopes should be rounded off both horizontally and vertically.
(d)
Balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged.
(e)
No fill, removal, or modification of a riparian area should be approved unless there is no reasonable and feasible alternative, as determined by the county.
(f)
Preserve smooth flowing planes in the ground form; minimize steep slopes and avoid harsh, easily eroded banks.
Graded site adjacent to Kroger Shopping Center

This site has been graded level for development. Trees that may have contributed to the character of the development have not been saved. Grading should retain certain features of the natural topography, where possible.
Remax at Henry Grady Highway

•Grading practices on this site left a scarred, exposed cut adjacent to the site.

•Slopes should meet good engineering specifications (e.g., 2:1) and the exposed earth should be stabilized and covered to prevent erosion
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.2.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-120. - Drainage and erosion control.
(a)
All onsite drainage shall be collected and conveyed to an approved storm drainage system.
(b)
Consider minimizing runoff by clustering development on the least porous soils. Consider using infiltration devices. Evaluate and if appropriate install permeable pavements for overflow and employee parking areas where possible.
(c)
Natural on-site drainage patterns should be used where practicable. Detain runoff with open, natural drainage systems where possible.
(d)
Design man-made lakes and storm water ponds for maximum habitat value.
(e)
Best erosion control practices should be followed.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.2.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-121. - Retaining walls.
(a)
Tall, smooth faced concrete retaining walls are prohibited—walls visible from the right-of-way shall be faced with brick, stone, or other architectural treatment in the southern part of the SR 400 corridor and shall be composed of wood or similar earthen material in the northern part of the SR 400 corridor. The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping.
(b)
Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides.
Industrial Area, Dawson County

A highly visible, long, smooth, concrete retaining wall that should be finished with brick, stone, or other architectural finish, or otherwise screened from view from the public right-of-way.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.2.3; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-122. - Utilities.
(a)
Any utility installation proposed should be carefully assessed to insure against physical and visual damage to the landscape.
(b)
Utility easements should be coordinated and combined to minimize the number of additional easements and stream and road crossings needed.
(c)
All individual utilities serving developments shall be installed underground.
(d)
Utility easements shall be naturally landscaped or stabilized per BMPs.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.2.4; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-123. - Berms.
(a)
Berms should be used to provide visual and acoustical separation from vehicle traffic and incompatible land uses. The height and slope of a berm should vary to provide for visual interest and a more natural effect.
(b)
When used for screening, berms can be combined with a fence or planting. Berms should be constructed of good quality soil (for planting) on top of landfill, separated by an impervious layer of clay. Berms can be used for other purposes, besides screening, too, like recreational seating.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.2.5; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Secs. 117-124—117-144. - Reserved.
DIVISION 4. - PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION

Sec. 117-145. - Pedestrian systems must be provided.
(a)
All likely pedestrian routes should be identified in the design phase and provided for in the design process. These include linkages to individual buildings, neighboring properties, and access ways along public roads. Identifying pedestrian routes in advance will eliminate poor selection of landscape areas that become damaged due to pedestrian "short cuts."
(b)
All site facilities and amenities shall be accessible to people with disabilities in accordance with the applicable federal and state codes.
(c)
Pedestrian circulation should take precedence over vehicular circulation.
(d)
Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures or colors should be provided to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety. Brick pavers and other special paving materials and overhead features are encouraged to distinguish pedestrian walkway surfaces and areas.

DIVISION 5. - VEHICLE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION

Sec. 117-174. - Principal site access.
(a)
The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, should be considered in formulating and approving access plans.
(b)
A public frontage road shall be required parallel to Georgia 400.
(c)
Parcels should not be subdivided such that they each require individual access to a state highway. If the parcel has frontage on a secondary or frontage road, access points shall occur there and not on a highway.
(d)
The number of driveways shall be minimized, consistent with appropriate principles of highway and road access management and traffic engineering. Curb cuts (driveway accesses) will generally be restricted in number to one entrance and exit drive per development, if no other access is available.
(e)
Inter-parcel site access should be provided to adjacent properties.
(f)
Shared driveways between two parcels, at the property line, may be required.
(g)
New driveways should be sited away from or immediately opposite street intersections.
(h)
Provide adequate driveway length. Driveways should be long enough to allow adequate space for vehicles pulling off the road and stacking to enter the road.
(i)
The width of curb cuts shall be minimized, but shall always meet the requirements of emergency service vehicles. A wider curb cut may be required on a higher speed highway.
(j)
All elements of the site design shall accommodate access requirements of emergency vehicles and services.
(k)
All access points and curb cuts shall meet minimum rules and regulations for driveway and encroachment control of the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Dawson County Engineer, and the specifications provided in these guidelines.

Interparcel Access. Properties within the district must provide shared access with adjoining properties to facilitate frontage roads and connections between parcels. Shared parking arrangements are also encouraged.

The Dawson 400 shopping center's frontage on

the west side of GA. 400
• This driveway entrance to Dawson 400 shopping center has a narrow but landscaped center median to separate traffic flows (recommended).
• Note that it stops shorter than it should—although a median break may be needed to cross between the outlots shown in this photo, the median should have been extended another 150-200 feet to add landscaping, reduce impervious surface, and provide better access control.
• The McDonalds uses low-lying groundcover at the entrance (acceptable).
• To the right side of the photo, the shrubs are growing to a height that may impair visibility (though that is a minor consideration in this case of one way traffic).
• Ideally, a pedestrian crossing would be striped on the pavement to alert drivers to the possibility of pedestrians crossing the driveway.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 4.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-175. - Service functions.
(a)
Service functions (e.g., deliveries, maintenance activities) should be integrated into the circulation pattern in a manner which minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians.
(b)
Access for service vehicles, trash collection and storage areas should be located on alleys where alleys exist. When no alley exists, access should be provided to the rear or sides of buildings being served.
(c)
Larger commercial developments should have service and loading areas separate from main circulation and parking areas.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 4.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-176. - Off-street parking.
(a)
Any type of off-street parking configuration may be appropriate in the district, depending on site-specific development circumstances and objectives.
Types of Parking Configurations
Source: DeChiara and Koppleman 1984.
(b)
Driveway entrances should provide a 100 foot deep clear zone between the pavement of Georgia 400 and the first parking space. On any other state highway or county road, the clear zone should be at least 60 feet.
(c)
The driveway entry "throat" of large shopping center parking areas shall provide at least 40 feet of clear zone before a turning movement occurs to provide sufficient queuing room for cars entering off the street.
(d)
The visual impact and presence of vehicles should be minimized, preferably by siting parking areas to the rear or side of the property rather than along the principal street frontage, or if siting options are limited, screening parking areas with vegetation and berms from views exterior to the site.
(e)
Where a parking area fronts directly on a public street, a continuous opaque screen should be provided. Said screen should be a minimum height of two feet.
(f)
Parking for the handicapped shall be provided in accordance with applicable codes.

Secs. 117-177—117-205. - Reserved.
DIVISION 6. - LANDSCAPE

Sec. 117-206. - Generally.
(a)
Landscaped areas should be maximized within the viewshed of the highway and major streets.
(b)
All landscaping shall be continually maintained in a healthy and weed-free condition.
(c)
Tree and shrub planting should be grouped together to create strong accent points within the site plan unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
(d)
All plant materials should be sized so that the landscaping has an attractive appearance at the time of installation and a mature appearance within three years of planting.
(e)
Landscaping of the site upon completion of the development shall be consistent, in terms of plant location, species, and size, with the landscape plan for the development as approved by the planning and zoning director.
(f)
In certain prominent public areas, trees larger than the minimum may be required to create a strong design element.
(g)
All proposed shrubs except accent, color or ground cover planting should be a minimum of three gallon size. Shrubs and ground cover plants should be spaced close enough together to ensure an attractive and mature planting effect.
(h)
Landscaping should consider potential benefits of conserving energy in buildings. This can be done by recognizing the sun exposure on the site and providing appropriate tree species in advantageous locations: deciduous trees on the southern exposure, coniferous and broadleaf evergreen trees along the eastern and western exposures, and evergreens along the northern exposure.
(i)
Trees should be carefully selected and located where they will complement the building elevation and should not block all retail storefront signage from view.
(j)
Tree species should be selected with root growth habits that will not cause damage to sidewalks, or such tree species should be sited away from such hardscape areas.
(k)
Utility easements should be landscaped.
(l)
Dense landscaping and/or architectural treatments should be provided to screen unattractive views and features such as storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators, and other similar appurtenances.
(m)
Standards for transplanting should be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication, "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the "Manual for Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements.
(n)
Properties in the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor shall require a minimum landscaped coverage ratio of 20 percent or as required by the Dawson County Tree Ordinance, whichever is greater. Properties in the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor shall require a minimum landscaped coverage ratio of 30 percent or as required by the Dawson County Tree Ordinance, whichever is greater.
Chestatee State Bank, SR 53 east of Georgia 400
• Excellent landscaped area with variety of color and materials.
• Areas between the right-of-way and the parking area and/or building should be attractively landscaped.
• This is a very good example of a recommended practice for landscaping.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 5.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-207. - Buffers.
(a)
Buffers abutting residential districts.
(1)
Where commercial, industrial, office, or institutional development abuts an existing residential zoning district along a side or rear property line, minimum building setbacks and buffers shall be established according to the following table:
EXPAND
Zoning District Minimum Building Setback Along Side or Rear Yard Abutting a Residential
Zoning District Minimum Buffer Along Side or Rear Yard Abutting a Residential Zoning District
Office or institutional 40 feet 30 feet
Commercial 50 feet 40 feet
Industrial 60 feet 50 feet
  (2)
Buffers required by this section shall be planted and maintained with sufficient density and vegetative material to effectively screen the adjacent residential use from the subject activities. Existing vegetation may be considered sufficient in meeting this requirement if the area is delineated on the landscape or development plan as a tree save area, is protected by the tree protection devices as prescribed by these guidelines, and provides sufficient screening. If an existing tree save area is proposed as a buffer but such area does not provide sufficient screening, said tree save area shall be supplemented with additional plantings until screening is achieved.
This buffer requirement shall not apply to residential development that is developed as a part of a mixed-use development. If an existing residence lies within 100 feet of the property line adjoining the development, these buffer requirements shall apply unless written permission from the adjoining homeowners waiving these requirements is obtained.
(b)
Buffers along Georgia 400 right-of-way in north portion of corridor. Where a commercial, industrial, office, or institutional development abuts Georgia 400 in the north portion of the corridor, there shall be a minimum 30-foot-wide buffer (natural undisturbed, planted, or both) according to standards provided by these guidelines. The buffer shall provide a visual screen for at least 60 percent of the length of the property frontage.
(c)
Buffer standards.
EXPAND
Tree Type Height # of Rows & Spacing Center to Center Spacing Notes
Leyland Cypress 5-6 ft. 2/10-12' apart 10-12 ft. Requires pruning after 2 years
Hemlock, White Pine 8-10 ft. 2/8-10' apart 8-10 ft. Border line range
Virginia Pine 5-6 ft. 2/8-10' apart 8-10 ft.
Eleagnus 42 in. min. 2/8' apart 8 ft. Specify fruitland variety
Holly 6-8 ft. full 2/6-8' apart 6-8 ft. Specify Standard Burford, Nellie R Stevens, American or Greenleaf variety
Magnolia 6-8 ft. 2/8-10' apart 10-12 ft.
  The above specifications are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be applied rigidly. Furthermore, the number of rows of landscaping needed depends on the required width of the buffer. Vegetative material used in meeting the requirements for buffering should be of a height and mass that meets or exceeds the vegetative material suggested in the buffer standards table above.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 5.2; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-208. - Right-of-way frontage planting strips.
This section applies to all properties fronting a public street, whether a county road, local public frontage road, or state highway, including Georgia 400; provided, however, that the buffer requirement in the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor as specified in section 117-207(b) of these guidelines shall supersede the requirement for a right-of-way frontage-planting strip specified in this section.
(1)
Provide a planting strip along the entire frontage of all road rights-of-way with a minimum depth from the street right-of-way line into the interior of the property as follows:
EXPAND
Zoning District Depth of Strip Adjoining
Street Right-Of-Way
(feet)
Multi-Family Residential 20 feet
Commercial 10 feet
Industrial 10 feet
  (2)
Trees equivalent to at least one three inch caliper tree for every 30 linear feet of length shall be saved or planted in such strips (trees may be planted in groups rather than in a single line). Any trees placed between the right-of-way line and the construction area (the buildings, accessory uses, and parking area) may be considered to be in the planting strips. (See Detail 1—Frontage Planting Strips)
The Dawson 400 shopping center's frontage

on the west side of GA. 400

Some of the area shown is right-of-way. The grassed area is planted with a few trees, but the landscaping should be more dense and varied in high visibility areas of the corridor.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 5.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-209. - Tree protection.
(a)
When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, emphasis should be given to the preservation of significant trees, even isolated individual trees, over the retention of other trees. Nonsignificant trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site.
(b)
All tree save areas must be delineated on the landscape plan.
Chestatee State Bank, SR 53 east of Georgia 400
• The developer of this site made a conscious effort to save two trees. Tree save areas should be identified for significant trees, and such areas should be integrated into the development (i.e., the parking lot and building are designed around the tree save area).
• The tree save area on this site is another very good example of a recommended practice.
(c)
All buffers with existing trees should be delineated on plans as tree save areas, unless the applicant clearly demonstrates the need for disturbance.
(d)
Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees and are strongly recommended to guard against: soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching; wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment; and other activities such as chemical storage, etc. Tree protection devices should be installed as shown on the landscape plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all trees to be preserved. The location and installation of all tree protection devices should be installed prior to or concurrent with the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading.
(e)
Active tree protection should consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material (See Details 2 and 3—Active Tree Protection And Active Tree Protection/CRZ). Passive protection should consist of heavy mil plastic flagging of a bright color or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint sufficient to delineate the bounds of any tree protection or save areas.
(f)
All tree protection devices should be installed prior to or concurrent with any clearing, grubbing or grading. Tree protection devices need to remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development and may be subject to inspection by the county.
(g)
All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "Tree Protection Area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances (See Detail 4, Tree Protection Area Signage).

Sec. 117-210. - Parking lot landscaping.
(a)
Parking lots that face a street should be partially screened from the street by a low fence, wall, hedge, berm, or vegetated buffer. If a parking lot fronts an arterial or major collector street, and is of such a size that it dominates views from the fronting arterial/collector street and detracts from the overall streetscape and community appearance, then the parking lot should be screened or buffered with vegetation in its entirety from view along the fronting roadway(s) within the required right-of-way frontage planting strip (see section 117-208).
(b)
Landscape islands containing at least one overstory tree or two understory trees planted in each landscape island, shall be provided within parking areas with ten or more spaces and located in such a manner so as to divide and break up the expanse of parking area. Where required, one landscape island shall be located at the end of each row of parking spaces in the interior of the parking lot. In addition, one parking lot landscape island shall also be provided for every 150 linear feet of parking spaces, whether at the periphery or in the interior of the parking lot. Each landscape island shall be of sufficient shape and size so that one overstory tree or two understory trees will fit within the island. No portion of an island shall be less than three feet in width.
Each landscaped parking lot end island should have at least one overstory shade tree (shown), or two understory trees.

(c)
Landscaping should permit adequate sight distance for motorists and pedestrians entering and exiting a site and should not interfere with circulation patterns.
(d)
Curbing should be used at the edges of all planters and paving surfaces adjacent to vehicle circulation or parking areas. Vehicle overhang above or into landscape areas should be avoided unless wider or larger planting areas are provided to accommodate such instances. Landscaping should not be installed in areas of potential vehicle overhang.

Kroger Shopping Center at GA 400 and SR 53
A close look at the stripe-painted parking stall end island. This area should have been curbed and planted with a street tree and shrubs to soften the impervious environment. Also note that a painted end island serves little if any purpose of access direction. Motorists will drive across painted end islands and also park in them if the lot is full, thereby restricting the vision of motorists.
Shopping center, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell
Contrast this shopping center parking lot with those typically found in Dawson County. Rather than being simply painted, the parking lot end islands are curbed, striped, and filled with low-lying shrubs and some shade trees (recommended practices).
(e)
Painted end islands are ineffective and are not permitted.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 5.5; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-211. - Street trees.
(a)
In the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, street trees shall be installed in the public right-of-way of local streets for all development within nonresidential districts, subject to the approval of the county engineer.
(b)
Unless unusual circumstances prevail, all street trees or parking lot trees should be a minimum 15-gallon size. Street trees should normally be overstory, nonornamental, with a minimum three-inch caliper planted at 75-foot intervals. Sugar maple is the preferred street tree. In the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, street tree planting should strive to achieve the look of a manicured landscape by planting; toward this end, street trees may be grouped rather than spaced at regular intervals.
(c)
In lieu of street trees in the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, a right-of-way planting strip as required by these regulations should contain landscaping with a minimum caliper of three inches planted thirty feet on center.
Street Tree Planting Alternatives

(d)
In commercial areas, street trees along driveways and other access roads should be provided in addition to any proposed on-site landscaping to provide shading, visual enhancement, and continuity for the streetscape.
(e)
Street tree placement should include consideration for vehicle line of sight, entrance and exit curb cuts, street light and traffic control devices, and other site specific conditions. Street trees should be planted in a manner so that when they reach maturity they will not conflict with the visibility of signs.
(f)
Street trees should be pruned from grade to a minimum height of seven feet, six inches to allow visibility of buildings and sufficient vertical clearance.

(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 5.6; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-212. - Irrigation.
(a)
Water-intensive landscaping, such as turf grass, should be concentrated in areas of high visibility and use. The combined square footage of turf grass and decorative water (e.g. fountains, ponds, etc.) should be minimized to reduce water use and evapotranspiration.
(b)
Plant materials should be chosen which grow well in the localized climate and the given soil conditions without requiring excessive irrigation.
(c)
A plan for an automatic irrigation system should be provided as appropriate to insure that all plants receive adequate water for healthy growth. Irrigation systems should be provided for all planted areas that are under roof overhangs.

Secs. 117-213—117-232. - Reserved.
DIVISION 7. - ARCHITECTURE OF PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS

Sec. 117-233. - Generally.
(a)
Architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form, size, color, materials, and detailing.
(b)
The relationship of a building to its site, the public right-of-way and adjacent buildings is one of the most important components of successful urban design. The appearance of a building with respect to the street and other surroundings should be considered. If the building is much different in elevation from adjacent buildings and improvements, it will look out of place.
(c)
The designer should consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process:
(1)
Size (the relationship of the project to its site).
(2)
Scale (the relationship of the building to those around it).
(3)
Massing (the relationship of the building's various parts to each other).
(4)
Fenestration (the placement of windows and doors).
(5)
Rhythm (the relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections).
(6)
Setback (in relation to setback of immediate surroundings).
(7)
Materials (their compatibility with the historic district).
(8)
Context (the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings).
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-234. - Style.
(a)
Diversity of architectural design should be encouraged. "Theme" or stylized architecture which is characteristic of a particular historic period or trend is not encouraged, unless the existing building or site is historically important to the district or necessary for architectural harmony.
(b)
Multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-235. - Exterior materials.
(a)
All sides of a building may impact on its surroundings and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick and stone). As a general rule, front facades should be at least 80 percent brick and stone. Side facades should be at least fifty percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum requirement for primary materials and can consist entirely of secondary materials (e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only.
(b)
Exterior building materials on the primary structure should not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels.
(c)
The following types of building materials are highly prohibited: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-finish (noncolored) aluminum metal windows or door frames; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed plywood or particle board; and unplastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks.
(d)
All exterior facades of a structure located on an outparcel of a larger development should be considered primary facades and should employ architectural, site, and landscaping design elements which are integrated with and common to those used on the primary structure on the site. Common design elements should include colors and materials associated with the main structure or structures on the larger development.
(e)
Buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising should generally be discouraged, particularly where the proposed architecture is the result of a "corporate" or franchise style.
(f)
All vents, gutters, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits, etc., should be painted to match the color of the adjacent surface, unless being used expressly as a trim or accent element.
(g)
Soffits and other architectural elements visible to the public but not detailed on the plans should be finished in a material compatible with other exterior materials.
(h)
Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided.
(i)
Approved address numbers should be provided so that they are legible to the public from the street fronting the property.

• The rear side of the shopping center consists of a finished but monotonous wall. Although not visible to the general public unless they drive around to the rear of the shopping center, because of the lack of visual screening, adjacent residents will be able to view this wall.
• A horizontal accent stripe (a four—six foot wide stripe of different color) could help to reduce the monotonous color and even give an appearance of breaking up the continuous nature of the building wall.

Sec. 117-236. - Colors.
(a)
Facade colors should be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors should not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, provided that the width of the trim should not exceed four feet.
(b)
Building colors should be carefully chosen so that each building complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the "base" color (used on the majority of the building surface), "trim" color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and "accent" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.4; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-237. - Awnings and canopies.
(a)
The use of awnings on buildings are recommend so as to provide much needed protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior.
(b)
Awnings are recommended to be constructed with a durable frame covered by a canvas material. Awnings that are backlit through translucent materials may be acceptable but are not particularly encouraged. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs. Flameproof vinyl, canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be used.
(c)
Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors compliment the character of the structure or group of buildings.
(d)
Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.5; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-238. - Parapets.
Parapets should not be unbroken on any given side of a building for more than 100 feet. Parapets with greater distances should be articulated by indentations and modulations or by the additions of elements such as balustrades or other exterior members.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.6; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-239. - Cornices.
Cornice lines should be provided at the appropriate story of multi-story buildings, with architectural detailing compatible with the building design.

The continuous building facade is broken up by varying the facade setback. While the awning does not necessarily need to be continuous, the same type of awning found in the left side of the picture could have been extended along the portion of the facade that houses the shopping carts and coke machines (the section of building to the left of the Kroger sign).
An attractive and well articulated facade at the Dawson 400 shopping center
• The entrance to Dollar General is a distinct architectural feature.
• Pitched metal colored roof with cornice and brick facade are appropriate (recommended practices).
• Use of gables adds further architectural interest. However, the gabled facade on the Ace Hardware tenant space is "false" in the sense that it is not fully integrated into the pitched roof (note the exposed support pole, discouraged practice).
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.7; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-240. - Building facades.
(a)
Lengthy, featureless facades and building walls must be avoided. Large, flat, blank expanses on a facade are not acceptable and shall not be permitted.

A line of mature trees that almost entirely screens what would otherwise be a large, imposing side wall of a big box.

The rear side of this shopping center consists of a finished but monotonous wall. Trash receptacles are not enclosed.
(b)
The walls of buildings for office, institutional, commercial, and industrial use shall not extend more than 200 linear feet parallel to a street unless the front facade of the building is designed in a way that breaks up the building face into discrete architectural elements, which can be accomplished through the following:
(1)
Facade modulation: stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade.
(2)
Providing bay windows or repeating window patterns at regular intervals.
(3)
Providing a porch, patio, deck, covered entry to portions of the facade at the ground level, or in the case of buildings containing two or more story, balconies.
(4)
Changing the roofline by alternating dormers, or using stepped roofs, gables, or other roof elements.
(5)
Changing materials with the change in building plane.

The continuous building facade is broken up by varying the facade setback. While the awning does not necessarily need to be continuous, the same type of awning found in the left side of the picture could have been extended along the portion of the facade that houses the shopping carts and coke machines.

(Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-241. - Rooflines.
(a)
Roof planes should be varied to increase visual interest, and awnings above windows and entrances also help to provide visual interest.
(b)
Flat roofs with lengthy, nonarticulated walls are not acceptable.
(Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-242. - Outparcel development.
All exterior facades of a building located on an outparcel of a larger development shall be considered primary facades and should employ architectural, site, and landscaping design elements which are integrated with and common to those used on the primary structure on the site. Common design elements should include colors and materials associated with the main structure or structures on the larger development.

(a)
Trash enclosures shall be constructed of sturdy, durable, opaque materials (with trash receptacles screened from view) which are designed to be compatible with the project architecture and should use similar materials.
(b)
Trash enclosures should include adequate, accessible and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 7.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-259. - Mechanical equipment.
Rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment shall be screened from public view by building elements that are designed as an integral part of the building architecture.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 7.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-260. - Fences and walls.
(a)
All walls or fences fifty feet in length or longer, and four feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony though changes in plane, height, material or material texture or significant landscape massing.
(b)
Chain link fencing is discouraged. Use of special fencing design or materials should be discussed in cases where site security is paramount. If used, it should be vinyl coated (black or green colored vinyl encouraged).
(c)
Wooden fences should be painted or stained in an appropriate fashion and should not normally exceed a height of six feet.
(d)
The design of fences and walls should be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and should use similar materials.
Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136
Dumpster is screened with a solid wooden fence. Although screening of dumpsters is a recommended practice, its disrepair has resulted in the trash enclosure becoming an eyesore. The mesh screen over the top adds to the unkempt appearance. Trash collection areas must be kept clean from debris.
Northmeadow Office Park, Roswell
Recommended practice for screening dumpsters. The dumpster is enclosed on three sides with a solid decorative block wall, approximately eight feet high, that matches the primary building on the site. Doors allow for the complete enclosure of the receptacle area. The dumpster area is kept free from debris.

DIVISION 9. - COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 117-284. - Generally.
(a)
Commercial buildings should be compatible in scale, mass, and form with adjacent structures and the pattern of the surrounding area.
(b)
Efforts to coordinate the height of buildings and adjacent structures are encouraged. This is especially applicable where buildings are located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages such as window lines should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings.
(c)
Long or continuous wall planes should be avoided, particularly in the pedestrian activity areas, where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view.
(d)
Outside of pedestrian retail districts, building surfaces over two stories high or fifty feet in length should be relieved with changes of wall plane that provide strong shadow or visual interest.
Recesses and Projections
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-285. - Pedestrian retail districts.
(a)
The urban design objective of pedestrian retail districts is to create a high quality, pedestrian scale, and walkable areas with a traditional downtown atmosphere. Site and building design should address pedestrian needs and develop creative approaches to improving pedestrian interest, access and enjoyment.
Residential uses when mixed with commercial shops provide for active neighborhoods

(b)
Frontage design and signage locations should be coordinated with streetscape landscaping and street trees.
(c)
Building frontages should be active, with large nonreflective minimally tinted window openings at ground level.
(d)
The ground level front elevation of the building, outdoor eating, and activity areas should be placed on or near the front property line to maintain the continuity of the street edge, or in alignment with adjacent property frontage. Outdoor seating and dining areas that face onto the street are encouraged.
(e)
Street vendors are encouraged to add activity and interest to pedestrian areas.
(f)
Pedestrian open spaces such as covered walkways, courtyards and plazas are encouraged, as well as the development of open and attractive passageways between buildings and blocks.
(g)
Gaps created in the street wall by parking or other breaks in buildings should be minimized or eliminated.
(h)
The sequence of continuous pedestrian activity should not be interrupted. Blank walls and other "dead" or dull spaces at the street level should be avoided. Visually interesting activities at the sidewalk edge should be maintained and/or established to engage pedestrian interest.
(i)
When alley access is not possible, driveway openings along public streets should be minimized and should be located on the street with the least traffic volume.
(j)
Large structures should be designed to reduce their perceived height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smaller-scale components. The ratio of building height to right-of-way width should not exceed 1:3.

Sec. 117-287. - Convenience stores.
(a)
The on-site circulation pattern should include adequate driving space to maneuver vehicles around cars parked at the pumps, with special attention to the circulation of vehicles not involved in the purchase of fuel.
(b)
The amount of unrelieved pavement or asphalt area on the site should be limited through the use of landscaping, contrasting colors and banding or pathways of alternate paver material. Extensive expanses of single color concrete pavement should be avoided.
(c)
Building architecture should be designed to provide an attractive appearance which is compatible with the surrounding area. All architectural details should be related to an overall architectural theme.
(d)
Separate structures (canopy, carwash, cashiers booth, etc.) on the site should have consistent architectural detail and design elements to provide a cohesive project site. If a car wash is incorporated into the project, it should be well integrated into the design. The car wash opening should be sited so that it is not directly visible as the primary view from the street into the project site.
Exxon convenience store with gas pumps and car wash, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell
Recommended practices for building character into a convenience stores. The canopy over the gas pumps has brick support columns, a pitched, shingled roof and architectural detailing at the top of the structure. The car wash, located in the right part of the picture, has a brick facade and a pitched, shingled roof. Note that the materials for the canopy and car wash match the primary building on the site (convenience store). The developers have further softened the car wash building with second story windows.

Sec. 117-288. - Commercial display lots.
(a)
Where permitted, the outside storage or display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold, including manufactured home sales, should be visible along no more than 30 percent of the frontage of the property abutting the highway or major street, excluding approved driveway entrances and exits. Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way would not comply with this guideline.
(b)
Outdoor sales for department stores shall be limited to no more than ten percent of the total building footprint of the site, and should be partially screened from view.
Fleetwood Homes site on GA 400 North
The view to this site, which displays and sells manufactured homes, needs to be mostly screened. Recommended practice is to screen approximately 70 percent of the frontage with landscaping, leaving a significant view corridor on part of the frontage.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.5; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-289. - Fast food restaurants.
(a)
Franchise or corporate style architecture and/or highly contrasting color schemes are discouraged. If the restaurant will occupy a pad within a shopping center, the building should be designed to be consistent with the "theme" or design of the center.
(b)
Where drive-through elements are appropriate, they should be architecturally integrated into the building. Drive-through elements should not be located on the street side of the building or else should be heavily screened from view.
(c)
The site design should accommodate a logical and safe vehicle and pedestrian circulation pattern through the site. Circulation needs to allow for adequate length of queuing lines for drive-through elements which do not interfere with the on-site parking for patrons entering the restaurant, nor result in traffic queuing into the street.
(d)
Free-standing restaurant buildings should be designed and detailed consistently on all sides, including the rear and side elevations.
(e)
Outdoor seating areas, play equipment, and perimeter fencing should be of compatible and attractive design that is integrated with the main building architecture.
Waffle House under construction on the south side of SR 53 east of Georgia 400
The building facade is broken up with regard to color and is composed of attractive materials. However, a pitched roof would have helped this building avoid a look of "shoebox" architecture. It has now been completed with awnings.
Arby's at Dawson Forest Rd. and GA 400
Arby's, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell
The shorter side of the building faces the street with all parking and the drive-through facility located in the side and rear yards. The front yard is landscaped with grass and shrubs (recommended practices). The neon banding is not allowed.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.6; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-290. - Shopping centers.
(a)
A unified architectural design should be incorporated into each commercial center, including freestanding pad buildings. However, this should not discourage variations in the facades of multi-tenant facilities to enhance the perception of individual places of business. Any such variations should be achieved without creating an uncoordinated appearance or disrupting the harmony of architecture created for the entire development.
(b)
Outdoor gathering areas and public eating areas are encouraged.
(c)
On larger commercial sites, a portion of the total building area should be located at the street perimeter, preferably on a corner location. Such siting, together with substantial landscape treatment, reinforces and strengthens the streetscape and helps to screen off-street parking areas.
(d)
Shopping cart storage areas should be incorporated into the building design to provide a visual screen of carts from the parking area.
(e)
Recycling collection boxes should be relocated in remote parts of the site and screened.
Kroger Shopping Center at GA 400 and SR 53
The parking lot lacks landscape islands. Box type lighting is appropriate and not too tall. No landscape strip exists along the side lot line. Most shopping centers are designed with parking to meet peak demands that rarely occur.
Kroger Shopping Center at GA 400 and SR 53
A grass strip separates the convenience store from the main shopping center. From the human scale, the signs oriented to capture the interests of motorists on Ga. 400 are tall and large. Note the Taco Bell restaurant in the left of the picture has multiple franchise flags flying from the roof. Flags used for advertising purposes add unnecessary visual clutter to the landscape. Notice the painted parking end island in the foreground; this area should have been curbed and landscaped with a street tree and shrubs to soften the impervious environment.
Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136
Pitched roofs and use of brick in front building facades are recommended practices. However, architectural features lack harmony in the shopping center. Use of columns is appropriate. Note on the roof the metal protrusion that appears to have little if any practical function (it may be an extended fire wall) but unnecessarily introduces a distracting feature to the facade.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.7; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-291. - Urban activity centers.
(a)
Generally.
(1)
An urban activity center is a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development that combines retail, service, civic, office, institutional and multi-family and other residential uses and links the uses together by a highly connected pattern of streets, sidewalks, and shared open spaces. Activity centers allow for more intense clustering of land uses within nodes of new development to prevent the "stripping" out the entire corridor. For more information on recommendations for land use mix and design, see the land use element of the comprehensive plan (2005 amendment).
(2)
Activity centers must provide pedestrian access and vehicular and pedestrian interconnections between and among land uses within the development. Pedestrian facilities are expected to be included. Improved connections between key designation areas should be developed, such as between residential and commercial areas and connecting to parks and schools.
(b)
On-street parking. Except on primary frontage roads that provide access through the development, on-street parking may and should be provided on local streets and private access drives, especially within storefront retail areas, to reduce the need for parking lots and act as a buffer between automobiles and pedestrians.
(c)
Mix of uses. Mixed uses may be combined vertically within the same building or placed side by side on the same parcel, provided that they are in close proximity, planned as a unified and complementary whole, and functionally integrated to make use of shared vehicular and pedestrian access and parking areas.
(d)
Street design.
(1)
Streets, along with sidewalks and open spaces, should be designed as the main public spaces of activity centers. Activity centers should have a grid or modified grid of interconnected streets that disperse traffic and shall connect the activity center with surrounding development.
(2)
Streets within the development should have a design speed of 25 mph.
(e)
Height and mass. For activity centers, building heights should be greatest near the center of these developments and transition to lower heights outward toward the edge of the development. Buildings at the edge should be comparable in height and massing to the adjacent and nearby properties as well as the surrounding neighborhood.
Decrease Height and Mass in the Focus Area
(f)
Building placement. Buildings should be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, or along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the development review and approval process. The buildings should be generally placed so that the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk.
(g)
Storefront retail areas.
(1)
The ground level of multi-story buildings should contain retail or entertainment uses with direct entry from the street to provide pedestrian interest along sidewalks. Pedestrian interest can be enhanced with use of windows, entrances, and architectural details. Pedestrian signage, awnings, and ornamentation are encouraged.
(2)
Storefront windows should be transparent. Mirrored glass, faux windows or display casements are strongly discouraged.
(h)
Residential uses in activity centers. Some residences should be developed above the retail. A variety of housing types including single-family detached, town homes, multi-family units, and accessory dwellings should be created to provide diversity and a range of costs and types of housing in activity center developments.
(i)
Pedestrian scale.
(1)
Activity centers must be designed for the pedestrian as well as the automobile. The network of sidewalks, designated street crossings, and pathways shall be as complete as the one for automobiles and providing direct, convenient access. Sidewalks must be placed on both sides of streets within activity centers.
(2)
Street trees shall be planted along local streets and frontage roads to provide a distinct separation and buffer between pedestrians and moving automobiles.
(j)
Open spaces in activity centers. Activity centers shall provide useable open space in the form of urban spaces (plazas, greens, and pocket parks) and/or natural areas. Open spaces may include outdoor restaurant seating and playgrounds. Less formal open space uses such as walking or biking trails along natural streams, wetlands or other natural features should be used on the periphery of these developments.
(k)
Civic and institutional uses. Sites for churches, schools, community or club buildings, and similar public or semi-public facilities are encouraged to be provided, where appropriate, within activity centers. Uses such as schools, churches, and other institutions where provided should be part of an integrated site design and located and designed to minimize negative impacts.
(Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-292. - Business park development.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of these design guidelines is to ensure that new business parks are high quality developments that support job creation and economic expansion and at the same time respect the rural character and natural environmental features of the area. To accomplish these objectives, business parks should be developed in a campus-like setting consisting of attractive buildings, significant natural open space and formal landscaped areas. The appropriate uses for these business parks are suburban light manufacturing and assembly, scientific and research laboratories and corporate and general offices.
(b)
Perimeter buffer. Visual buffers consisting of existing vegetation supplemented by plantings and berms should be located along the periphery of business parks in accordance with overall landscaping requirements.
(c)
Outdoor storage and display.
(1)
Outdoor storage of materials or products is discouraged. Storage trailers or containers shall be located in designated areas at the rear of properties and screened from view. No outdoor processes should be employed in the operation of any business in the business park. Any waste and recycling receptacles shall be located within an enclosed structure at the side or rear of the building.
(2)
No outdoor display areas should be allowed except for seasonal display as specified in commercial display lots. Display areas should be located within screened areas, flex-space, or office buildings.
(d)
Landscaping. A minimum of ten percent of each developed subdivided tract within the business park should be devoted to landscaping. Large canopy street trees should be planted at 60 to 100 foot intervals along internal circulation roads.
(Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Secs. 117-293—117-313. - Reserved.
DIVISION 10. - INDUSTRIAL USES

Sec. 117-314. - Industrial districts.
Industrial districts are typically laid out in a gridiron of large blocks 1,000 to 2,000 feet long and 400 to 1,000 feet deep. Road rights-of-way should be 80-100 feet for major roads and 60 feet for secondary roads. Curves and radii must be large enough to accommodate large trailer trucks.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 9.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-315. - Screening of industrial and storage yards.
All areas devoted to the outside storage of vehicles, merchandise, and/or equipment not intended for display for public rent, lease, or sale, shall be screened from view from the right-of-way of the highway or county road along the entire property frontage, except in areas where access crossings have been approved. Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement. Loading areas should be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading shall be to the side of a building. Loading areas shall not be permitted within front yards.
J & M Laboratories building
The rear side of J & M Laboratories provides a visible view of the loading and storage area (discouraged). This view should be at least partially screened with landscaping and/or a fence/wall.
J & M Laboratories building
The J & M Laboratories building is attractive architecture with appropriate use of columns and vertical articulation (generally good practice for business and industrial parks). However, the building is large enough that the building walls should also be broken vertically with recesses or projections to interrupt the continuous plan of the facade. Notice the reflection of the trees in the windows—while the windows are attractive they should not be too reflective.
Gainesville Welding and Maintenance,

Henry Grady Highway
Chain link fencing with barbed wire top strands may be necessary for security purposes in light industrial zoning districts. If so, it should be coated with vinyl. The vehicle storage area is not screened (discouraged practice). Solid wooden fencing without barbed wire, with vegetated landscaping to soften the fencing, is a recommended practice. Inserting plastic or metal slats into the chain links for screening is not recommended because the inserts bend and break and are typically not very well maintained. The storage tank should be buried underground or at least screened.
Loading areas should be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading shall be to the side of a building. Loading areas shall not be permitted within front yards.

Secs. 117-316—117-333. - Reserved.
DIVISION 11. - MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 117-334. - Respect for adjacent residential neighborhoods; building facades; landscaping.
(a)
New multiple-family residential developments should respect the scale and character of the adjacent residential neighborhood through attention to views, building scale and orientation, proximity to adjacent uses, location of driveways, noise, lighting and landscape.
(b)
Building facades should be articulated by using color, arrangement, or change in materials to emphasize the facade elements. The planes of the exterior walls may be varied in height, depth or direction. Long facades should be designed with sufficient building articulation and landscaping to avoid a monotonous or overpowering institutional appearance.
(c)
Exterior site design and landscaping should provide functional recreational spaces and/or community site amenities. Exterior spaces should be designed to enhance the overall appearance and compatibility of such development by providing privacy, buffering and daylight, and to provide a pleasant transition to the street.
Dawson Forest Apartments

Pitched roofs and good use of recesses and projections
Pitched roofs and good use of Recesses and Projections

Split rail fence is acceptable.

Sidewalks and street trees would be a good addition.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, ch. 10; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-335. - Planned residential communities.
(a)
Planned residential communities may include golf-course master planned developments and exclusive (gated) neighborhoods. However, they may also provide a variety of dwelling types, including some combination of detached single-family (fee-simple or condominium), duplex, townhouse, multi-family dwellings and institutional (senior) living. Planned residential communities are therefore predominantly residential but not necessarily exclusively residential.
(b)
Where predominantly single-family residential uses are proposed, the gross density should not exceed the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, land use element, as described for the land use classification in which the property is located, as shown on the county's future land use plan map.

Secs. 117-336—117-356. - Reserved.
DIVISION 12. - EXTERIOR LIGHTING

Sec. 117-357. - Generally.
(a)
Exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material and colors.
(b)
Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site and the light source is shielded from direct offsite viewing. All outdoor light fixtures shall be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate uplighting, spill light, and glare.
(c)
Excessive illumination of signage, building or site should be avoided. Roof lighting, down-lighting washing the building walls, and illuminated awnings are all strongly discouraged.
(d)
Lighting limitations. The placement of street lights between buildings and the right-of-way of SR 400 in the northern portion of the SR 400 corridor are discouraged, except where they are necessary due to public safety concerns or in activity areas. It is intended that the northern part of the SR 400 corridor will remain a darker environment than the southern portion of the SR 400 corridor.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 11.1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-358. - Mounting poles and height.
(a)
Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. Use of low, bollard-type fixtures, 3—4 feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting.
Pedestrian Lighting
Source: Prouse 1992.
(b)
The mounting height of fixtures in smaller parking lots or service areas should not exceed twenty feet, with lower mounting heights encouraged, particularly where adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses.
(c)
The placement of light poles within raised curb planter areas is encouraged, but conflicts with parking lot trees which can obscure the lighting should be avoided.
Dawson 400 shopping center
• The shoebox style lighting appears appropriate, although the light poles are of two different colors because the phased addition of the shopping center was not consistent with an earlier design theme.
• The Ingles in the background is an excellent example of architectural articulation with gables and pitched roofs, unique second story window treatments, and effective awnings along the facade. Note also the strong variation in the roof line (all recommended architectural practices for shopping centers).
Mattress King, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell
Discouraged lighting practice. Flood lights installed at the roof line on the building are pointed toward the highway. At nightfall, motorists are likely to experience glare from these lights.
(d)
Luminaries should be rugged for the application, adapted to the environment, and designed to give years of trouble-free service. Quality luminaries should be selected because, even though there is a higher initial cost, they will be paid back quickly in reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability. Pole mounted "lantern style" or post-top" luminaries are preferred.
(e)
Cut-off fixtures required.
(1)
All luminaries used for outdoor lighting shall be full cutoff luminaries which do not emit any direct light above a horizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
Cut-Off Fixtures
(2)
Security lighting unless activated by motion sensor devices, shall also meet this requirement.
Security Lighting
(3)
Wallpacks are not permitted unless fully shielded.
Shielded Wallpacks Prohibited
Unshielded Wallpacks Prohibited
Shoebox-style (cut-off fixture) lighting is appropriate, although in this shopping center the light poles are of two different colors because the phased addition of the shopping center was not consistent with an earlier design theme.
Discouraged lighting practice. Flood lights installed at the roof line on the building are pointed toward the highway. At nightfall, motorists are likely to experience glare from these lights.

Sec. 117-359. - Types of lighting.
(a)
Light fixtures that provide canopy overlighting should be recessed into the canopy.
(b)
Yard lights shall be oriented downward; uplighting is not permitted.
(c)
Roof top lighting is strongly discouraged.
(d)
The use of excessive night-time security lighting is discouraged. Other security measures should instead be considered.
(e)
The use of laser source light for outdoor advertising or entertainment is prohibited.
(f)
High pressure sodium lighting is preferred over metal halide or other types of lighting for outdoor parking lots.
(Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 11.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3))
Sec. 117-360. - Architectural lighting.
(a)
Well-designed and distinctive lighting of building facades is one of the best ways to attract attention and make a favorable impression with a minimal investment. Building facade lighting can help enhance the intrinsic charm, beauty, and utility of any given setting. Architectural lighting may include outlining, floodlighting, spotlighting, or any applicable combination of these techniques.
(b)
The discrete lighting of a few key architectural features or details is preferred over uniform floodlighting of the entire building facade. Focal points can also be established through careful floodlighting of major buildings, with the lighting of secondary buildings keyed in turn to these focal points.
(c)
Highly polished surfaces such as glass, marble, glazed tile, glazed brick, porcelain enamel, and various metals can reflect the image of the light source. Designers should avoid lighting these reflective surfaces directly. Glass buildings usually cannot be lighted for nighttime viewing.

DIVISION 15. - GLOSSARY

Sec. 117-444. - Glossary.
Amenity. Aesthetic or other characteristics that increase a development's desirability to a community or its marketability to the public. Amenities may differ from development to development but may include such things as recreational facilities, pedestrian plazas, views, streetscape improvements, special landscaping, or attractive site design.
Anchor tenant. The major store or stores within a shopping center.
Appearance. The outward aspect that is visible to the public.
Appropriate. Fitting to the context of a site, neighborhood or community.
Arcade, entry. An arcade that provides public access to a building entrance, retail space, and/or public space.
Architectural concept. The basic aesthetic idea of a structure, or group of structures, including the site, signs, buildings and landscape development that produces the architectural character.
Architectural features. Ornamental or decorative features attached to or protruding from an exterior wall, including cornices, eaves, gutters, belt courses, sills, lintels, bay windows, chimneys, and decorative ornaments.
Architectural recesses. Portions of a building wall at street level which are set back from the street line so as to create articulation of the building wall and/or to provide space for windows or doors.
Architecture. The art and science of designing and constructing buildings adapted to their purposes, one of which is beauty.
Attractive. Having qualities that arouse satisfaction and pleasure in numerous, but not necessarily all, observers.
Awning. A hood or cover that forms a roof-like structure, often of fabric, metal, or glass, designed and intended for the protection from the weather or as a decorative embellishment, and which projects from the wall or roof of a structure over a window, walk, door, or the like. Awnings may be retractable but are most often fixed with a rigid frame.
Awning, internally illuminated. A fixed awning covered with a translucent membrane that is, in whole or part, illuminated by light passing through the membrane from within the structure.
Balustrade. A railing consisting of a handrail or balusters.
Bollards. Luminaries having the appearance of a short, thick post, used for walkway and grounds lighting. The optical components are usually top mounted.
Brightness. The subjective sensation to measured luminance's. Brightness is affected by the environment in which the luminaire resides and is also a function of average luminance, luminous intensity, mounting height, beam angle, and background luminance. As the background luminance of a scene gets higher, the apparent brightness of a luminaire becomes lower. Brightness is difficult if not impossible to measure. However, higher luminous intensities generally mean higher brightness.
Buffer. A strip of land along a property, lease line, or other border, never less than 15 feet, between one use and another or between an environmentally sensitive area and another use, to screen, separate and shield one use area from another and obstruct noise, illumination, visual, and other incompatibilities or nuisances. A buffer may be a natural, undisturbed area of trees and undergrowth that provides opaque or near opaque screening. A buffer, where sparsely vegetated, is replanted with trees and shrubs to enhance its screening functions to opaque or near opaque conditions. A fence or wall can be included within a buffer but a fence or wall in itself does not constitute a buffer.
Build-to line. An alignment established a certain distance from the curb or right-of-way line to a line along which a building or buildings shall be built.
Building bulk. The visual and physical mass of a building.
Built environment. The elements of the environment that are generally built or made by people as contrasted with natural processes.
Caliper. A forest standard of tree trunk measurement for understory or replacement trees.
Canopy. A roof-like structure, supported by a building and/or columns, poles, or braces extending from the ground, including an awning, that projects from the wall of a building over a sidewalk, driveway, entry, window, or similar area, or which may be freestanding.
Character. The nature of a building.
Cohesiveness. Unity of composition among elements of a structure or among structures, and their landscape development.
Common area. Land within a development, not individually owned or dedicated to the public, and designed for the common usage of the development. These areas include green open spaces and yards and may include pedestrian walkways and complimentary structures and improvements for the enjoyment of residents of the development.
