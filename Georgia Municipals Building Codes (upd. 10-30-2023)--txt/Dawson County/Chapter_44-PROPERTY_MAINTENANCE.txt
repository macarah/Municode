Sec. 44-2. - Purposes.
(a)
The Board of Commissioners of Dawson County finds that there are a number of residential and nonresidential properties in Dawson County that are poorly maintained and neglected by their owners. These properties adversely affect citizens who own or occupy nearby buildings and dwellings by lowering property values and rental values and by creating public health and safety problems.
(b)
These adverse effects also increase the incidence of illegal habitation, vandalism, criminal activity, and fire. The board of commissioners finds that the elimination and prevention of these conditions is necessary and is in the best interest of the county and its citizens.
(c)
Additionally, the board of commissioners finds that in Dawson County there is the existence or occupancy of dwellings or other buildings or structures which are unfit for human habitation, or for commercial, industrial, or business occupancy or use, and are inimical to the welfare and are dangerous and injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Dawson County. The board of commissioners finds that it is necessary and in the best interest of the county and its citizens to utilize the authority granted to the county by O.C.G.A. ยง 41-2-7, et seq., to adopt this ordinance and to repair, close, seize, or demolish and remove unfit dwellings or structures.
