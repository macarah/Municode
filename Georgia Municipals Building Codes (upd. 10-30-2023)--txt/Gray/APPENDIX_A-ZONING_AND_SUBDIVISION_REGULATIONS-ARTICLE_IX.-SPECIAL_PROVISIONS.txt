Section 90. - Cluster development.
90.1. Purpose. The purpose of cluster development is to provide an option to traditional subdivision design that will:
(a)
Result in improved living environments;
(b)
Promote more economic and functional subdivision design;
(c)
Preserve open space and sensitive natural areas;
(d)
Encourage ingenuity and originality in subdivision design;
(e)
Encourage a pleasing mix of dwelling unit types and living arrangements within a single development;
(f)
Encourage the development of improved recreational facilities in residential developments;
(g)
Reduce the cost of infrastructure needed to serve new developments; and
(h)
Preserve and enhance the character of established residential neighborhoods.
To achieve these objectives, an applicant for a permit to construct a residential development within the R-1, R-1A, and R-2 residential zones may elect, with the written consent of the planning commission, to submit a subdivision plan utilizing the cluster development option, subject to the provisions set forth in this section. The planning commission may permit, upon determination that the proposed development complies with all requirements of this section, variations in lot area, setbacks, and other dimensional requirements, and a variety of residential building types as necessary to ensure that the cluster development design will achieve the objectives identified above.
90.2. Procedures. The procedures and submission requirements for approval of a cluster development shall be the same as those for a standard subdivision as specified in article XII of this ordinance, except as specified below.
90.2.1. Prior to submission of an application for subdivision approval, the applicant shall request written consent to prepare a subdivision plat using the cluster development option from the planning commission at a regular or special meeting. Such request must be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least ten days prior to a regularly scheduled planning commission meeting. The planning commission shall act on the request on or before the second regularly scheduled meeting following the date of submission, unless the request includes a conceptual plan review as specified in section 90.2.3. When conceptual plan review is requested or required, the planning commission shall act on the letter of consent request within 45 days of the meeting at which the planning commission receives the request.
90.2.2. The planning commission's letter of consent shall, at a minimum, reiterate the objectives of the cluster development option and refer the applicant to the specific section of the land development ordinance containing the required standards for cluster development. A letter of consent shall not constitute nor imply planning commission approval of the development plan.
90.2.3. The prospective applicant also may submit with the written cluster development option request a conceptual plan of the proposed development in order to receive feedback from the planning commission that will help the applicant prepare a preliminary plat. No formal application form or charge shall be required for conceptual plan review. Any recommendations resulting from this review shall be included in the letter of consent. This conceptual plan review procedure shall supersede the preapplication review provisions in section 122 with respect to cluster developments only.
90.2.4. All applicants intending to request a density bonus in accordance with section 90.3.2 below shall submit a conceptual plan for planning commission review. No applicant may request a density bonus from the city council without first obtaining a recommendation to do so from the planning commission. Where the planning commission determines that a density bonus is appropriate to the proposed development plan, such recommendation shall be included in the letter of consent.
90.2.5. An applicant may request that a portion or portions of the proposed development site be rezoned to any zoning district within which the cluster development option is permitted. Any request for a rezoning of a cluster development site shall be processed in the customary manner once the applicant has received written consent from the council to prepare a subdivision plat utilizing the cluster development option. If the rezoning is approved by the city council and the development final plat is subsequently approved by the council, the applicant must commence construction within one year of the date of final plat approval or the mayor and council may initiate action to rezone the property. An applicant may demonstrate that construction has commenced by completing at least 50 percent of all grading and site preparation work in compliance with the approved final plat.
90.3. General requirements. All cluster developments shall comply with the following requirements:
90.3.1. Development density. The total number of units allowed in a cluster development shall be ten percent more than the number allowed on the property by the standard minimum lot size for the applicable zoning district, except as provided in section 90.3.2 of this ordinance. All units built in a cluster development shall be served by public sewer. An increase in development densities on a portion or portions of the property may be allowed through a reduction in required lot sizes, as long as at least ten percent of the development site is preserved as common open space in satisfaction of all requirements specified in section 90.3.5 of this ordinance.
To calculate the number of dwelling units/lots that may be created within a cluster development, multiply the total number of acres in the proposed development site by the factor for the desired type of dwelling and applicable zoning district listed in the following table. The resulting dwelling unit total must be rounded to the nearest whole number.
EXPAND
Maximum Permitted Dwelling Units
Per Acre Within Cluster Developments
Zoning District No Density Bonus Ten Percent Density Bonus
R-1 residential
single-family 2.1296 2.3426
R-1A residential
single-family 3.1944 3.5138
R-2 residential
single-family 3.4226 3.7648
two-family (duplex) 4.7916 5.2708
  90.3.2. Density bonus. An applicant, having received written consent from the planning commission to prepare a preliminary plat using the cluster development option, also may request written approval from the city council for an increase in permissible development density of not more than ten percent. City council approval of the requested density bonus must be received prior to the submission of a preliminary plat as required in section 123 of this ordinance. The city council may approve a density bonus, if the proposed cluster development will result in substantial recreational improvements to the developable portions of the common open space or in the provision of improved sidewalks within public rights-of-way in the development. Substantial recreational improvements may include, but not be limited to:
(a)
Jogging/walking trails with exercise stations, benches, and landscaping where appropriate;
(b)
Ballfields, tennis courts, or basketball courts;
(c)
Landscaped picnic areas with barbecue pits, picnic tables, and, if appropriate, shelters;
(d)
A swimming pool with protective fences;
(e)
A clubhouse or other common indoor activity center; or
(f)
Sidewalks within street rights-of-way in compliance with the requirements of section 147.
Any proposed open space improvements or park shall include provisions for regular maintenance as specified in section 90.3.13, unless the applicant has received approval from the city council to dedicate the proposed recreational area to the City of Gray.
In determining the amount of density bonus to be extended for the optional improvements specified above, the city council may consider:
(a)
The market population (age and socioeconomic structure) of the proposed development and the extent to which the proposed improvements will satisfy the recreational needs of that population;
(b)
The size (number of units) of the proposed development and its distance from existing public recreational facilities;
(c)
The extent to which the proposed improvements will lessen any potential impacts to neighboring developments or make the development more compatible with the surrounding area;
(d)
The estimated cost of the proposed open space improvements and the extent to which the benefits to the applicant resulting from a density bonus will compensate for the cost of the improvements; and
(e)
The extent to which the proposed improvements will further the stated goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan.
90.3.3. Minimum size of cluster developments. To be proposed as a cluster development, the subdivision site must contain at least ten contiguous acres of land area, unless the proposed development is determined by the planning commission to be a logical extension of an existing or approved development and will be designed to be compatible with said adjoining development. Such a determination shall be included in the planning commission's letter of consent.
90.3.4. Types of dwellings. A cluster development may consist of a mix of any residential dwelling unit types permitted within the applicable zoning district, except for multifamily buildings.
90.3.5. Open space and parks. Every cluster development shall contain open spaces equal to at least ten percent of the total area of the cluster development. All open space shall be integrated into the development design such that it enhances the privacy and convenience of individual homes within the development. Open space areas should be designed to maximize access from individual properties within the development. In addition, open space areas also shall comply with the following specific requirements:
90.3.5.1. At no point shall an open space area be less than 20 feet in width.
90.3.5.2. At least 50 percent of the lands designated as open space shall consist of developable land area with slopes not exceeding eight percent. However, where the applicant has proposed to improve portions of the open space as a park, the planning commission may allow certain floodplain areas or slopes in excess of eight percent to be considered part of the 50 percent developable land area requirement, when such inclusion would not conflict with the proposed recreational uses or endanger the public.
90.3.5.3. Parks and/or recreational improvements (except for sidewalk improvements) may be proposed only in open space areas that are designated as developable land area by the planning commission. Only open space uses may be proposed within areas that do not qualify as developable land area.
90.3.5.4. Common open space shall not include public or private road rights-of-way, driveways, private yards or patios, parking areas, utility easements containing above ground utilities (where such facilities would interfere with the intended uses of the open space), nor other areas designed for nonrecreational or non-open space uses.
90.3.5.5. Where unique or special natural features exist on the development site, such resources should be included within the designated open space area. If the planning commission determines that any unique or special natural features represent significant local resources, the applicant may be required to include them within the designated open space areas.
90.3.5.6. Where an applicant proposes to construct a park within a cluster development, the planning commission may lessen requirements for individual property access to create sufficient open space mass to accommodate the proposed recreational improvements, as long as adequate public access is provided for the residents of the development.
90.3.5.7. All proposed recreational improvements to open space areas shall be designed to afford equal access to physically disabled persons.
90.3.5.8. No parks or improved recreational areas shall be located along the boundary of the development, where said boundary adjoins an established residential area, unless the proposed cluster development is determined by the planning commission to be an extension of the neighboring residential area. A proposed park may be located along any property boundary of the development site that borders a road, stream, or nonresidential use.
90.3.6. Buffers. All cluster developments should be designed to enhance surrounding neighborhoods and minimize external impacts to adjoining residential areas. The planning commission may require a buffer strip of at least 20 feet in width along any or all property boundaries which adjoin existing residential areas or nonresidential uses. Any required buffer shall be permanently vegetated and maintained as common open space. Portions of the development that do not contain developable land area may be used to satisfy the buffer requirement, however, no designated buffer strip may be improved in order to acquire a density bonus.
If the planning commission determines that the aforementioned buffer requirements constitute excessive constraints on the cluster design or are otherwise inappropriate for the specific development site, then the applicant may be allowed to place house lots along the development boundary, provided the proposed lots satisfy the standard dimensional requirements of the applicable zoning district, and that the houses constructed on the border lots are of a similar unit type as the existing homes adjoining the proposed cluster development.
90.3.7. Water and sewer. All units in a cluster development must be served by municipal water and sewer.
90.3.8. Underground utilities. All units in a cluster development shall be served by underground utilities.
90.3.9. Emergency services. All cluster developments shall be designed to facilitate access for emergency services. Where questions regarding emergency service access arise during development review, the planning commission may request that the applicant receive a written statement from the Gray Fire Chief and/or the Gray Police Chief stating that the proposed development, as designed, will not create an undue burden on the provision of emergency services.
90.3.10. Streets. All cluster developments must comply with all street design requirements of this ordinance. No reduction in street dimensional standards shall be authorized by the planning commission.
90.3.11. Entrance ways. To facilitate emergency vehicle access, each cluster development consisting of more than 40 units shall provide at least two development entrance ways separated by not less than 200 feet on center line. Additional development entrances may be proposed at the discretion of the applicant, however no development consisting of less than 200 units shall have more than four entrance ways.
90.3.12. Drainage. The planning commission may require the construction of storm water detention or retention areas within cluster developments to prevent runoff and erosion and sedimentation impacts on neighboring developments. Where such drainage improvements are required, adequate maintenance provisions shall be included in the restrictive covenants, association bylaws, or rules for the development as prescribed in section 90.3.13. Any stormwater detention or retention areas shall be considered open spaces, however they must be maintained in a natural or vegetated state.
90.3.13. Maintenance of common areas. Every cluster development shall include provisions for maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership as prescribed below.
No lot or dwelling unit in a development containing open space shall be sold until a corporation, association, property owner's group, or similar entity has been formed with the right to assess all the properties which are jointly owned with interests in the common areas and facilities in the entire development or in the tract which is a part of the entire development to meet the expense of such entity, and with authority to control, and the duty to regularly maintain all of said mutually available features of the development or tract portion thereof. In addition, the homeowner's association bylaws or rules shall contain provisions authorizing the local government to maintain
said open space at the association's expense and upon 15 days advance written notice to the association, if the association has not properly maintained any or all open space entrusted to it. Such entity shall operate under recorded conditions, covenants and restrictions which may include compulsory memberships of all owners of lots and/or dwelling units, and flexibility of assessments to meet changing costs of maintenance, repairs, and services. The developer shall submit evidence of compliance with these requirements to the planning commission. This condition shall not apply to land dedicated to the city for public purposes.
90.3.14. Pedestrian access. Where a proposed cluster development contains multiple improved recreational facilities, adequate provision for safe pedestrian access to such facilities and open space areas shall be provided. Furthermore, any proposed or required sidewalks within a cluster development shall tie into existing public sidewalks that adjoin the proposed development.
90.3.15. Compliance with state laws. All units within a cluster development under common ownership shall satisfy all applicable regulations of the "Georgia Condominium Act" (O.C.G.A. § 85.16E).
90.4. Dimensional requirements. Cluster developments shall be constructed in accordance with the preliminary subdivision or site plan as approved by the planning commission. Within a cluster development, the planning commission may authorize the following changes to the dimensional requirements contained in article IX.
90.4.1. Lot size reductions. The minimum lot areas specified in section 90 of this ordinance for lots with public sewer access may be reduced in cluster developments as specified below for the applicable zoning district:

(6)
Visual impact:
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.

c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping:
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
c.
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
d.
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the governing authority to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section.
e.
The governing authority may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the governing authority.
(8)
Maintenance impacts: Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses:
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage.

(10)
Lot size and setbacks:
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof of a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1.1 setback ratio (example: ten foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(11)
Change of ownership: Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, antenna or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the governing authority of the transaction in writing within 30 days.
(12)
