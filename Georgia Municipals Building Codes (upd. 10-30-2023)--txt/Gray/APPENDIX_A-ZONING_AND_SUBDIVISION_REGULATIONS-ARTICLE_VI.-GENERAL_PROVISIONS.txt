ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 61. - Nonconforming buildings and uses.
Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
61.1. Incompatibility of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming use of structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located. Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without approval of the planning commission, and then only to a use which, in the opinion of the planning commission, is of the same or a more conforming nature.
61.2. Avoidance of undue hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
61.3. Single nonconforming lots of record. A single lot of record which does not meet the requirements for area or width, or both that are applicable in the district existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance may be used or sold for the erection of those buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out the permitted uses in that district, provided:
61.31. Yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located unless a variance has been granted.
61.32. Variance for yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of zoning appeals as provided for in section 114.
61.33. Locational requirements of accessory buildings and uses are met as provided for in section 93.1.
61.34. Parking space requirements for all districts as provided for in section 62.2.
61.35. In residential districts, buildings shall be limited to single-family detached dwellings.
61.36. Said lot cannot be combined with an adjoining undeveloped lot to create a single conforming lot for purposes of development.
61.4. Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two or more undeveloped lots or a combination of undeveloped lots and portions of undeveloped lots with contiguous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance. A lot is considered undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it.
61.5. Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the time of adoption of this ordinance, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
61.51. No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance;
61.52. No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance;
61.53. If any such nonconforming uses of land are voluntarily discontinued for a period of more than 60 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located; and
61.54. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
61.6. Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
61.61. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. No such alterations or enlargement shall be, in and of itself, nonconforming.
61.62. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current replacement value, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
61.63. Should such structure be voluntarily moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which located after it is removed.
61.64. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the replacement, addition to or improvement of a nonconforming manufactured or mobile home, provided that any replacement home meets all applicable federal, state, and local requirements, or said addition or improvement shall cause the house to more closely resemble a site-built structure, thus decreasing the appearance of nonconformity. Any replacement of a nonconforming manufactured or mobile home must be completed within 60 days of the removal of the nonconforming manufactured or mobile home.
61.7. Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful; subject to the following provisions:
61.71. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, voluntarily moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
61.72. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
61.73. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
61.74. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than 60 days (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
61.75. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current replacement value, shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
61.8. Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs including remodeling, or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
Section 62. - Off-street automobile parking.
Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this ordinance.
62.1. General requirements. For the purpose of this ordinance the following general requirements are specified:
62.11. The term "off-street parking space" shall mean a space at least nine feet wide and 20 feet in length with a minimum net area of 180 square feet, excluding area for egress and ingress and maneuverability of vehicles. In parking areas containing ten or more total parking spaces, no more than 20 percent of the parking spaces may be at least 7Â½ feet wide and 15 feet in length. These smaller spaces shall be prominently designated as reserved for small or compact cars.
62.12. If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the board of zoning appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of such principal use. Such vehicle parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
62.13. The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to another use at the same time, except that portion of the parking space required for existing church whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at nights or on Sundays.
62.14. Area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, except where equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the board of zoning appeals.
62.15. Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this ordinance in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use.
62.2. Parking space requirements for all districts. Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal in or to at least the minimum requirements for the specific land use set forth.
