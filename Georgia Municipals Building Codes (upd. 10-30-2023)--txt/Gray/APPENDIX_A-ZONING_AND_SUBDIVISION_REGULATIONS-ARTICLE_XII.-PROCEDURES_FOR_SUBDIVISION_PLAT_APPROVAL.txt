ARTICLE XII. - PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL

Section 121. - Platting authority.
The mayor and city council of Gray shall be the official platting authority.
(Ord. of 6-3-1996; Ord. of 5-4-1998(2))
Section 122. - Preapplication review.
Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land within the jurisdiction of the commission is proposed, the subdivider should consult early and informally with the zoning enforcement officer for advice and assistance. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. The zoning enforcement officer shall return within 15 days the submitted sketch plans to the subdivider and shall inform the subdivider where the plans do not comply with the regulations set forth in this ordinance. No fee shall be charged for the preapplication review and no formal application shall be required.
Section 123. - Procedure for preliminary plat approval.
Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedure:
123.1. Application for preliminary plat approval. Following the preapplication review of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer a complete application for review and approval of a preliminary plat.
123.11. If the property being subdivided does not abut any part of the state highway system, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer an application for approval of preliminary plat, and four copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 124 herein. The mayor and city council of Gray shall act on the preliminary plat at its next regular meeting, no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning enforcement officer.
123.12. If the property being subdivided abuts any part of the state highway system, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer an application for approval of preliminary plat and seven copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 124 herein. The zoning enforcement officer shall forward three copies of the preliminary plat and other documents to the Georgia Department of Transportation District Office for review and approval, or disapproval, in accordance with the O.C.G.A. ยง 32-6-151. The commission shall act on the preliminary plat at its next regular meeting no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning enforcement officer or at the next regular meeting of the mayor and city council of Gray no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision of the Georgia Department of Transportation by the zoning enforcement officer, whichever is later. Applications for preliminary plat approval for subdivisions of property abutting the state highway system that do not include all of the above items shall not be considered complete. Approval of a subdivision plat does not relieve the subdivider of the requirement to obtain a commercial driveway permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation.
123.2. Georgia Department of Transportation recommendations. In accordance with O.C.G.A. ยง 32-6-151, the zoning enforcement officer shall submit three copies of the preliminary plat to the Georgia Department of Transportation if the proposed subdivision includes or abuts on any part of the state highway system. The department of transportation, within 30 days of receipt of the plat, shall recommend approval or disapproval and note its recommendation on the copy to be returned to the zoning enforcement officer. Failure of the department of transportation to act within this 30-day period shall constitute a recommendation for approval. If the plat is recommended for disapproval, the reasons for disapproval and requirements for approval shall be given to the zoning enforcement officer in writing; but such recommendations shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the mayor and city council of Gray. Approval of a subdivision plat does not relieve the subdivider of the requirement to obtain a commercial driveway permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation.
123.3. Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of hearing shall be sent by registered mail to the address of the subdivider not less than five days before the date fixed therefore. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning enforcement officer to send the said notice.
123.4. Review of preliminary plat. The zoning enforcement officer shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations of this ordinance and report his findings and recommendations to the commission, which shall afford a hearing on the preliminary plat.
123.41. Preliminary approval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material, the commission may express preliminary approval noting the conditions of such approval on four copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider, one copy to the Jones County Health Department and one copy to the office of the building inspector for the council and one copy to be added to the records of the commission. Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat. It indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the final plat.
123.42. Expiration time. Preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further effect 12 months from the date of the preliminary approval unless the time is extended by the commission.
123.43. Disapproval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material, the commission may find reasons detrimental to the public safety, health, and general welfare, or in conflict with adopted plans of the commission which required the disapproval of the preliminary plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be made on two copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider and one copy being added to the records of the commission. The applicant may reapply for preliminary plat approval in accordance with section 123.1 herein.
123.44. Automatic approval. Failure of the commission to act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after submission thereof, without due cause, shall be deemed to be approval of the plat and a certificate of preliminary approval shall be issued by the commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time.
Section 124. - Preliminary plat specifications.
124.1. Scale. The preliminary plat shall be clearly legibly drawn at a scale not smaller than 200 feet to one inch.
124.2. Sheet size. Sheet size shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches. If the complete plat cannot be shown on sheet of this size, it may be shown on more than one sheet with an index map on a separate sheet of a reduced scale.
124.3. Ground elevations. The preliminary plat shall show ground elevations, based on the datum plane of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.
124.31. For land that slopes less than approximately two percent, spot elevations shall be shown at all breaks in grade, along all drainage channels or swales, and at selected points not more than 100 feet apart in all directions.
124.32. For land that slopes more than approximately two percent, contours shall be shown with an interval of not more than five feet if the ground slope is regular or with an interval of not more than two feet if the ground slope is irregular.
124.33. A tie to one or more bench marks shall be shown.
124.34. An exception to above requirements for showing ground elevation is a preliminary plat of a subdivision located in any subdivision with the average size of the lots being greater than one acre. A preliminary plat of such subdivisions shall show only the location of streams (both perennial and intermittent); direction of flow of these streams; any areas subject to flooding; and selected spot elevations.

"In that all the requirements of preliminary approval having been fulfilled, this subdivision plat was given preliminary approval by the mayor and city council of Gray on _____, 19[20]___."
