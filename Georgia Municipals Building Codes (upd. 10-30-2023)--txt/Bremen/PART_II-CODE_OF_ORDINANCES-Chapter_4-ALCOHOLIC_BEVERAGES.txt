ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Purpose and authority to regulate alcoholic beverages in city.
(a)
This chapter has been enacted in furtherance of the police powers of the city and in accordance with a plan designed for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health and general welfare of the community by establishing reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages. It is intended to protect and preserve schools and places of worship; to give effect to existing land use and to preserve residential areas, with reasonable considerations, among others, to the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses; to minimize congestion in the roads and streets; to promote economic and development activity within those areas of the city that have the existing road structure and sewerage capacity to handle additional and larger concentrations of lodging and dining facilities; and with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining stability of neighborhood and property values, it is intended to protect against the evils of concentration of ownership or control of the retail outlets for alcoholic beverages and to prevent persons of ill repute from controlling the retail alcoholic beverage industry within the boundaries of the city.
(b)
The provisions of this chapter are ordained under and by virtue of the authority granted by Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-1 et seq. to adopt all reasonable rules and regulations as may fall within the police powers of the municipality to regulate and impose taxes on any such business
(c)
The provisions of this chapter regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages and nudity on the premises are ordained by virtue of the authority granted by the constitution and laws of the United States and State of Georgia, for the predominate goal of combating pernicious secondary effects as most recently delineated by the Supreme Court of Georgia in its decisions of Gravely v. Bacon, and S.J.T., Inc. v. Richmond County, and Goldrush II, v. City of Marietta, in order to avoid the effects of criminal interests and negative effects on the community by the decreased safety and welfare of the city's citizens, the hindering of commercial growth in the city, and the deterioration of the city's economic base.
