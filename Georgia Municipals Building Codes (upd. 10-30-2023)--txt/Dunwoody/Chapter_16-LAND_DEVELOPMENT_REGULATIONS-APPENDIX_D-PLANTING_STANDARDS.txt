APPENDIX D - PLANTING STANDARDS
(1)
After selecting a suitable location, mark out a planting area that is five times the diameter of the planting ball. Use a rototiller or shovel to loosen and mix the soil in this entire area to a depth of about 12 inches.
(2)
In the center of the prepared area, dig a shallow hole to set the tree or shrub. The hold should allow the root ball to sit on solid ground rather than loose soil. Once the ball is set the hole, its upper surface should be level with the existing soil.
(3)
After the tree is properly situated, cut and remove the rope or wires holding the burlap in place and securing any part of the tree.
(4)
Backfill around the root area, and gently firm the soil to prevent major air pockets. Do not pack the soil. Water can be used to help the soil settle and prevent overpacking. Rake the soil even over the entire area, and cover it with two to four inches of mulch. Maintaining the mulch layer carefully will improve tree growth substantially.
(5)
Water berms or dikes are not recommended as they encourage abnormal root growth.
(6)
It is best not to stake the tree, but if wind is a problem or the tree starts to lean, support it with a flexible stake so the trunk will sway in the wind. The movement is necessary for building the trunk's strength. Remove the stake and wire after one growing season since leaving wire or string around the tree can cause death.
(7)
Do not wrap the trunk with "protective" tape. It will slow the tree's ability to adapt to the site and provide a home for insects. Tree bark needs air and sunlight in order to build a healthy protective sheath.
