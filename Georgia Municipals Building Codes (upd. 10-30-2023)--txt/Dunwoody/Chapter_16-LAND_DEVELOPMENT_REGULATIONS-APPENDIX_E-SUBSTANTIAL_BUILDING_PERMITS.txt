APPENDIX E - SUBSTANTIAL BUILDING PERMITS
EXPAND
Example 1
The 100 percent assessed value of the improvements of a 10,000 square foot shopping center is assessed by DeKalb County at $250,000.00.
In January the owner is issued a permit in the amount of $25,000.00 to replace heating and air conditioning equipment. Three months later he is issued a permit in the amount of $50,000.00 to replace the roof covering and add a false mansard roof.
Does this equate to a substantial building permit?
$25,000.00 + $50,000.00 = $75,000.00 (building permits 12 months)
$75,000.00/$250,000.00 = 30.00 percent (less than 50 percent)
This case is not a substantial building permit.
Example 2
The 100 percent assessed value of the improvements of a 10,000 square feet shopping center is assessed by DeKalb County at $250,000.00.
The owner decides to build phase 2 of the shopping center, which includes an additional 6,000 square feet of space. The low bid on the job is $200,000.00.
Does this equate to a substantial building permit?
$200,000.00/$250,000.00 = 80.00 percent (greater than 50 percent)
Yes, this is a substantial building permit.
Example 3
A site is cleared and graded for a gas station but not developed therefore the counties assessed value of the improvements is $0.00.
Two years later the owner applies for a building permit in the amount of $500,000.00 for the construction of a gas station.
Does this equate to a substantial building permit?
Yes, because the permit exceeds half of the value of the improvements.
