Sec. 27-87. - PD, Planned Development district.
(a)
Purpose and administration of district. The PD, Planned Development district is intended to permit the planning and development of parcels of land that are suitable in location and character for the uses proposed as unified and integrated developments in accordance with detailed development plans. The PD district is intended to provide a means of accomplishing the following specific objectives:
(1)
To provide for development concepts not otherwise allowed within non-PD zoning districts;
(2)
To provide flexibility, unity and diversity in land planning and development, resulting in convenient and harmonious groupings of uses, structures and common facilities;
(3)
To accommodate varied type design and layout of housing and other buildings;
(4)
To allow appropriate relationships of open spaces to intended uses and structures;
(5)
To encourage innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development and renewal so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type, design, and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to those buildings;
(6)
To encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services, or private services in lieu thereof, and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that resulting economies may benefit those who need homes;
(7)
To lessen the burden of traffic on streets and highways; and
(8)
To provide a procedure that can relate the type, design, and layout of residential, commercial, and industrial development to the particular site, thereby encouraging preservation of the site's natural characteristics.
(b)
Establishing a planned development.
(1)
No PD district may be established without the concurrent approval of an overall development plan (ODP) by the mayor and city council, in accordance with subsection (c).
(2)
PD districts must have a minimum contiguous land area of 4.5 acres if all or a part is located in the suburban neighborhood character area or in the institutional/campus character area as established in the comprehensive plan. In all other character areas, PD districts must have a minimum contiguous land area of 1.5 acres.
(3)
The boundaries of each PD, upon approval, must be shown on the zoning map, must be in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan, any adopted master plan, and the approved overall development plan.
(4)
Once adopted, an ODP may be modified in the following ways:
a.
The community development director has sole authority to approve minor changes to conditions attached to an approved PD zoning designation. Minor changes are those that implement only slight alterations to the approved conditions, made necessary by actual field conditions at the time of development, that do not alter the impact of the development on nearby properties nor the intent or integrity of the conditions as originally imposed. Any request for minor change of conditions must be made in written form to the community development director. If an approved site plan exists, the request for minor change must be accompanied by a copy of the revised site plan.
b.
Any major change to conditions attached to an approved PD zoning designation requires approval of a zoning map amendment in accordance with the procedures of article V, division 2. Without limiting the meaning of the phrase, the following are deemed to constitute major changes for purposes of interpreting this section:
1.
The movement of any building or structure adjacent to an exterior boundary line, closer to the boundary line of the property to which it is adjacent;
2.
Any increase in the number of dwelling units or any increase in the total amount of floor space of any nonresidential building;
3.
Any decrease in the minimum size of residential units imposed in the original conditional zoning amendment;
4.
Any reduction in any buffer requirement imposed in the original conditional zoning amendment;
5.
Any increase in the height of any building or structure; or
6.
Any change in the proportion of floor space devoted to different authorized uses.
(c)
Application of regulations.
(1)
Overall development plan. Development of the PD is governed by overall development plan that designates the land uses of the PD. The ODP must be accompanied by a development standards text, which may be approved as a condition of zoning, providing development standards and uses for the project that can vary, augment or limit the requirements of this zoning ordinance and the development regulations. The ODP must be submitted as a part of the PD rezoning application.
(2)
At a minimum the ODP must include:
a.
Sketch plan;
b.
Type and location of all intended uses;
c.
Expected gross land areas of all intended uses including open space;
d.
Gross floor area or residential unit size and number for all buildings or structures, including a statement pertaining to the appropriateness of the density and intensity of the suggested uses relative to policies and standards contained within the comprehensive plan;
e.
Architectural elevations of all proposed building sides, a description of the types of exterior treatments of buildings, a site plan to scale, density calculations;
f.
Circulation plan;
g.
Street documentation;
h.
Parking analysis;
i.
A tree plan showing the existing trees on site that are six inches in diameter at breast height or greater for hardwoods and 16 inches in diameter at breast height for other trees;
j.
Existing site survey and a grading plan; and
k.
Any other information deemed necessary by the community development director for planning review.
(3)
To the extent that the approved ODP and development standards for a PD contradict the development regulations and this zoning ordinance, the approved ODP for the PD district governs.
(4)
No changes in land use or density may be allowed in any approved and incorporated overall development plan or development standards text, except as subsequently approved pursuant to a rezoning of the property.
(5)
Architectural compatibility must be determined based upon the context and guidance of the comprehensive plan and specific sub-area plan area in which the PD is located. As a part of the architectural design, a "four-sided" design philosophy must be used, materials used shall be enduring in their composition and include as the primary material, brick, stone or equivalent durable materials.
(6)
Land uses within a PD district may be multiple in nature. The location and relationship of these uses must be as established in and conform to the policies and standards contained within the comprehensive plan and other appropriate adopted and approved plans and established as part of the ODP.
(d)
Planning commission review. When reviewing a map amendment case that includes a lot to be zoned PD, the planning commission may move to table an item to the next regularly scheduled meeting up to three times. Should the planning commission fail to make a recommendation at the fourth meeting the item shall be forwarded to the council without a recommendation. All other considerations of section 2-88 apply unchanged.

Garage doors are permitted on secondary street façades with direct access to the street. The preferred location is on interior lot façades.
b.
Recessed from façades. Garage doors located on street facing façades shall be recessed a minimum of three feet from the dominant façade of the principal building facing the same street.
c.
Design. Garage doors facing a secondary street and intended to be closed during business hours shall be clad with materials consistent with the design of the building. Carriage-style doors are required on the townhouse building type.
(8)
Ground story at sloping façades.
a.
Intent. Given the topography in many parts of Dunwoody Village, building design must accommodate grade changes along the sidewalk without creating tall, out-of-scale blank walls. Large, unarticulated building façades signal to pedestrians that an area is not intended for walking, reducing activity in the area and creating dead zones.
b.
Regulations for shopfronts.
1.
Grade transitions on the building along the sidewalk should be designed to maximize active pedestrian-scale frontages between waist and eye level while minimizing blank walls.
2.
Unless impracticable, the interior floor level shall step to match the exterior grade.
3.
If it is necessary for the interior floor to remain constant along the grade, changes may be accommodated by a storefront window display space.
4.
Knee wall and retaining walls shall not exceed 30 inches in height except along a maximum 15-foot section of façade length.
5.
If grade change is more than 12 feet along a single block face, entrance requirements may be increased to one entrance per 80 feet of building frontage.
c.
Regulations for residential and other building frontages.
1.
Grade transitions at the building along the sidewalk should be designed to minimize blank walls.
2.
Unless impracticable, the interior floor level should step to match the exterior grade.
3.
Transition zones between the sidewalk and building façade of porches, terraces, and landscape areas may be used assist with grade changes.
4.
If it is necessary for the interior floor to remain constant along the grade, changes can be accommodated by terraced planters and retaining walls.
5.
Retaining walls shall not exceed 30 inches in height except along a maximum 15-foot section of frontage.
6.
When the elevation of the first floor is more than three feet above grade, windows should be provided into the basement or lower floor elevations.
(9)
Multi-unit building balconies. All multi-unit residential buildings, including those incorporating non-residential uses, shall incorporate balconies as follows:
a.
At least 50 percent of the dwelling units located on façades facing streets or façades adjacent to open spaces must provide private balconies.
b.
Required balconies must have a minimum depth of four feet and a minimum width of eight feet.
c.
Required balconies may be covered or uncovered.
(e)
Shopfront building regulations.
(1)
Intent. The shopfront building is intended for use as a mixed-use building located close to the sidewalk with parking in the rear or side of the lot. The most distinctive element of this building type is the ground floor front façade with large amounts of storefront glass and regularly spaced pedestrian entrances along the sidewalk, typically for retail and service uses.
(2)
Standards. The following are the regulations for shopfront buildings.
(f)
General building regulations.
(1)
Intent. The general building is intended to be built close to the sidewalk, but may also have a landscape yard. This building can be structured to house offices or residential uses including multi-family, and may have limited amounts of accessory retail and service uses in the ground floor. Parking is typically provided in structures at the rear of the lot, internally in the rear of the building, but may also have limited surface parking along the side of the building.

(2)
Standards. The following are the regulations for townhouse buildings.
(h)
Civic building regulations.
(1)
Intent. The civic building is the most flexible building type and is limited to civic and institutional types of uses. These buildings are distinctive within the village fabric created by the other building types and could be designed as iconic structures.
(2)
Standards. The following are the regulations for civic buildings.
(i)
Explanation of specific building type requirements. The following explains and further defines the standards outlined on the tables on the previous pages, specific to each building type.
(1)
Building siting. The following explains the line item requirements for each building type table within the section entitled "Building siting."
a.
Build-to zone coverage. The minimum percentage of building wall or façade along the street for each street is designated on each building type table.
1.
Measurement. The width of the principal structures (as measured within the build-to zone along the frontage edge) is divided by the length of the frontage parallel to the property line following the street.
2.
Courtyards. Courtyards, per section 27-621, terms defined, located along the façade in the build-to zone count towards the minimum coverage. Refer to street types for limitations of courtyards along some frontages.
b.
Build-to zone.
1.
Defined. The build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building façade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum yard (setback) range from the edge of the right-of-way.
2.
Measurement.
i.
The percent of building façade in build-to zone specifies the amount of the front building façade that must be located in the build-to zone, based on the width of the street-facing building façade divided by the width of the lot. The build-to zone is measured from the edge of the street frontage area onto the site. The lot width shall exclude any portions of the lot used for required transitions, provided new streets, or provided open space.
ii.
When a lot contains multiple buildings, the build-to zone requirements are measured as the sum of all buildings. There are no build-to zone requirements when a building is located behind another building that conforms to build-to zone requirements.
Figure 27-107D-1 Build-to zone with allowed plaza (left) and on corner lot (right)
3.
Open spaces. Outdoor open space, plazas, and outdoor dining areas are counted as part of the building for the purpose of measuring compliance with build-to zone requirements, provided that:
i.
The area does not exceed one-third the length of the building face or 35 feet, whichever is less; and
ii.
The area is no more than 35 feet in depth (refer to figure 27-107D-1).
c.
Corner lots. On corner lots, minimum requirements governing the percent of building façade that must be located in the build-to zone may be reduced by 60 percent along one of the frontages, at the property owner's option, provided that a building façade must be placed in the build-to zone for the first 30 feet along each street extending from the corner (refer to figure 27-107D-1).
1.
Encroachments. Awnings and building mounted signage may extend beyond the build-to zone into the frontage area, but may not extend into the street right-of-way.
2.
Porches, arcades, galleries. Porches, arcades, and galleries may be included on the building façade design, utilizing the range of depth permitted by the build-to zone. If located outside the building coverage requirement, the depth of the arcade or gallery may exceed the build-to zone.
(2)
