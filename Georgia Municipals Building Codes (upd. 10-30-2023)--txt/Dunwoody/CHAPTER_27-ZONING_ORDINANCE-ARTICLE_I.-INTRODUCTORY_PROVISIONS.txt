DIVISION 3. - ZONING MAP

Sec. 27-41. - Establishment.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this zoning ordinance are depicted on and maintained as part of the city's geographic information system (GIS), under the direction of the community development director. This "zoning" geographic coverage layer constitutes the City of Dunwoody's official zoning map. The official zoning map—together with all notations, references, data and other information shown on the map—is adopted and incorporated into this zoning ordinance. It is as much a part of this zoning ordinance as if actually depicted within its pages.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-3.10), 10-14-2013)
Sec. 27-42. - Maintenance and updates.
The community development director is responsible for directing revisions to the official zoning map to reflect its amendment as soon as possible after the effective date of zoning map amendments. No unauthorized person may alter or modify the official zoning map. The community development director may authorize printed copies of the official zoning map to be produced, and must maintain digital or printed copies of superseded versions of the official zoning map for historical reference.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-3.20), 10-14-2013)
Sec. 27-43. - Interpretation of zoning maps.
(a)
The community development director is the final authority in determining the current zoning status of land, buildings and structures in the city.
(b)
Where uncertainty exists regarding the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning maps, the following rules apply:
(1)
Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys must be construed to follow centerlines of rights-of-way or prescriptive easements. In case of closure of a street or alley, or vacation of any easement, the boundary must be construed as remaining at its previous location unless ownership of the closure or vacated area is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary must be construed as moving to correspond with the ownership, but not beyond any previous right-of-way or easement line.
(2)
Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines must be construed as following those lot lines.
(3)
Boundaries indicated as following city limit lines must be construed as following the city limits.
(4)
Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines must be construed to be midway in the railroad right-of-way.
(5)
Boundaries indicated as following shorelines of bodies of water must be construed to follow those shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of creeks, streams, rivers, or other predominantly linear bodies of water must be construed to follow those centerlines.
(6)
Boundaries indicated as parallel to or concentric with, or extensions of features indicated in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(5), must construed to follow those features. Distances and dimensions not specifically indicated on the zoning maps must be determined from the zoning maps by the community development director.
(7)
Where areas appear to be unclassified on the zoning maps, and classification cannot be established by the above rules and there is no other evidence of its existing or past classification, such areas must be considered to be classified R-100 until action is taken by the mayor and city council to amend the zoning maps.
(c)
Where uncertainties continue to exist or further interpretation is required beyond that presented in the above subsections, the question must be presented to the mayor and city council to enact a clarifying ordinance and mayor and city council's action must be recorded on the zoning maps.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-3.30), 10-14-2013)
Sec. 27-44. - Split-zoned lots.
(a)
The zoning map may not be amended to classify a single parcel of land into two or more base zoning districts. This provision does not apply to overlay zoning districts.
(b)
Parcels may not be divided to create a split-zoned parcel of land (into more than one base zoning district classification). This provision does not apply to overlay zoning districts.
(c)
If an existing parcel of land is split into two or more zoning districts, each such portion of the split-zoned parcel may be used only for purposes allowed within the zoning district that each such portion is classified. No principal or accessory use of land, building or structures, and no use or building or structure authorized by administrative permit, special land use permit, or special exception, is allowed unless the use, building or structure is expressly authorized or permitted within the subject zoning district.
