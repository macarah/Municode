APPENDIX A - TREE REPLACEMENT DENSITY FACTOR CALCULATIONS
The following abbreviations are used in the examples below:
TDF—Tree Density Factor
RTF—Remaining Tree Factor
RRD—Required Replacement Density
Step 1. Calculate the tree density factor (TDF) for the site multiplying the number of site acres by 20.
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a TDF OF 2.2 × 20 = 44.
Step 2. Calculate the existing trees, which will remain, or the Remaining Tree Factor (RTF). These will remain on-site and be protected during construction. The RTF is determined by converting the DBH of individual existing trees to density factor units, using table .) These units are then totaled to determine the RTF for the site.
EXAMPLE: A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acres site in step 1. These trees include:
7, 12″ pines
3, 14″ pines
3, 18″ oaks
1, 20″ hickory
1, 30″ oak
When converted to density factor units using step 1, we arrive at the following values:
EXPAND
DBH UNITS QUANTITY # TREES
12″ 0.8 x 7 = 5.6
14″ 1.1 x 3 = 3.3
18″ 1.8 x 3 = 5.4
20″ 2.2 x 1 = 2.2
30″ 4.9 x 1 = 4.9
RTF = 21.4
  The sum total of units, 21.4, is the RTF.
Step 3. Calculate the required replacement density (RRD) by subtracting RTF (step 2) from TDF (step 1).
RRD = TDF - RTF
EXAMPLE: RRD = 44 - 21.4
RRD = 22.6
Step 4. The RRD can be converted back to caliper inches using table 3. Any combination of transplantable trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RRD.
EXAMPLE: On the 2.2-acre site the following number and size of trees will be planted:
EXPAND
Number Size Species Density Factor
15 6' Pines (12 x 0.4) = 6.0
20 2" Red Maples (20 x 0.5) = 10.0
7 6" Oaks (7 x 1.0) = 7.0
23.0
  23.0 is greater than the RRD of 22.6. Thus, the minimum requirements have been met.

SIZE UNITS NUMBER TOTAL UNITS
2″—3″ 0.5 10 5.0
1″ 0.4 100 40.0
TOTAL RRD 45.0
  RTF + RRD > or = TDF
29.0 + 45.0 = 74.0. Thus, the tree density requirement is satisfied.
