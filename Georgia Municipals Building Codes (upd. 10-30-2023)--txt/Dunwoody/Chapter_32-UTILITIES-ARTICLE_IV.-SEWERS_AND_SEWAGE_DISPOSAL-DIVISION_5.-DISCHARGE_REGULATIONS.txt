Sec. 32-328. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
(a)
At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the director or his designee of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 32-334;
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(b)
Pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this division shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. Pollutants, raw materials, products, processed materials or waste materials shall not be stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the storm drain or cause a contaminated discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 6)
Sec. 32-329. - Separators and interceptors.
Grease, oil and sand separators shall be provided when wastes containing more than 100 mg/l of fat, oil, grease or sand are discharged. Separators shall also be provided for any other substance in the wastes which becomes viscous or solidifies at a temperature above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. All interceptors or separators shall be approved in writing by the county and shall be located for easy inspection. All expenses of installation and operation shall be borne by the owner. Interceptors and separators shall not be required for private living quarters.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 7)
Sec. 32-330. - Industrial discharges and surcharges.
(a)
Industrial contributors to the public sanitary sewer system shall be required to pay a sewer rate surcharge based upon the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS), five-day BOD, ammonia and/or total phosphorus in their effluents. Industrial dischargers whose wastes contain greater than 250 mg/l of either five-day BOD and/or total suspended solids, 30 mg/l ammonia, or ten mg/l total phosphorus shall pay the surcharge in an amount set by the county.
(b)
If values for any constituent exceed two times the minimum surcharge concentration (i.e., 500 mg/l TSS) then the director may, if determined that these wastes adversely affect the POTW, require the industrial user to install pretreatment before discharging wastes to the public sanitary sewer system. This pretreatment must reduce the concentration of the wastes by treatment/removal of the excess constituent to the point where it no longer harms the POTW, and the values for all constituents are less than two times the minimum surcharge concentration.
(c)
Periodic determination of the values for constituents subject to surcharge shall be made on composite samples of industrial effluents by personnel of the county.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 8)
Sec. 32-331. - Discharges requiring pretreatment.
The department may require pretreatment of wastewater to an acceptable condition before discharge to the public sanitary sewer system when wastewater contains the substances or possesses the characteristics of prohibited or limited discharges. Pretreatment may also be required if these wastewaters cause upset, interference or pass through at the POTW or have a deleterious effect upon any other aspect of public welfare, either alone or in combination with other discharges. In addition to lowering the concentrations of substances to an acceptable level through pretreatment or altering the characteristics of a wastewater, the department may require additional controls before discharge to the public sanitary sewer system. In particular, quantities or rates of discharge shall be altered so that the discharge becomes more compatible with the sewer system. Expenses incurred in the installation and operation of these controls shall be borne by the industrial user.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 9)
Sec. 32-332. - Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 10)
Sec. 32-333. - Measurements, tests and analyses, and sample collection.
(a)
Any measurements, tests, analyses, sample types, sample containers and/or holding times to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with procedures and specifications as set forth in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(b)
Analyses shall be determined at the control manhole, or upon a suitable sample taken at the control manhole. If no control manhole is available on the building sewer, the control manhole shall be considered the nearest downstream manhole to which the building sewer is directly connected. When the director deems it necessary, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole on the building sewer to facilitate observation and sampling of wastes. This manhole, when required, shall be accessible, safely located, and constructed at the owner's expense in accordance with county specifications.
(c)
Except as indicated in subsection (d) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite sampling techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(d)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, Ph, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 11)
Sec. 32-334. - Accidental spills or drains.
(a)
In the case of accidental spills, loss to the drains of any deleterious material or substances, discharges of a nonroutine nature, noncustomary batch discharges or slug loads, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the department of the incident. This notification shall include the time of occurrence, location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. The user shall take all possible actions to prevent a spill, and should a spill occur, shall take immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the incident. Industrial users which store or otherwise handle toxic, hazardous or flammable materials must have an accidental discharge/slug control plan in place to prevent the discharge, accidental or otherwise, of said materials to the sewer system.
(b)
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall submit a detailed written report, unless waived by the director, describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division.
(c)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 12)
Sec. 32-335. - Discharge of trucked or hauled wastes.
(a)
Discharge to any public sanitary sewer, appurtenance, or treatment facility of pumped, trucked or hauled wastes from commercial or industrial sources is prohibited. This ban specifically includes the disposal of greases and other grease trap-related wastes from food establishments.
(b)
Discharge of domestic septage is allowable only at a county-authorized septic tank disposal site, located at the Snapfinger Creek Water Pollution Control Plant, in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Septic tank pumping companies must register with the county health department division of environmental health; have their trucks inspected by that agency; and be issued a permit to operate.
(2)
Discharge fees shall be payable by coupons obtained at the county division of revenue and license administration, and presented to the operator at the disposal site. Fees shall be as established by the county.
(3)
A manifest form must be completed on every septic tank pumped. Copies of the manifests for the septage to be discharged must be presented to the operator at the disposal site. The operator shall have the authority to deny approval for discharge to any load not accompanied by manifests, due to discrepancies with the manifests, or other apparent problems with truck contents.
(4)
Domestic septage shall be defined as the contents from septic tanks located at single-family residences, county school facilities, or the contents of portable toilets.
(5)
Repeat and/or major violations of these regulations may result in the county barring the hauling company from the treatment facility and denying access to disposal in the county's system, in addition to the other fines and penalties cited in this division.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 13)
Sec. 32-336. - Emergency suspensions.
(a)
The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend the user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the order, sewer connection, and/or termination of water supply, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement to the director, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
(b)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 5, § 14)
