Such application shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs or plans as may be required by the commission.

Plans. An application for certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the commission.
(e)
Reaction to application.
(1)
The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood.
(2)
The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the esthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district.
(f)
Notice; hearing. At least seven days prior to review of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by reason of the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application.
(g)
Certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood.
(h)
Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features.
(i)
Technical advice. When dealing with difficult technical questions, the commission shall have the power to seek expert advice.

Deadline for approval or rejection.
(1)
The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within not more than 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a structure, site, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission.
(2)
The failure of the commission to act within the 45-day period shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.
(k)
Rejection of application.
(1)
If the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefor, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. It shall be the responsibility of the commission to provide written notice to the building official, or such other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, of the commission's rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness.
(l)
Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in an exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall be a situation not of the person's own making, which is:
(1)
A problem unique to a specific property; or
(2)
In order to comply with this article, the person will be in conflict with another ordinance of the city.
(m)
Conformance with certificate. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted before it is completed.

(p)
Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein.
(q)
Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the council; the appeal must be applied for within 15 days after notification is sent. The council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the council made pursuant to the Georgia Historic Preservation Act, O.C.G.A. § 44-10-20 et seq., may be taken to the superior court of the county, in the manner provided by law, for appeals from a conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations.

(1)
The structure is of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as an historic or architectural landmark.
(2)
The structure is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense.
