  For pollutants with a daily maximum concentration limit, the daily and monthly average limits shall equal the daily maximum limit.
The concentration limits in subsection (g) of this section are set by the city as maximal. These limits apply to the discharges from all industrial users and other users (as appropriate) before they enter and are mixed with the public sewerage system. The actual sampling location for each industrial user will be stipulated in the permit. The limits may be reduced by order of the director at any time when it is found that the wastewater treatment plant does not meet its proper limits of treatment, and the director may establish concentration limits for other substances as may be appropriate. All users on the system must comply with all such standard limits within a reasonable time period established by the director, or as required by other regulatory agencies.
The pollutants listed in subsection (g) of this section shall be analyzed to the appropriate detection limits as specified by the state environmental protection division. If the results for a given sample are such that a parameter is not detected at or above the specified detection limit, a value of "not detected" shall be reported for that sample and the detection limits will also be reported. A value of "not detected" shall be considered as within the allowable concentration limits listed in this section.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
Except for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (d)(6) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (d)(3)d. and e. of this section;
b.
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection a. of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
c.
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
d.
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
e.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(9)
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.
(e)
Pretreatment limits. No industry will exceed the pretreatment limits as established by the EPA in accordance with Section 307(B) and (C) of the Act (33 USC 1347) which applies to a specific category of industrial users.
(f)
Diluting wastewater. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(g)
Public information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other government agency without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret.
(1)
When requested by the discharger, the portion of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall be submitted to the city for uses relating to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; but marked "confidential business information" on each page containing such information. All such pages shall be clearly marked at the time of submittal. If such a claim is made, the information shall not be released as public information.
(2)
Such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review of enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report.
(3)
Effluent data as provided to the city and collected by the city shall be available as public information.
(h)
Monitoring. The city may require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities, to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(i)
Federal standards—Generally. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed pursuant to this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations locally imposed. The director shall notify all affected users of the new standard and applicable reporting requirements. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(j)
Same—Modifications. Where the wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. The term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2), general pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution promulgated pursuant to the act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
(k)
Revision of permit. Upon the promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the permit of any user subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance within the time frame prescribed by such standard.
(l)
Accidental or slug discharges.
(1)
Generally. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. No industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW after September 11, 1984 shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been reviewed by the city. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article.
(2)
Emergency notification. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director and the city water pollution control plant of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(m)
Same—Report. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fine, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law or ordinance.
(n)
Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by this section; and
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response (40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v)).
(o)
Director's rules. The director shall have full power and authority to promulgate, with the approval of the council, a pretreatment program pursuant to the Act and 40 CFR 403 et seq., and he is hereby vested with the authority and responsibility to enforce the same. To that end, he shall have full power to do any of the following:
(1)
Deny any increased or new discharges or stipulate the conditions under which any increased or new discharge may be accepted to the system.
(2)
Periodically (at least once every five years), develop revised local pretreatment limits for discharges by nondomestic users into the sewers and POTW of the city. Local limits shall be technically derived from federal and state standards and adjusted by POTW data and the most recent research.
(3)
Require compliance with pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements by industrial users.
(4)
Control industrial discharges to the treatment works to ensure compliance.
(5)
Require the development of an industrial compliance schedule for installation of required technologies.
(6)
Require nondomestic users to submit detailed information on the contaminants present in their discharge and to submit periodic self-monitoring reports to assess and assure compliance with this article.
(7)
Conduct inspections, surveillance and monitoring procedures to independently determine compliance or noncompliance.
(8)
Have the right of entry for inspection and sampling. The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section. Users shall allow the director and the directors deputies ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. When toxic substances are being investigated, samples can be collected from any location in the user's facility for any toxic chemical analysis or bioassay.
a.
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
b.
The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
c.
The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at the user's expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
d.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
e.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
f.
If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the court of the city.
(9)
Develop an enforcement response plan to assist city personnel when the nondomestic user is not in compliance with the pretreatment limits or permit requirements. Consistent use of this plan will assure that the pretreatment regulations are equitably enforced;
(10)
Issue notifications of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without issuing a notice of violation;
(11)
Convene a show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user;
(12)
Issue administrative compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user;
(13)
Issue consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agrement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (o)(12) and (o)(14) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable;
(14)
Issue cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease illegal or previously authorized discharges immediately or to terminate the noncompliant users discharge altogether. In an emergency situation, a cease and desist order can be used to protect the POTW and the receiving water body, in addition to public safety, even though the termination of the discharge will stop operations at the users facility;
(15)
Independently assess, or recover through judicial action, fines, penalties and injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with:
a.
Pretreatment standards;
b.
Inspections, entry or monitoring activities;
c.
Any rules, regulations or orders; or
d.
Any reporting requirements imposed.
(16)
Issue emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. Nothing in subsection (o)(18) of this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section:
a.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (o)(19) of this section are initiated against the user.
b.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (o)(11) or (o)(18) of this section.
(17)
Terminate discharge. In addition to the provisions of this section, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
a.
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
b.
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
c.
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
d.
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
e.
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 90-53.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(18)
Sewer water supply. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply;
(19)
Petition for injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user;
(20)
Do any and all other acts and things necessary or appropriate to comply with the general pretreatment regulations, 40 CFR 403, and to carry out the city's pretreatment program; and
(p)
Water conservation program. The city will develop a water conservation program and all water and sewer customers are required to cooperate with the development of such program, and customers with water use in excess of 50,000 gallons per day will be required to provide an analysis of process water usage and develop a conservation program when requested by the city.
(q)
State requirements generally. State requirements and limitations on discharge shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal or local requirements.
(r)
Rules of city. The city reserves the right to establish more stringent limitations or requirements on the discharges to the wastewater disposal system, if such action is deemed necessary to comply with the objectives of this article.
(s)
Civil penalties.
(1)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2)
The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(t)
Criminal prosecution.
(1)
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
(2)
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
(4)
If there is a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.
(u)
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations; upsets.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) of this section are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, the following written submission must be provided within five days:
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(v)
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations; prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 90-85(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(w)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section:
a.
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsection (w)(3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section.
(3)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(4)
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(5)
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (w)(3) of this section.
(6)
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (w)(5) of this section.
(Ord. of 9-14-1999, § 18-55)
Sec. 90-86. - Hauled wastewaters.
(a)
The city may require a permit for the discharge of septage after submission of an application on forms supplied by the city. Septage shall mean putrid or offensive matter, the contents of all privies, septic tanks and cesspools. All other materials and substances, chemicals or chemical compounds and/or industrial wastes will not be permitted to be discharged into the public sewerage system unless a discharge permit has been obtained for this waste as provided under section 90-84. Discharge permits will not permit the discharge of the substances prohibited in section 90-83(a) through (e).
(b)
The discharge of hauled industrial wastes into the sewerage system is permissible at the discretion of the director. The director shall require generators of hauled industrial waste and leachate from municipal landfills to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The discharge of hauled leachate from municipal landfills will be subject to the same requirements as hauled industrial wastes. The director may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may also prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The disposal of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements under this article.
(c)
All haulers for discharge of hauled septage, shall furnish the following information with each application:
(1)
Name and address of applicant;
(2)
Volume of septic waste for each numbered vehicle;
(3)
Number of vehicles in septage collection service; and
(4)
Characteristics of the wastes.
(d)
The discharge of the wastes in subsection (a) and (b) of this section shall be made only at locations in the sewerage system as shall be designated by the director and at such times as are established by the director. The director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. Such waste shall not violate section 90-83 of this article or any other requirements established by the city. The disposal of prohibited substances, such as grease and other substances listed in section 90-83(d) and (e) is likewise prohibited when wastes are hauled to the sewage treatment plant.
(e)
Hauled wastes will be admitted into the sewerage system only after approval by the director and subject to payment of a fee. Such fee shall be published separate from this article.
(f)
The hauler shall be the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle discharging the wastes. All equipment, such as trucks, tanks, pumps and hose used in the collection and/or transportation of hauled wastewaters shall be modern equipment in good repair. When more than one vehicle is used by an applicant, each vehicle shall be assigned an identifying number.
(g)
Prior to discharging any hauled wastes, the hauler must complete a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum the following:
(1)
The name and address of the waste hauler;
(2)
Discharge permit number (if the hauled waste is landfill leachate or industrial wastes);
(3)
Truck identification;
(4)
Names and addresses of sources of waste; and
(5)
Volume and characteristics of waste.
The form shall identify the known or suspected waste constituents and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
