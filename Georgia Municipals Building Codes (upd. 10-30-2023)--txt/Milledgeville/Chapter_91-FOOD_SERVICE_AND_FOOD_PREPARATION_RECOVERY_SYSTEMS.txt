Chapter 91 - FOOD SERVICE AND FOOD PREPARATION RECOVERY SYSTEMS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 91-1. - Purpose; objective.
Excessive amounts of fats, oils, grease, grit, sand, and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation and vehicle maintenance facilities.
This chapter sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial waste sludge and byproducts.
The objective of this chapter is:
(1)
To minimize the introduction of fats, oils, and greases into the city wastewater collection system.
(2)
By enactment of these regulations, the city intends to exercise its authority over the main components of the program which are the proper sizing, installation, and maintenance of grease interceptors.
(3)
To establish the administration and inspection requirements of food service facilities herein as well.
(4)
To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with Chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the Rules and Regulations of the EPD.

The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
(e)
The interceptor shall be installed on a separate building sewer line servicing kitchen flows and shall be connected only to those fixtures or drains which would allow fats, oils, and grease to be discharged. These shall include: pot-sinks, pre-rinse sinks, any sink into which fats, oils and grease are likely to be introduced, soup kettles or similar devices, wok stations, floor drains or sinks into which kettles may be drained, automatic hood wash units, dishwashers without pre-rinse sinks, and any other fixtures or drains that are likely to allow fats, oil and grease to be discharged.

Under sink grease traps or alternative treatment systems, such as mechanical grease recovery devices, shall be used on a case by case evaluation and authorization of the city. In no case shall an inside grease trap be less than 50 pounds.
(5)
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by city. The city reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(Ord. No. O-1311-013, 1-14-2014)
Sec. 91-8. - Grease interceptor maintenance.
(a)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(b)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by the city.
(c)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed city's limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 25 of the total depth of the trap, the city will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(d)
The user will ensure that each grease trap or interceptor is serviced at a frequency as required by the city. The user will supervise the cleaning of the grease trap or interceptor to ensure the proper and total removal of contents.
(e)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
(f)
Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city. Such additives shall include, but are not limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
(g)
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.

(5)
Keep one copy of the completed manifest form demonstrating delivery to the disposal site operator for their records and shall maintain such records for a period of three years; except that the transporter manifest (or copy thereof) covering not less than the immediately preceding ten-day period for a particular tank truck shall be kept in the transporter's tank truck. All such records shall be available for inspection.
(6)
Remove the entire contents of any commercial tank that is serviced and dispose of such contents, unmingled with hazardous wastes or septic wastes, only at a facility authorized to receive such waste.

(b)
Transporters are to ensure that an approved manifest system is used to document the transportation of separators/grease trap contents.
(c)
All transporters of grease trap/separator waste shall:
(1)
Ensure all the contents or a separator/grease trap waste area removed as completely as mechanically possible.
(2)
No decant or discharge waste removed will be allowed back into a trap or separator from which the waste was originally removed for the purposed of reducing the volume to be transported.
(3)
Determine, before accepting a load of liquid trap waste for transportation, the nature of the material to ensure that his equipment is sufficient to properly handle the job without spillage.
(4)
Only dispose of grease trap/interceptor and oil separator waste at sites approved by the state.
