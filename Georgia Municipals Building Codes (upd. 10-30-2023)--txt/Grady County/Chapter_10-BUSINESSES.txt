Sec. 10-151. - Bond or letter of credit required.
new
(a)
The notice required by this article shall not be or remain effective unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the governing authority of Grady County or its designated agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting Grady County against any damage caused by such person or firm in the amount of $5,000.00; provided, however, that at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of $5,000.00 may be provided in lieu of a surety bond. Such bonds or letters of credit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this article. No more than one bond or letter of credit shall be required from each person or firm harvesting timber, regardless of the number of tracts harvested in the county for so long as the bond or letter of credit remains in effect. The bond or letter of credit required herein shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it was delivered.
(b)
The bond or letter of credit required by subsection (a) of this section shall protect Grady County against any damage requiring re-ditching or repair of existing ditch structures or the removal of any harvesting residue, including tree tops, debris, logs, pulpwood and other materials, placed in or around the county's rights of way caused by such person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights of way. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall also be available to reimburse the county for any costs incurred to maintain or repair county roads damaged by the ingress or egress of motor vehicles engaged in the harvest operations located within 500 feet of any point of ingress or egress of the timber harvesting operation. The right of Grady County to call such bond or letter of credit in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall be in addition to any other remedies available to the county at law or in equity for damage to county roads or rights-of-way.
(c)
When damage results from a person or firm's harvesting activities, the governing authority of Grady County shall make and provide a written claim to the person or firm causing the damage within 30 business days after the governing authority becomes aware of the damage. Such claim may be given in person, by telefacsimile, email or mail. The claim shall describe the damage in detail and, in compliance with subsection (d)(1) of this section, give the person or firm the opportunity to repair such damage within 30 days of the notification; provided, however, the county shall be authorized to repair the damage immediately if the governing Authority or its designee determines the conditions present a threat to public safety, health or welfare and, upon making such repairs, shall present to the person or firm and the issuer of the applicable bond or letter of credit an itemized list of expenses incurred as a claim against the responsible party and the issuer of its bond or letter of credit. Upon the issuance of a claim as provided in this Section the Governing Authority of Grady County or its designee shall notify the issuer of the bond or letter of credit that a claim has been made and will be resolved or adjudicated according to the terms of this Ordinance.
(d)
Within 30 days of receipt of the written claim described in subsection (c), the person or firm against whom the claim is submitted may:
(1)
Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the governing authority of Grady County or its designee. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of the governing authority or its designee, the governing authority or its designee shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.
(2)
In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30 day extension to repair the damage from the governing authority of Grady County, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered. Approval of any extension shall be at the discretion of the governing authority of Grady County or its designee.
(3)
Appeal the claim to the Magistrate Court of Grady County. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The Magistrate Court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, required by subsection (c) of this section. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the county the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the governing authority of Grady County shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(4)
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsections (1), (2) or (3) of this section within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.
(e)
If the person or firm tendering a bond or letter of credit pursuant to the requirements of this article continues its timber harvesting operation beyond the calendar year in which the bond or letter of credit was issued, the person or firm continuing the timber harvesting operation shall tender a new bond or letter of credit within five business days after the first day of the new calendar year.
(f)
In the event a bond or letter of credit tendered pursuant to the requirements of this article is revoked by the surety or bank, then a valid replacement bond or letter of credit must be delivered to the governing authority of Grady County within five business days after the date of revocation in order for timber harvesting operations to continue. In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The maximum amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not exceed $10,000.00.
