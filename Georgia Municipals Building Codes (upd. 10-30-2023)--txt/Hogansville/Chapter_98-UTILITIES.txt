a.
Generally. Industrial service is applicable to industrial customers whose main function is the manufacture of finished products, the extraction, fabrication or processing of raw materials, the preservation of raw materials or finished products, for all legitimate power and residential lighting requirements in the operation of the industrial plants. No electricity may be resold, transmitted to other premises, nor used in related commercial enterprise without the express consent of the city.

b.
Determination of demand. The demand shall be based on the highest 30-minute kW measurements during the current month and the preceding 11 months and not less than 100 percent of the highest demand occurring during any previous summer month (June through October).

The availability of service at this schedule is dependent upon the city having gas delivery capacity in excess of the then existing requirements of other customers and having available from its supplier at the delivery point nearest to the customer an adequate supply of natural gas to meet the customer's requirements.
(2)
State sales tax is added when applicable.
(3)

If, upon one-hour notice by the city, the customer fails to comply with a curtailment notice calling for complete or partial curtailment of gas deliveries and by reason thereof the city is charged by its supplier with overrun penalties, the customer shall be billed for the amount of such penalties which are due to its failure to comply with such curtailment notices.
(4)
The payment of an overrun penalty shall not, under any circumstances, be considered as giving the customer the right to take unauthorized overrun gas, nor shall payment be considered to exclude or limit any other remedies (including turning off the gas service valve at the customer's premises) available to the city or other customer against the offending customer for failing to comply with its obligation to operate within the provisions of all curtailment orders.
(5)
The availability of service at the rate schedule shall be at the city's option and is dependent upon the city having gas delivery capacity in excess of the requirements of all other customers during the period of curtailment.

A user who falls within a regulated industrial subcategory shall comply with the national categorical pretreatment standards (40 C.F.R. §§ 405-471, as amended from time to time) for that particular industrial subcategory. If the national categorical pretreatment standards are less stringent than the state pretreatment standards or local pollutant limitations applicable to the user, the user shall comply with the more stringent standards. The national categorical pretreatment standards (Title 40 C.F.R. §§ 405-471), as amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference into this article.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsection 98-115(g).
(2)
When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as a mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial user.
(3)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e).
(d)
State pretreatment standards. A user shall comply with state pretreatment standards applicable to the user. If the state pretreatment standards are less stringent than the national pretreatment standards or local pollutant limitations applicable to the user, the user shall comply with the more stringent standards. The state pretreatment standards, as amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference into this article.
(e)
Local pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge wastewater containing concentrations, referred to as local pollutant limitations, in excess of:
EXPAND
20 mg/L ammonia nitrogen
2.1 mg/L arsenic
1.2 mg/L cadmium
4.5 mg/L copper
1.75 mg/L cyanide
100 mg/L total fats, oils or grease (FOG)
0.60 mg/L lead
0.02 mg/L mercury
4.1 mg/L nickel
1.0 mg/L phenol
10.0 mg/L phosphorous
1.2 mg/L silver
20 mg/L total Kjeldahl nitrogen
7.0 mg/L total chromium
4.2 mg/L zinc
  The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above.
(f)
Best management practices. The director may develop BMPs, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of subsections 98-115(a) and (b).
(g)
Equivalent mass limits. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the control authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director. The control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions listed in subsections 98-115(g)(1) and (2).
(1)
To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
a.
Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
b.
Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to archive compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
c.
Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
d.
Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
e.
Have consistently compiled with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(2)
An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
a.
Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
b.
Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
c.
Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (g)(1);
d.
Upon notification of a revised production rate, the director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
e.
Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsections (g)(1)a. of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
(3)
When developing equivalent mass limits, the director:
a.
Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;
b.
Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
c.
May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 98-115(i). The industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 98-115(q) regarding the prohibition of bypass.
(4)
The director may convert the mass limits to the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. §§ 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the director.
(5)
Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
(6)
Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
(7)
Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production- based standard shall notify the director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.
(h)
City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or permit, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW and storm water conveyance system if the city deems it necessary in order to comply with the objectives of this article.
(i)
Dilution prohibitions.
(1)
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment requirement or standard.
(2)
Unpolluted water, including, but not limited to, city water, non-contact cooling water, or blowdown shall not be discharged to the POTW for purposes of diluting wastewater in order to reduce sewer rates or charges of the user.
(j)
Fats, oil and grease. Controlled devices and other regulations regarding fats, oil, and grease interceptors are subject to the requirements of section 98-118.
(k)
Control manhole requirements.
(1)
Non-residential users who own, operate, or maintain a commercial or industrial facility connected to the POTW who make a new connection or modify an existing connection to the POTW shall install a control manhole unless the director determines that a control manhole is not required.
(2)
Additionally, the director shall have the authority to require any user, at the user's expense, to install a control manhole if determined that such manhole is necessary to protect the POTW.
(l)
Limitations on point of discharge. No person shall discharge any waste, wastewater, pollutant or other substance directly into a manhole or other opening in the POTW other than through the approved sewer lateral, except in accordance with the terms of this article or by express written permission of the director.
(m)
Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.
(1)

Any significant industrial user who is discharging industrial waste to the POTW shall provide to the director independent access and the means and facilities for observing, measuring and sampling such industrial waste. The director shall have full access at all times to the SIU's monitoring facility or facilities to conduct tests on quality and quantity of effluent. The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by any industrial user into the POTW may be determined by one or more of the following methods:
a.
If the entire volume of water used by an SIU is purchased from the city, then the volume of water purchased from the city shall be considered to be the volume of industrial waste discharged;
b.
If the entire volume of water used by an SIU is purchased from the city and the volume of water used for industrial purposes is less than the volume of water purchased from the city, the SIU shall either install and maintain a meter on the industrial waste line; or use another method approved by the director to determine the volume of industrial waste discharged; or
c.
If any SIU now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste to the POTW and does not purchase its entire water supply from the city, then the volume or quantity of industrial wastes discharged by an SIU shall be determined as follows:
1.
The SIU shall install and maintain a meter or meters on all private water supply lines. The volume of industrial waste discharged shall be considered the sum of the volume of water purchased from the city and the volume of water metered from the private water supply; or
2.
The SIU shall install and maintain a meter on the industrial waste line to determine the volume of industrial waste discharged.
(2)
Measurement of other non-residential flow. If any other non-residential user now discharging or proposing to discharge to the POTW and does not purchase its entire water supply from the city, then the volume or quantity of wastewater discharged by the non-residential user may be determined by one of the methods listed in subsection 98-116(d)(1).
(3)
Location of monitoring facilities. The director may require an industrial user to provide and operate, at its own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the user's industrial waste. The monitoring facility shall be located on the industrial user's premises unless the director determines that such a location would be impractical for purposes of providing independent and unscheduled monitoring activities or causes undue hardship on the industrial user. In such cases, with the director's approval, the monitoring facility may be constructed in the public right-of way or easement, in an unobstructed location. The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The industrial user shall maintain its monitoring facilities and sampling and measuring equipment in safe and proper operating condition. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the director's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a manner to enable the director to perform independent monitoring activities.
(e)
Inspection and sampling.

a.
The director may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the user is complying with the provisions and requirements of this article. The director shall perform a minimum of one scheduled and one unscheduled inspection each calendar year at each SIU.
b.
Upon request by the director, users shall allow the director and the approval authority access to all parts of the premises within a reasonable time frame as determined by the director for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this article. The director and the approval authority shall have the right to enter onto a user's property to set up such devices as are necessary to sample, inspect, monitor or meter operations of the user to determine compliance with this article. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its property, the user shall make necessary arrangements so that upon presentation of suitable identification, the director and the approval authority shall be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
c.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the director and the approval authority access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(2)
Search warrants. The director may obtain an administrative search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction when the director has been refused access to a building, structure, property, or any part thereof. The director must be able to demonstrate that a user is violating any provision of this article or as part of a routine inspection and sampling program, needs to inspect or sample to verify compliance with this article or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community.
(3)
Sample analyses.
a.
All analyses, including sampling results submitted in support of any application, reports, evidence, or required by any permit or order, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. § 136, as amended. If 40 C.F.R. § 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the director.
b.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be calibrated, properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times.

(c)
General criteria.
(1)
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the city wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the city that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. A passive interceptor inside the facility shall not be allowed. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the city. While under normal circumstances a 1,500-gallon outside grease interceptor will be required, under proper circumstances the grease enforcement officer may authorize the installation of a fully automated inside grease interceptor.
(2)
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the city wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the city grease management program in the following manner:
a.
The city will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the city.
b.
Each food service facility in the vicinity of any problem areas will be inspected. During such inspection, the city will review applicable maintenance records and will assess the adequacy of the facilities' grease control practices and grease control interceptor/equipment.
c.
Following the inspections, the city will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions:
1.
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor which are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
2.
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the city a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and periodic pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
3.
Facilities found by the city to have failed to achieve compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance.
(3)
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city.
(4)
Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles. Educational materials are available from the city sewer department regarding the minimization of these wastes.
(5)

All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chamber(s) as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer.
(3)
Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
(4)
Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
(5)
Sampling vault. After any interceptor a sampling vault for inspections on the effluent shall be installed. It should contain all the load bearing capacity as a trap. It shall contain one hinged manhole cover labeled "SEWER".
(6)
Interceptor sizing.
a.
Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results.
1.
Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (S) x (25) x (Hr/12)
S = Number of seats
Hr = Maximum hours of daily operation (include preparation and clean up)

  Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the city. The city reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(e)
Grease interceptor maintenance.
(1)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(2)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. In the discretion of the city, pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if user can demonstrate that such schedule meets with the intent of this article.
(3)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed city maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, the city will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(4)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
(5)
Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city. Such additives shall include, but are not limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
(6)
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
(f)
Administrative requirements.
(1)
Initial data acquisition. All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. The city database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection.
(2)
Administrative fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by the city. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, a $50.00 re-inspection fee shall be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved.
(3)
Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of the city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program.
(4)
Record retention and reporting. All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of two years:
a.
Manifests are required for all grease interceptors and shall contain the following information:
1.
Food service facility (generator) information, including name, address, volume pumped, date and time of pumping, and generator signature verifying the information;
2.
Transporter information, including company name, address, license plate number, permit number, driver name, and driver signature verifying transporter information;
3.
Receiving information, including facility name, address, date and time of receiving, EPD permit number, and signature verifying receipt of the waste;
4.
Manifests must be mailed, faxed, or electronically submitted to the grease enforcement coordinator within 14 days of interceptor maintenance; and
5.
A manifest may not be required for under-sink or inline grease interceptors if user can demonstrate to the city a valid reason for such exception.
b.
Maintenance logs are required for all under-sink and in-line interceptors. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped or cleaned, hauler, disposal site, and signature. Log shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. This log shall be made immediately available to the health officer or city representative upon request.
(g)
Enforcement. The following list is arranged from least severe to most severe:
(1)
Letter of warning (LW). When the grease enforcement coordinator finds that a user is not in compliance with any provision of this article, the coordinator will serve that user with a written warning describing the non-compliance in detail.
(2)
Notice of violation (NOV). If the non-compliance issue is not addressed by the user within a three-day period following the letter of warning, a written notice of violation will be issued. According to the severity of the violation the user will be given up to 30 days from receipt of this notice to issue an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required action, shall be submitted by the user to the grease enforcement coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the grease enforcement coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(3)
Site visit or re-inspection (SV). Upon the receipt of plans from the user and the allotted time for corrections to be made has expired, the grease enforcement coordinator will re-inspect the facility to assure all violations have been corrected.
(4)
Consent orders (CO). The grease enforcement coordinator may enter into consent orders, assurances, of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.
(5)
Increased self-monitoring or reporting (ISM). The grease enforcement coordinator may require monitoring devices to be installed at the facility in violation for measuring the amount of grease being released at said facility. Additional reporting of pumping frequency or other means of meeting the requirement in order to be in compliance will be required of the user.
(6)
Cease and desist order (CDO). When the grease enforcement coordinator determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any other standard or requirement, the grease enforcement coordinator has the authority to issue an order to the user directing them to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
a.
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
b.
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(7)
Judicial enforcement remedies or litigation (summons) (LIT). Should the grease enforcement coordinator determine that a violation has jeopardized the health and/or welfare of the public or that a violation cannot be resolved with the user administratively, he may cause the issuance of a summons for violation of this article. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this section, or order issued hereunder, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(8)
Remedies non-exclusive. The remedies provided for in this section are not exclusive. The grease enforcement coordinator may take any, all or any combination of remedial actions against a non-compliant user.

The director may also issue a cease and desist order if the user has failed to meet the terms and conditions of an issued consent order or if the user's past violations are likely to reoccur. The director may issue such an order directing the user to cease all such violations. The user shall immediately comply with all requirements and take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation. That may include halting operations or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(5)
Show cause.
a.
Order to show cause. The board may issue a written order to show cause to any user who violates or continues to violate any provision of this article, a permit, order issued hereunder, or any other applicable pretreatment requirement. The order to show cause shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, upon the user or the user's duly authorized representative. The order to show cause shall describe the noncompliance and the proposed enforcement action. The order to show cause shall also specify the place where a written response shall be filed and the date by which it shall be filed. In addition, the order to show cause should indicate that:
1.
If the allegations of the order to show cause are not disputed, the written response should include a statement that the user intends to comply with the order. The response shall address each violation in the order to show cause and describe the steps that the user intends to take to address the violation. The director shall review the user's written response and shall notify the user within 30 calendar days after the written response is received whether the response is satisfactory. If the director determines that the written response is satisfactory, the matter shall not be scheduled for hearing. However, if the director determines that the written response is unsatisfactory, then the matter shall be scheduled for a hearing before the board. Failure to respond shall be a violation of this article.
2.
If the allegations of the order to show cause are disputed, the user shall submit a written request for a hearing before the board. The president of the board shall then issue a notice setting forth the date, time and place of the hearing and shall serve the notice upon the user in the same manner as prescribed for service of the order to show cause.
b.
Hearing before the board. The board shall conduct the hearing at a regularly scheduled meeting or at any other time acceptable to the board. The board:
1.
May request the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; and
2.
Shall take the evidence.
c.
Issuance of orders. After the board reviews the evidence, it may issue an order to the user directing that wastewater service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities or devices have been installed by a specified date. The board may also order wastewater service to be discontinued unless existing treatment facilities and devices are properly operated. Further orders and directives may be issued. If the user violates the board's order, the board may also take any other appropriate legal action.
(6)
Termination of service. Any user who violates or continues to violate any provision of this article, a permit, or order issued hereunder or any other applicable pretreatment standard or requirement may be subject to suspension or termination of wastewater service.
a.

In an emergency, the order to cease discharge may be given by telephone, followed by written confirmation of such notice. In non-emergency situations, an administrative order may be used to suspend or terminate wastewater service. If the user fails to comply with the suspension or termination order, the city shall take all steps as deemed necessary to halt the discharge including immediate severance of the wastewater connection.
b.
The board shall not reinstate the permit or the wastewater service until proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge and any costs for disconnection and reconnection of wastewater service have been paid by the user.
(7)
Publication of violations. The director shall, at least annually, publish in the newspaper of general circulation, having the largest circulation within the city, a list of the users that were in significant noncompliance at any time during the previous 12 months.
(b)
Legal action.
(1)
A user shall be liable for any and all damages, losses and expenses sustained by the city as a result of noncompliance. The corporation counsel may commence an action for appropriate legal and equitable relief in the appropriate court of Troup County, Georgia in order to obtain remedies for noncompliance by the user.
(2)
When the director finds that a user has violated any terms of their permit, this article, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city may petition the court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction. The injunction would compel the specific performance of the user to be in compliance with the permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
(c)
Affirmative defenses.
(1)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of this article, if the user can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
a.
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
b.
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(2)
Bypass.
a.
For the purposes of this section:
1.
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
2.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
b.
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c. and d. of this section.
c.
Bypass notifications.
1.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten calendar days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
2.
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five calendar days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
d.
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
1.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection 98-118(c)(2)c. of this section.
e.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsections 98-118(c)(2)b., c. and d. of this section.
(3)
Upset.
a.
For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
b.
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, the following facts:
1.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
2.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent manner and in compliance with applicable O&M procedures; and
3.
The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five calendar days:
A.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
B.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
C.
Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance.
c.
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
d.
Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
e.
Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
