Design requirements of new towers. The tower shall be structurally designed to accommodate at least five additional antenna arrays equivalent to those of the applicant regarding the load and stress created on the tower, and located as close to the applicant's antenna as possible without causing interference. A claim of interference because of a need to have greater than six feet of vertical clearance between facilities, measured from the vertical centerline of one array to the vertical centerline of another, must be proven by technical data and not merely verbal or written assertions. This requirement may be waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the provisions of future shared usage of the tower is not technologically feasible, is commercially impracticable or creates an unnecessary and unreasonable burden, based upon:
(1)
The kind of wireless telecommunications facilities site and structure proposed;
(2)
Available space on existing and approved towers; and
(3)
The need for more than six feet of vertical clearance between antenna arrays, measured from the vertical centerline of one array to the vertical centerline of another, such that there would not be adequate vertical space to accommodate a total of four carriers.
(b)
The owner of a proposed new tower, and his/her successors in interest, shall negotiate in good faith for the shared use of the proposed tower by other wireless service providers in the future, and shall:
(1)
Respond within 60 days to a request for information from a potential shared-use applicant;
(2)
Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new tower by other telecommunications providers;
(3)
Allow shared use of the new tower if another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges. The charges may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design, construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, less depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing electromagnetic interference; and
(4)
Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for revocation of the special use permit.

Sec. 30-403. - Location of wireless telecommunications facilities.
(a)
Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, one being the highest priority and five being the lowest priority:
(1)
On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure.
(2)
On government-owned properties or facilities.
(3)
On properties in areas zoned for business use.
(4)
On properties in areas zoned for agricultural use.
(5)
On properties in areas zoned for residential use.
(b)
If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the wireless facility as proposed.
(c)
An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address colocation as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the city why colocation is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting colocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
(d)
Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the city may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this section and the public interest as determined by city.
(e)
The applicant shall submit a detailed written report demonstrating the applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application, including the technical justification for such.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 1-6-2009)
Sec. 30-404. - Height of telecommunications towers.
(a)
All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed-type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.
(b)
The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
(c)
The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 100 feet above preconstruction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 100-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
(d)
Notwithstanding the 100-foot maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within the city.

(d)
Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this section.
(e)
If lighting is required, applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. All towers requiring lighting shall be lighted so as to effectively eliminate the ground scatter effect of the lighting and so as to prevent the light from being seen from the ground.
(f)
All new or replacement antennas, except omni-directional whip antennas, shall be flush-mounted on any tower or other structure, unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable.
(g)
If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the facie of the building and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances involved.
(h)
For any wireless facility for which lighting is required under the FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air. but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it is not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 12 degrees vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
