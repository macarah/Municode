(Ord. of 3-1-2005(02), § II(1400—1408))
Sec. 30-38. - Nonconforming uses.
(a)
Purpose. Invariably, at the time an ordinance is adopted or amended, land uses which existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the use standards or requirements for the particular district. These are known as nonconforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt an ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The purpose of this section is to provide for the continuation of a nonconforming structure or use, change of a nonconforming structure, and change of a nonconforming use.
(b)
Continuation of a nonconforming structure or use. Subject to the provisions of this section, a nonconforming structure or use may be continued and maintained in reasonable repair, but shall not be altered or extended. The extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a structure which was arranged or designed for the nonconforming use at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not considered an enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use. Alterations or extensions of a nonconforming use may be allowed when the administrative officer determines that such alterations or extensions are necessary to comply with other city, state or federal requirements.
(c)
Change of a nonconforming structure or use.
(1)
Except for signs, a structure conforming as to use but nonconforming as to height, yard requirements, or lot coverage may be altered or extended provided the alteration or extension does not exceed the area, height, or coverage requirements of this chapter. A nonconforming sign shall not be altered or extended except to make it comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(2)
If a nonconforming use involving a structure is replaced by another use, the new use shall conform to this chapter.
(3)
If a nonconforming use involving a residential structure is changed to another residential use, the new use shall be of the same type (i.e. a single-family use can only be changed to another single-family use; a multifamily use can only be changed to another multifamily use, etc.).
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 1500—1502)
Sec. 30-39. - Land use ordinance district map.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to:
(1)
Establish the land use ordinance district map and provide for identification, alteration, and replacement of the district map; and
(2)
Establish criteria to be considered in amending the district map, district boundaries, relationship between district map and future land use map, and newly annexed areas.
(b)
Designation; references to district map. The land use ordinance district map is hereby designated to be section 30-39. Any reference to the "district map" in this article refers to the official land use ordinance district map.
(c)
Identification, alteration, and replacement of the district map.
(1)
The district map is signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk, and bears the seal of the city under the following words: "This certifies that this is the land use ordinance district map referred to in section 30-39 of the Code of the City of Demorest, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(2)
The district map may be altered only if the proposed alterations are in conformance with the future land use map, and sound planning principles. Any alteration to the district map is an amendment to this section, and the procedures applicable to text amendments shall be applicable to such amendments. Any amendment involving changes in performance district boundaries must be entered on the district map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the city council. The entry should be as follows: "On (date) by official action of the city council, the following change (or changes) were made on the official land use ordinance district map: (brief description of change)." It should be signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk. No amendment to portions of this section that are illustrated on the district map becomes effective until after the change has been entered as described above on the district map. Any unauthorized alteration of the district map by any person is a violation of this section. The official land use ordinance district map is located at city hall and is the final authority as to the current status of performance district boundaries.
(3)
If the district map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may adopt a new district map which will replace the previous district map. The new district map is identified as such in the same manner as described above. When the new district map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous district map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new district map was adopted, as a reference aid. The previous district map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference.
(d)
District boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a performance district shown on the district map, the following guidelines should be followed in establishing the exact location of the boundary:
(1)
Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a street or road, or as approximately following the right-of-way line, that line should be considered to be the boundary.
(2)
Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, the corporate limit line should be considered to be the boundary.
(3)
Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line extended should be considered to be the boundary.
(4)
Where a performance district boundary is indicated approximately following the center of a streambed, such should be considered to be the boundary.
(5)
Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the centerline of a street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, such boundary shall be interpreted to be parallel to such line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the district map.
(6)
Where a performance district boundary line is indicated as dividing a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the performance standards for the performance district in which the greater portion of the lot lines must be extended to the balance of the lot up to a distance of 35 feet beyond the actual boundary line of the performance district.
(e)
Relationship between district map and future land use map.
(1)
The future land use map is prepared by the planning commission and adopted by the city council. It should provide the best possible indication of desirable future land use patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. It indicates actual land uses rather than land use intensities or performance districts. Existing land uses need not conform to the future land use map.
(2)
The performance districts contained on the district map carry standards which must be met by all new development and construction in the city. The arrangement of performance districts is based on land use projections depicted on the future land use map. Establishment and amendments of performance district boundaries must be based on defensible findings of fact as well as sound comprehensive planning principles.
(f)
Land use ordinance district map. The city's land use ordinance district map shall be a part of this section. The map shall be located in city hall.

Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for a future land use map, background concepts of the future land use map, identification, alteration, and replacement of the future land use map, and criteria to be considered in amending the future land use map.
(b)
Background concepts of the future land use map. The future land use map represents a synthesis of data concerning population, land use patterns, and economic activity, etc. The planning commission has studied these data and conceived a set of goals to provide suitable space for anticipated future development while the public health, safety, and welfare is protected. The map contains an arrangement of land uses which permits minimum adverse impact on neighboring land uses and on safety conditions, while maximum efficiency in providing community and utility services is achieved. The land uses illustrated on the future land use map represent the planning commission's projection of how land use patterns in the city should look in the medium to long-range future. The performance standards and other requirements contained in this section are intended to encourage the development of the land use patterns depicted on the future land use map. Existing and future land uses are not regulated or controlled by the future land use map as they are by the district map.
(c)
Identification, alteration, and replacement of the future land use map.
(1)
The future land use map is signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk, and bears the seal of the city or that of a notary public under the following words: "This certifies that this is the Demorest Future Land Use Map referred to in section 30-40 of the Code of the City of Demorest, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(2)
The future land use map may be altered only if the proposed alterations are in conformance with sound comprehensive planning principles. Any alteration to the future land use map is an amendment to this section.
(3)
The procedure by which amendments are proposed and approved is contained in section 30-36. Any amendment to the future land use map must be entered on that map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the city council. The entry should be as follows: "On (date), by official action of the city council, the following change (or changes) were made in the Demorest Future Land Use Map: (Brief description of change)." It should be signed by the mayor with the witnessing signature of the city clerk. No amendment to the future land use map becomes effective until after the change and only by the procedures contained in this section. Any unauthorized alteration of the future land use map is a violation of this section.
(4)
The future land use map is located in city hall. If it becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature of number of changes or additions, the city council may adopt a new future land use map, which will replace the previous identified as such in the same manner as described above in this section. When the new future land use map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous future land use map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new future land use map was adopted as a reference aid. The previous future land use map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference.
(d)
