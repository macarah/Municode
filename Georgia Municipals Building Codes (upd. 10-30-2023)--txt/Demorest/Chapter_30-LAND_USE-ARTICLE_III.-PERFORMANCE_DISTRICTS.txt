ARTICLE III. - PERFORMANCE DISTRICTS

Sec. 30-67. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish and explain performance districts used in this chapter, and to divide the city into performance districts.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 200)
Sec. 30-68. - Performance districts established.
For the purpose of this article, the city is divided into performance districts as follows:
(1)
Low-intensity (LI) performance district.
(2)
Moderate-intensity (MI) performance district.
(3)
High-intensity (HI) performance district.
(4)
Sensitive land (SL) performance district.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 201)
Sec. 30-69. - Performance districts explained.
(a)
Performance districts are areas of land within the city which have different performance standards based on maximum lot coverage and minimum open area. Within each district certain land uses may be required to meet buffer and/or screening requirements or conditional use requirements, intended to promote the separation of incompatible uses and retain the character of the community. These standards and requirements allow for the flexibility of mixed land uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial) to exist within the same district.
(b)
Although this article establishes the locations of district boundaries as indicated on the city's land use ordinance district map (district map), the boundaries may be amended in the future in order to meet changing needs, if evidence is presented and accepted in support of such an amendment. This may be done, however, only if the proposed change is in conformance with the city's future land use map. If conditions have changed to the point that a genuinely needed change in a district boundary is not in conformance with the future land use map, then the future land use map must first be amended to address the changing needs. After such action, the proposed amendment to the district boundary of the district map will no longer be in conflict with the future land use map, both will have been kept up-to-date to address current and projected future needs.
(c)
In making the decision to amend the boundary of a performance district, the points contained in section 30-40 must be considered by the planning commission and the city council.

Sec. 30-71. - Low-intensity (LI) performance districts.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish low-intensity (LI) performance districts by defining low-intensity performance districts, features which make land suitable for low-intensity use, permitted uses, and performance standards for low-intensity districts.
(b)
Low-intensity (LI) performance districts defined. Low-intensity performance districts encompass areas with large, undeveloped tracts of land where full city services are not available. Low-intensity districts can include residential and agricultural activities as well as forested areas. It is anticipated that these areas may become more intensely developed in the medium to long-range future as the city grows. At present, however, development will be at a low-intensity level as reflected in the performance standards for low-intensity performance districts.
(c)
Features which make land suitable for low-intensity use.
(1)
Land is best suited for, or is being used for such activities as agriculture, forest management, or residential development.
(2)
Land is away from developed areas of the city. Such lands may be developed in the future, but are outside of existing developed areas.

Sec. 30-74. - Sensitive land (SL) performance districts.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish sensitive land (SL) performance districts by defining sensitive land performance districts, features which make land suitable for sensitive land use, permitted uses, and performance standards for sensitive land districts.
(b)
Sensitive land (SL) performance districts defined. Sensitive land performance districts are intended to prevent hazards and threats to life and property created by flooding, landslides, weak foundation soils, and other hazards as may be identified and mapped by the city or other agency. Building hazards exist throughout the other districts of the city, but specific parcels which lie wholly or partially in an area of identified hazards are considered to be in the sensitive land district. It is the intent of the standards of this section to protect life and property by reducing building intensity in these areas, by requiring special construction techniques, or by requiring the study of such areas by a qualified person prior to construction.
(c)
Features which make land suitable for sensitive land use. Land is suitable for sensitive land use if development hazards are present on the land, such as wetlands, flooding potential, steep slopes, or unstable soils.
(d)
Determining sensitive lands. Current background or technical information should be examined to determine sensitive lands. These include:
(1)
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Flood Hazards Map for Demorest.
(2)
Demorest Topographic Map.
(3)
Soil Survey, Habersham County, Georgia; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service.
(e)
Permitted uses.
(1)
Outright uses. Recreation uses are permitted in a sensitive land (SL) district as long as the requirements of the performance standards are met.
(2)
Conditional uses. Other uses may be permitted in a sensitive land (SL) district as allowed in the use matrix, which appears in section 30-70.
(3)
Amendment of this section. If there is demonstrated and accepted in the future a need to permit other land use activities to be located in a sensitive land district, this section may be amended as provided in section 30-36.
(f)
Performance standards for sensitive land districts.
(1)
The planning commission shall review all planning permit requests for conformance with the standards and criteria of the sensitive land district. The planning commission shall review requests for building permits and/or grading permits, proposed in a sensitive land district. The planning commission may use the advice of the administrative officer or other technically qualified person in reaching their determination on matters requiring use of guidelines, such as slope-density determination. The planning commission may recommend to the city council its approval, denial, or required changes in the proposal based on the criteria of standards of the district. The city council's decision shall be subject to appeal to the county superior court.
(2)
In reviewing applications for subdivisions, planned developments, or multifamily dwellings, the administrative office shall employ the following density guidelines for the property, based on the average slope of the site as determined from the city topographic map or a contour map presented by the applicant:

  (3)
Specific density shall be established after deliberation of the planning commission and testimony from the engineering geologist, soils engineer or other qualified person for proper foundation design, stormwater drainage or retention facilities, vegetation necessary for retention, and adequate placement of roads. Any geologic hazards identified shall be noted and taken into consideration.
(4)
The administrative officer may require a site study by an engineering geologist, soils engineer, or other qualified person prior to issuance of a building or excavation permit in areas containing or adjacent to a landslide, sinkhole, or other geologic hazard. Site studies may also be required for construction or excavation in areas of steep slope, where, in the opinion of the engineering geologist, soils engineer, or other qualified person, there is a hazard to the proposed structure or to any adjacent property.
(5)
Site studies may be required by the administrative officer or planning commission for construction or development of property containing weak foundation soils as determined by the Soil Survey of Habersham County Georgia, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Site studies shall include information on the bearing capacity of the soil, adequacy and method of drainage facilities, and length of fill settlement prior to construction. Location and characteristics of weak foundation soils shall be updated as information becomes available.
(6)
For structures, driveways, parking areas or other impervious surfaces in areas of 25 percent slope and greater, the release rate and sedimentation of stormwater shall be controlled by the use of retention facilities as specified by the U.S. Soil and Conservation Service or other qualified agency. The retention facilities shall be designed for storms having a 25-year recurrence frequency. Stormwater shall be directed into drainages with adequate capacity so as not to flood adjacent or downstream property. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service may be used for technical information.
(7)
In all areas of the city, the administrative officer may require adequate culverts or other drainage facilities be installed as a condition of construction.
(8)
Filling of lowlands shall be done only where it is determined that the fill will not cause the flooding of adjacent properties, and adequate drainage facilities are installed.
