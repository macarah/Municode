In the event that this fire, safety, and health inspection reveals deficiencies which might cause a serious fire, safety, or health threat to the owner or occupant, the owner, occupant, or both of said residential structure shall be required to bring said structure into compliance with fire, safety, and health codes within the prescribed time frame.
(b)
In the event that fire safety code violations are noted during the yearly inspection of existing public buildings, during the inspection of newly built public buildings or remodeled or altered existing public buildings, the fire chief shall give the owner of said building 90 days to correct noted violations; this 90-day period may be reduced at the discretion of the fire chief if the violations noted impose an eminent life safety hazard to the public. At the end of the prescribed timeframe, the fire chief shall return to the structure and conduct a follow-up inspection. This follow-up inspection shall consist of the inspection of the violations noted during the earlier inspection to verify the correction of said violations. If the violations have not been corrected at the time of the follow-up inspection, an additional 30 days shall be given to the owner to correct said violations unless the violation represents an eminent life safety hazard in which no additional time to correct shall be given. At the end of this second prescribed time frame, the fire chief shall return to the property to conduct the second follow-up inspection. The owner, occupant or both of the structure in violation shall be charged a second follow-up inspection fee of $100.00, until changed by ordinance or resolution of the council, for this inspection, and if the earlier noted violations still have not been corrected, the owner, occupant, or both shall either be given additional time and charged another follow-up inspection fee of $200.00, until changed by ordinance or resolution of the council, or the violation report will be turned over to the municipal court judge for appropriate action.
