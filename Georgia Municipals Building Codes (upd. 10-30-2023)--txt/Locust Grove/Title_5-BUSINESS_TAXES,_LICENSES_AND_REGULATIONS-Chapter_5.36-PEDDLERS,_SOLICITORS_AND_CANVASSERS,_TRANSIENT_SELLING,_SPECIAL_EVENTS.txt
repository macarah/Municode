It is unlawful for any person to peddle, solicit, canvass, engage in transient selling as defined in section 536.020 within the corporate limits of the city without first obtaining a license as provided in section 5.36.050 or section 5.36.060.

5.36.020 - Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply and form a part of this chapter:
"Peddler" means any person who travels from place to place by any type of conveyance, carrying his wares with him, offering and exposing the same for sale, or making sales and delivering articles to purchasers, or any person who, without traveling from place to place, sells or offers the same for sale from any type of vehicle or conveyance. A peddler generally offers for sale, consummates the sale, and delivers the goods at one and the same time to the ultimate consumer. Any person who solicits orders and, as a separate transaction, makes deliveries to purchasers as part of a scheme or design to evade the provisions of this definition, shall be deemed peddling and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. The word "peddler" shall not include any person who goes upon private property for the purpose of peddling, having been invited to do so by the owner or occupant of such property.
"Person" means any individual, corporation, partnership, organization or legal entity.
"Solicitor" or "canvasser" means any person who travels from place to place by any type of conveyance taking, or attempting to take orders for the sale at retail of goods, wares and merchandise, or persona; property of any nature whatsoever for future delivery, whether or not such person has, carries or exposes for sale a sample of the subject of such sale, or whether or not he is collecting advance payments on such sales. The term should also include any person requesting and accepting donations of any kind on public property or the public right-of-way. The word "solicitor" or "canvasser" shall not include any person who goes upon private property to solicit or canvass, having been invited to do so by the owner or occupant of such property.
"Special event" means any organized for profit or nonprofit activity having as its purpose entertainment, fundraising, community outreach, recreation, and/or education which takes place on public property or takes place on private property but requires special public services such as the use of parks, public streets, rights-of-way, or sidewalks. Special events are temporary in nature and may include, but are not limited to, activities such as run/walk events, cycling events, street festivals, parades, grand openings, concerts, assemblies, block parties, and certain outdoor promotional events.
"Transient selling" means any person, either as principal or agent, who engages in a temporary business of selling and delivering goods, wares and merchandise from a fixed location with the city and who, in furtherance of such purpose, hires, leases uses or occupies any building, structure, room, apartment, lot, parking lot, street, or other place, whether public or private, within the city, for the exhibition and sale of such goods, wares and merchandise, either privately or at an auction. Any person who engages in transient selling shall not be relieved from complying with the provisions of this chapter by reason of associating himself with any established local dealer, trader, merchant or auctioneer, or by conducting transient selling in connection with, as a part of or in the name of any established local dealer, trader, merchant or auctioneer. In the event that the conduct of any person falls within the definitions of both peddler and transient selling as contained herein, he shall be deemed to be transient selling for the purposes of this chapter.
