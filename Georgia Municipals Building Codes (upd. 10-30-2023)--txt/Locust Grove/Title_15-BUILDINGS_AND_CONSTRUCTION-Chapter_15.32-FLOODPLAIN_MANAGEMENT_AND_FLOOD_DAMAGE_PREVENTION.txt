Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 15-07-028, adopted Aug. 3, 2015, repealed and recreated ch. 15.32 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 15.32 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. 06-05-045.

15.32.010 - Findings of fact.
A.
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B.
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
C.
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
1.
Protect human life and health;
2.
Minimize damage to private property;
3.
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
4.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain the ordinance codified herein and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. No. 15-07-028, §§ 1, 2, 8-3-15)
15.32.020 - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
A.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
B.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
C.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
D.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
E.
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and,
F.
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

"Substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the building should be:
1.
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or
2.
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
a.
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
b.
Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
"Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
"Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

15.32.170 - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
A.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (B) below;
B.
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
C.
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision ("CLOMR") is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the department.
(Ord. No. 15-07-028, §§ 1, 2, 8-3-15)
15.32.180 - Maintenance requirements.
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The department may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the department.

M.
If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones or multiple base flood elevation cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence;
N.
When only a portion of a proposed structure is located within a flood zone or the future conditions floodplain, the entire structure shall meet the requirements of this chapter.
O.
Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be reasonably safe from flooding:
1.
All such proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area:
2.
All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;

A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the department, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above.
A.
Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the department and approved by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
B.
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
C.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Henry County as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
D.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
E.
Variances may be issued by the director for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
F.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
G.
In reviewing such requests, the director and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
H.
Conditions for variances:
1.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
2.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
3.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as twenty-five dollars for each one hundred dollars of insurance coverage provided.
4.
The department shall maintain the records of all variance actions and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
I.
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the director and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
J.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the director and city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
K.
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
