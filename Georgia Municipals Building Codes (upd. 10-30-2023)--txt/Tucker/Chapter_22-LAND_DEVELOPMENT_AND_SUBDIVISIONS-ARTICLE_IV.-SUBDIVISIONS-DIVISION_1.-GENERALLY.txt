Sec. 22-85. - Power and duty of director of community development to hear variances; criteria to be used in deciding variances, and appeals.
(a)
The director of community development, or his designee, has the authority to hear variances. Appeals of the director of community development decision will be heard by the construction board of appeals. The director of community development shall hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of division 3 of article III of this chapter, known as the subdivision regulations of city, where strict application of any regulation enacted in division 3 of article III of this chapter would result in exceptional and undue hardship to the owner of such property. These regulations provide the minimum necessary requirements for subdivisions in city; thus, variances from the requirements of division 3 of article III of this chapter shall be authorized only upon the planning commission making all of the following findings:
(1)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of division 3 of article III of this chapter would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners in the same zoning district;
(2)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for development under any design configuration allowed by these subdivision regulations unless a variance is granted;
(3)
The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute the grant of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other property owners in the zoning district in which the subject property is located;
(4)
The requested variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and
(5)
The requested variance will not in any manner vary the provisions in chapter 46, the city comprehensive plan or the zoning map of city.
(b)
No variance shall be granted by the director of community development to:
(1)
Allow any variance which conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a special land use permit by the mayor and city council;
(2)
Increase the density allowed on the property; or
(3)
Vary the requirements set forth in subdivision V, division 3 of this article.
(c)
Applications for variances must be submitted in writing to the director of community development. Applications shall contain all those materials and documents required by the community development director that are necessary to demonstrate the necessity for the variance and compliance with the requirements of this Code. At a minimum, the variance application must contain a full explanation of the reasons for the variance and must include a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed without the variance and a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed with the variance.
(d)
Applications for variances shall be decided within 60 days after the filing of a complete application for variance. All land development activity associated with a proposed variance shall cease until a final decision on the variance is made by the director of community development. Land development activity that is not related to the proposed variance may continue unabated.
(e)
All decisions by the director of community development approving or disapproving a variance must be issued in writing and must provide the grounds for the decision of the director of community development.
(f)
Appeals of variances shall be made to the construction board of appeals. Any person or entity (i.e., an owner, applicant, adjoining neighbor or a neighbor whose property line is within 1,500 feet of the nearest property line of the proposed subdivision) aggrieved by a variance decision of the director of community development may appeal such decision by filing a petition to the construction board of appeals. Appeals of the decision of the construction board of appeals made by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county.

Sec. 22-86. - Enforcement, violations, and penalties.

General. It shall be the duty of the mayor to enforce this article.
(b)
Violations and penalties. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of these regulations shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction in recorder's court shall be punished as is provided in section 1-7. Each violation of these regulations shall be considered a separate offense. The owner of any structures, buildings, lots or parcels or parts thereof, where anything in violation of these regulations exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(c)
Enforcement. Appropriate actions and proceedings, including the issuance of stop work orders and actions in a court of law, may be taken by the city in law or in equity to prevent any violation of these regulations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises.
