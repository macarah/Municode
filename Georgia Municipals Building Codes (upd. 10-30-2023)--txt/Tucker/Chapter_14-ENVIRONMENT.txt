ARTICLE II. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 14-21. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into storm sewer conveyances.
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to storm sewer system conveyances;
Therefore, the City of Tucker adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the storm sewer system conveyances. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the storm sewer system conveyances is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
