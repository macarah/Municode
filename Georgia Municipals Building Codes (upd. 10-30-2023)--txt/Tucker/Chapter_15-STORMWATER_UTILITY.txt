Chapter 15 - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 15-1. - Findings.
The city council makes the following findings:
(1)
The city is authorized by the supplementary powers provision of the Georgia Constitution, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III(a)(6) to provide a stormwater collection and disposal system throughout the city.
(2)
The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff.
(3)
Stormwater management services and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city.
(4)
The city has obtained stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital.
(5)
Stormwater management services and facilities are needed throughout city because most of those areas are developed. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(6)
The provision of stormwater management services and facilities in the city promotes an essential regulatory purpose by controlling where stormwater runoff flows and how it is disposed, and thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
(7)
Stormwater management services and facilities will provide a specific service to property owners by assisting in the property owner's legal obligation to control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that runoff does not flow upon their neighbors in greater quantities than it would if the property were in an undeveloped state. By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from developed property, the stormwater management system helps prevent damage that would subject a property owner to civil liability.
(8)
The governing authority of the city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith.
(9)
The city staff and professional consultants have studied the need for, management of, and funding for, a stormwater utility. The city staff and the professional engineering and financing feasibility analysis properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city.
(10)
As a result, the city's governing authority finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and facilities, and the city's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city.
