Editor's note— Section 1 of an ordinance adopted June 14, 2012, amended div. 5 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 5, §§ 103-151—103-159, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 103-128, § 128, adopted Jan. 13, 2011.

Sec. 103-151. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Within the city limits, there are buildings and structures that are vacant and pose a danger to the citizens of the city. Vacant structures are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire, accidents, looting, and other unsafe activities that are injurious to the health, safety and welfare of persons who come on or near the property.
(b)
In addition, vacant structures can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Vacant structures can attract and/or cause blight and other harmful effects to surrounding properties through lack of adequate maintenance and security.
(c)
City officials often have difficulty locating the party responsible for the condition of vacant structures, so the city concludes that it is in the best interest of its citizens to impose registration requirements on such properties located within the city.
(d)
Pursuant to the authority granted to the city by its Charter, the Code of Georgia, and its general police powers, the city has determined that it is in the best interest of its citizens and residents to impose requirements for the registration of vacant structures within the city and to ensure such properties are made safe and secure so as to protect the citizens of Loganville, Georgia.
