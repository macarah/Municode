Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include:
(1)
Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials;

(3)
Emergency operations centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and
(4)
Generating plants and other principal points of electric utility lines.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment.
Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during the base flood event.
Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before March 6, 1979.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 6, 1979.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional home site by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the land development project is located.
Start of construction.
(1)
The term "start of construction" means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
(2)
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(3)
Permanent construction does not include:
a.
Initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading or filling;
b.
The installation of streets and/or walkways;
c.
Excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations of the erection of temporary forms;
d.
The installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or shed not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.
Structure means a walled or roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Subdivision means the division of a single lot or parcel of land into two or more lots or parcels for the purpose of sale or development.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. The term also does not include any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pad equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 107-2. - Findings.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed greenspace areas.
(b)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to private property;
(3)
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken of the expense of the general public;
(5)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight;
(6)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(7)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(8)
Insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood-prone area.
(c)
Therefore, the city establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.

(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Walton or Gwinnett County as provided by law.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this chapter are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected my methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance will be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing provisions of this Code.
(2)
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction. Therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall be issued only upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The city manager or designee shall maintain records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

ARTICLE III. - STANDARDS FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 107-69. - Floodplain elevations and boundaries.
(a)
Studied zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish the base flood elevations whenever available.
(b)
For special flood hazard areas and flood-prone areas, the flood elevations shall be determined by a state-registered professional engineer using a method approved by the city.
(c)
The boundaries or limits of the floodplain shall be within 0.5 feet vertical accuracy on the site plan containing existing topographic information.
(Ord. of 5-14-2009)
Sec. 107-70. - Definition of floodway boundary.
(a)
The width of the floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study.
(b)
Following a pre-design conference with the city, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the site plan containing the existing topographic information.
(Ord. of 5-14-2009)
Sec. 107-71. - General standards.
(a)
No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the floodplain that could result in any of the following:
(1)
Raising the base flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed, unless contained in a drainage easement obtained by the developer;
(2)
Reducing the base flood storage capacity. All compensation for storage capacity shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement, and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain, or raising of the base flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than two percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine the volume of flood storage created by raising the base flood elevation;
(3)
Changing the flow characteristics of the waters of the base flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property, for which verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis;
(4)
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities; or
(5)
Resulting in excessive sedimentation.
In all cases effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased.
(b)
All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys which demonstrate general conformance to the approved designs as submitted in the CLOMR application. A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of one inch equals 1,000 feet. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut-and-fill grading done as a part of the development.
(Ord. of 5-14-2009)
Sec. 107-72. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments.
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb the floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently-registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the city. Cross sections, which may be supplemented by the applicant, and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun within the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to demonstrate that floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
If changes to the base flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed base flood elevations; and
(5)
A preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as applicable, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments.
(Ord. of 5-14-2009)
Sec. 107-73. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(2)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued by FEMA.
(Ord. of 5-14-2009)
Sec. 107-74. - Maintenance requirements.
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of the floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The city may direct the property owner at no cost to the city to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.
