(b)
In the event that any City employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such employee shall use such employee's discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in such employee's discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the Mayor. If, in such employee's discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the Mayor, who may, in the Mayor's discretion, determine that no further action is necessary. If the Mayor in the Major's discretion determines that further action is necessary, a City employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the Mayor:
