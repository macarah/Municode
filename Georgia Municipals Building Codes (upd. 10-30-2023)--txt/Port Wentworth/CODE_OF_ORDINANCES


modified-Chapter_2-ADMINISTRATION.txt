Sec. 2-54. - Definitions.
modified
Accrual basis. The basis of accounting under which revenues and recorded when earned or when levies are made, and expenditures are recorded as soon as they result in liabilities, notwithstanding that the receipt of the revenue or payment of the expenditure may take place, in whole or in part, in another accounting period.

Appropriation balance. Unencumbered balance of appropriation or allotment, and unexpended balance of appropriation or allotment.
Assets. Property of all kinds of a government, including both current assets and fixed assets.
Audit. The examination of records, documents, reports, systems or internal control, accounting and financial procedures, and other evidence for one (1) or more of the following purposes:
(a)
To ascertain whether the statements prepared from the accounts present fairly the financial position and the results of financial operations of the constituent funds and balanced account groups of the governmental unit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals applicable to governmental units and on a basis consistent with that of the preceding years;
(b)
To determine the propriety, legality, and mathematical accuracy of a government unit's financial transactions;
(c)
To ascertain whether all financial transactions have been properly recorded; and
(d)
To ascertain the stewardship of public officials who handle and are responsible for the financial resources of a governmental unit.
Balance sheet. A statement ordinarily prepared from books kept by double entry showing assets, liabilities, reserves and surplus of a fund of a governmental unit at a specified date properly classified to exhibit financial position of the fund or unit at the date.
Budgetary control. The control or management of a governmental unit in accordance with an approved budget and keeping expenditures within the limitations of available appropriations or revenues.
Cash basis. The system of accounting under which revenues are accounted for only when received in cash, and expenditures are accounted for only when paid.
Contingent account. An appropriation to provide for unforeseen expenditures.
Current surplus. The excess of the current assets of a fund over its current liabilities and reserves.
Debit and credit. Terms commonly used to indicate the manner in which a transaction is to be recorded. Every entry on the left side of the ledger sheet is called a "debit." Every entry on the right side of the ledger sheet is called a "credit." We debit in order to record:
(1)
An increase in expenditure or a decrease in revenue;
(2)
A decrease in an asset;
(3)
An increase in a liability.
Debt service. The amount of money necessary annually to pay the interest on the outstanding debt and the principal of maturing bonded debt not payable from a sinking fund and to provide a fund for the redemption of bonds payable from a sinking fund.
Delinquent taxes. Taxes remaining unpaid on and after the date on which a penalty for nonpayment is attached. Even though the penalty may be subsequently waived and a portion of the taxes may be abated or canceled, the unpaid balances continue to be delinquent taxes until abated, canceled, or converted into tax liens.

Internal audit. An audit made by persons on the staff on the governmental unit whose accounts are being audited primarily for the purpose of internal control. Note: An internal audit is usually a continuous audit.
Liabilities. Liabilities are debts owed.
Millage. A term used to express the property tax rate and derived from the term "mill," which is one-tenth of a cent ($0.001). Thus, ten (10) mills equal one cent ($0.01) or one (1) per cent.
0.001 = 1 mill or 1/10 cent;c; 0.010 = 10 mills or 1 cent = 1%;c; 0.100 = 100 mills or 10 cents = 10%
Millage is determined by dividing the total amount of money to be raised by the total assessed value of the district.

Taxes needed       = $100,000
Assessed value       = $8,000,000
$100,000;l; $8,000,000       = .0125 or 12½ mills or 1.25%

(Ord. No. 01-03, 3-8-01)
Sec. 2-70. - Investment policies and procedures.
(1)
Scope. This investment policy applies to activities of the City of Port Wentworth with regards to investing the financial assets of its funds (the city does not manage its own pension trust fund). These funds are accounted for in the city's annual financial report and include:
•
General Fund
•
Special Revenue Funds
•
Capital Projects Funds
•
Propriety Funds
•
Other funds which may be created from time to time
(2)
Objectives. The City of Port Wentworth's investment objectives in order of priority are:
(a)
Safety of principal. Each investment transaction will be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. The City of Port Wentworth will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by:
1.
Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in subsection (6) of this investment policy; and
2.
Diversifying the investment portfolio so that the losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio.
Interest rate risk, the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will decrease due to changes in market interest rates, will be minimized by:
1.
Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities prior to maturity; and
2.
Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools and limiting the average maturity of the portfolio in accordance with this policy.
(b)
Maintenance of adequate liquidity. The investment portfolio must be structured in such a manner that it provides sufficient liquidity to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands.
(c)
Return on investment. The city seeks to attain market rates of return on its investments consistent with constraints imposed by its safety objectives, cash flow considerations and state laws that restrict the placement of certain public funds. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investment is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall generally be held until maturity with the following exceptions:
•
A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal.
•
A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio.
•
Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
(d)
Legality. The City of Port Wentworth's funds will be invested in compliance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and in accordance with these policies and written administrative procedures.
(3)
Standards of care.
(a)
Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy.
The "prudent person" standard states that, "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived."
(b)
Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the City of Port Wentworth.
(c)
Delegation of authority. The Port Wentworth City Council shall establish the overall investment policies, the management and implementation of which is delegated to the assistant city administrator, who shall establish procedures for the operation of the investment program. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the assistant city administrator. The assistant city administrator shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.
(4)
Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. It is the policy of the City of Port Wentworth to purchase securities only from those broker-dealers and banks that are included on the city's bid list as approved by the assistant city administrator. The approved list will be developed in accordance with these investment policies.
Repurchase agreements will be conducted only with those banks and broker-dealers who have executed a master repurchase agreement with the city. All repurchase agreements must be in written form using the Public Securities Association master repurchase agreement as a guide. Annex I of the guide shall materially conform to the recommendations by the Government Finance Officers Association. Agreements not substantially conforming to the master [repurchase agreement] and Annex I are not acceptable.
Broker/dealers will be required to sign a broker-dealer questionnaire certification.
(5)
Safekeeping and custody.
(a)
Delivery vs. payment. All trades of marketable securities will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds.
(b)
Safekeeping. Securities will be held by an independent third-party custodian selected by the entity as evidenced by safekeeping receipts in the City of Port Wentworth's name.
(c)
Internal controls. The assistant city administrator is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City of Port Wentworth are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal controls shall address the following points:
1.
Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two (2) or more employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer.
2.
Separation of functions. By separating key functions and having different people perform each function, each person can perform a "check and balance" review of the other people in the same area.
3.
Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping. By separating the person who authorizes or performs the transaction from the people who record or otherwise account for the transaction, a good separation of duties is achieved.
4.
Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or dealer, including appropriate collateral, should be placed into a third party bank for custodial safekeeping.
5.
Avoidance of bearer-form securities. Bearer-form securities are much easier to convert to personal use than securities that are registered in the name of the City of Port Wentworth.
6.
Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book entry securities are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery is never taken. Physical delivery securities must be properly safeguarded as are any valuable documents. The potential of fraud and loss increases with physical delivery securities.
7.
Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members. Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority and responsibilities to avoid any improper actions. Clear delegation of authority also preserves the internal control structure that is built around the various staff positions and their respective responsibilities.
8.
Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and wire transfers. Due to the potential for errors and improprieties arising from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by written communications and approved by the appropriate person.
9.
Documentation of transactions and strategies.
10.
Development of a wire transfer agreement with the city's lead bank. This agreement should outline the various controls and security provisions for making and receiving wire transfers.
(6)
Suitable and authorized investments. The following investments will be permitted by this policy as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4:
•
Obligations of the State of Georgia or of other states.
•
U.S. Treasury obligations (bills, notes and bonds).
•
Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency.
•
Obligations of the following United States government agencies:
-
Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB)
-
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)
-
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) or its banks
-
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)
-
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) participation certificates or debentures
-
Student Loan Marketing Association
•
Repurchase agreements backed by the United States government or a government agency.
•
The local government investment pool.
•
Obligations of other political subdivisions of the State of Georgia.
•
Time deposits and savings deposits of banks organized under the laws of Georgia or the United States government and operating in Georgia.
-
Savings accounts
-
Money market accounts
-
Certificates of deposits (nonnegotiable type)
(7)
Investment parameters.
(a)
Diversification. The investments shall be diversified by:
1.
Limiting investments to avoid over concentration in securities from a specific issuer or business sector (excluding U.S. Treasury securities);
2.
Limiting investment in securities that have higher credit risks;
3.
Investing in securities with varying maturities; and
4.
Continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available funds such as local government investment pools (LGIPs), money market funds or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in order to meet ongoing obligations.
5.
No more than forty (40) per cent of the entire invested portfolio may be placed with any one (1) bank or security dealer.
(b)
Maximum maturities. The longer the maturity of a particular investment, the greater its susceptibility to market price and credit losses. The city seeks to eliminate such risk by maintaining conservative maturities that are within guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). These guidelines generally recommend avoiding securities with maturities beyond five (5) years unless the investment is matched and held to a specific maturity. Investment maturities shall be scheduled to coincide with projected cash flow needs, taking into consideration large routine expenditures (i.e. payroll and bond payments) as well as anticipated revenues (i.e. property tax collections).
(c)
Active secondary markets. Although many securities are acceptable for investing using the legal authorized list, some are not very desirable from a liquidity standpoint. Accordingly, although investments may be on the authorized list, only those securities with an active secondary market may be purchased from that list.
(8)
Policy considerations.
(a)
Exemption. Any investment currently held that does not meet the guidelines of this policy shall be exempted from the requirements of this policy. At maturity or liquidation, such monies shall be reinvested only as provided by this policy.
(b)
Amendments. This policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis. Any changes must be approved by the assistant city administrator and the city council.
(9)
Approval of investment policy. The investment policy shall be formally approved and adopted by the Port Wentworth City Council and reviewed annually.
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(I—IX), 9-22-05)

(i)
The permanent place of residence of an individual in the armed forces.

(j)
Absence of an individual from his residence because of duty in the armed forces shall not be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption.

Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent in the armed forces;

(n)
Absence of an individual from such individual's residence because of health reasons shall not in and of itself be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption if all other qualifications are otherwise met. Any member of the immediate family of the individual or a friend of the individual may notify the tax receiver or the tax commissioner of the individual's absence. Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent for health reasons.
(3)

(4)
The exemption established herein shall apply only to municipal ad valorem taxes.
