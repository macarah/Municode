Section 4.300 - Conditional uses.
4.310 - General provisions.
Amended by Ordinance of 02-25-2020 (1)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for uses that are generally compatible with the use characteristics of land use standards districts, but which require individual review of their location, design, intensity, configuration, and public facility impact in order to determine the appropriateness of the use on any particular site in the district and their compatibility with adjacent uses. Conditional uses may require the imposition of additional conditions to make the uses compatible in their specific contexts.
Authority. The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission may recommend and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may, in accordance with the procedures, standards and limitations of this ordinance, grant conditional use permits for those uses enumerated in each of the land use standards districts in Table 4 of this ordinance.
4.311 - Persons entitled to initiate actions.
An application for a conditional use may only be submitted by the owner or any other person having a contractual interest in the parcel of land proposed for conditional use.
4.312 - Standards of review.
A conditional use permit shall be granted only if the applicant demonstrates the following:
(1)
Consistency with local ordinances and comprehensive plan. The proposed conditional use is in compliance with all requirements, and is consistent with the general purpose, goals, objectives and standards, of this ordinance, the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan, and the Code of Ordinances of Thomas County; and is in compliance with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provisions of this ordinance authorizing such use.
(2)
Effect on nearby properties.
(a)
The proposed conditional use will not have an undue adverse effect upon adjacent or nearby property.
(b)
The proposed conditional use is compatible with the existing or planned character of the neighborhood in which it would be located.
(c)
All reasonable steps have been taken to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed conditional use on the immediate vicinity through building design, site design, landscaping, and screening.
(d)
The proposed conditional use will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to interfere with the development and use of neighboring property, in accordance with applicable district regulations.
(3)
Adequacy of public facilities. The proposed conditional use will be served by adequate public facilities and services including roads, police protection, fire protection, waste disposal, water, sewer, and drainage.
(4)
Environmental impact. The proposed conditional use will not have a significantly adverse impact on the natural environment.
4.313 - Conditions on conditional use permits.
Amended by Ordinance of 02-25-2020 (1)
The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission may recommend and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions, limitations, and requirements to a conditional use permit as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of Section 4.310; to carry out the spirit and purpose of this ordinance and the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan; and to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property in the neighborhood, including but not limited to limitations on size, intensity of use, bulk and location, landscaping, lighting, the provision of adequate ingress and egress, duration of the permit, and hours of operation. Such conditions shall be set forth expressly in the resolution granting the conditional use permit.
(1)
Traffic control devices. Whenever, as the result of traffic generated by a proposed conditional use, it is determined, based on the manual on uniform traffic control devices, that there is a need to install traffic control devices (including traffic signals, signing, and pavement markings), the conditional use permit shall not be granted except upon the condition that the applicant be responsible for installing all said devices and signs, or make an equitable contribution toward such installation.
(2)
Towers.
1.
Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
a.
Alternative tower structure shall mean manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.

g.
Tower shall mean any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one (1) or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like.
2.
Applicability.
a.
District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
b.
Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners.
c.
Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna that is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
d.
Pre-existing towers and antennas. All towers shall meet the requirements of subsection 4.D.3. of this section.
3.
General guidelines and requirements.
a.
Purpose; goals. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this ordinance are to: (i) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, (ii) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and (v) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
b.
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
c.
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the Planning and Zoning Department an inventory of existing towers that are either in the jurisdiction of the Thomas County Board of Commissioners or within one-quarter (¼) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Planning and Zoning Department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the Thomas County Board of Commissioners, provided, however that the Planning and Zoning Department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
d.
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection (3)d. shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required the Thomas County Board of Commissioners requires shielded dual mode lighting or focused lens-white during daytime hours and red at night.
e.
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia.
f.
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia.
g.
Height requirements. No tower shall exceed a height of three hundred fifty feet (350) feet.
h.
Setbacks. All towers shall be set back from any adjoining property line a distance of the tower height.
i.
Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
j.
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive such requirements if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby.
1.
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
2.
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
3.
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
4.
Conditional uses.
A.
General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits for towers:
1.
In granting a conditional use permit, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may impose conditions to the extent the Thomas County Board of Commissioners concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.

Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permits, although the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or more of the criteria if the Thomas County Board of Commissioners, concludes that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby.
A.
Height of the proposed tower;
B.
Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries;
C.
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
D.
Surrounding topography;
E.
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
F.
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and
G.
Proposed ingress and egress; and
H.
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection 3.c.
I.
Carrier utilization of tower(s).
6.
Administrative.
A.
General.
(1)
Each applicant applying for a conditional use for towers shall adhere to application procedures as required in Section 4.320, Application Procedures, providing the information set forth in subsections 4.B. and 4.C.
(2)
Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Thomas County Board of Commissioners notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may, in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(3)
Access improvements. A conditional use permit shall not be granted except upon the condition that the applicant provides the access (ingress and egress) improvements determined to be necessary as a result of traffic generated by the development.
(4)
Projects requiring other regulatory approvals. For proposed conditional uses requiring any permit from any local state, or federal regulatory authority, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall not grant unconditionally a conditional use permit until the commission has received from such authority notice of either issuance or of intent to issue the required regulatory permit.
(5)
Conditional approval. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners may grant a conditional use permit contingent upon receiving notice of either issuance of or intent to issue any required regulatory permit if it can make, on a tentative basis and subject to confirmation, the findings required in Section 4.312. A conditional use permit granted contingent upon receiving notice of either issuance of or intent to issue any required regulatory permit shall not preclude the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission, after reviewing the regulatory permit application and other information, from revoking such contingent grant of a conditional use permit based solely upon an inability to confirm the findings required in Section 4.312 or from protesting the regulatory permit application.
(6)
Reduction in maximum residential density. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall require a reduction from the maximum residential density permitted in the land use standards district in which a conditional use is to be located when such allowable maximum residential density would impose an excessive burden, as determined by recognized engineering or other professional standards, on public facilities that would serve the proposed conditional use.
4.320 - Application procedures.
4.321 - Pre-application conference.
An application for conditional use is initiated by requesting in writing a pre-application conference with the Planning Director. The request shall include a description of the character, location, and magnitude of the proposed conditional use, together with a proposed timetable for development. The purpose of this meeting is to acquaint the applicant with the requirements of this ordinance and the views and concerns of the County when positions are flexible. Within twenty (20) days of the request, the Planning Director shall schedule a pre-application conference between himself, the applicant, and any other official of other relevant County departments.
4.322 - Filing application for conditional use permit.
(1)
Filing. After the pre-application conference, an applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit an application to the Planning Director accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as established from time to time by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners to defray the actual cost of processing the application.

4.350 - Existing conditional uses.
A legally conforming use that exists on the effective date of this ordinance and that is permitted as a conditional use in a land use standards district shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in that district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. A use existing prior to its present classification by this ordinance as a conditional use may change in use or in lot area or may alter a structure only if the change or alteration conforms to the requirements of Section 4.330 for conditional uses. Such change or alteration may be accomplished only pursuant to the standards and procedures established for the adjustment of a conditional use as set forth in Section 4.330.

Amended by Ordinance of 02-25-2020 (1)
(1)
Authority . The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission shall recommend and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall have authority to grant variances from the requirements of Sections 3.216 (except no variance shall be granted for residential or commercial construction on property that is located on an easement), and 3.222, and 3.223 in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this section.
(2)
Purpose . The purpose of a variance is to provide a mechanism when, owing to special conditions, the literal enforcement of the regulations of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 that impose upon a landowner unnecessary hardship can be mitigated without conferring on the applicant any special privilege.
(3)
Initiation . An owner of or any person having contractual interest in the property to be affected by the variance may seek a variance under the provisions of this section.
(Amd. of 10-13-98; Res. of 4-24-18)
4.420 - Standards for granting variances.
The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall not grant a variance unless it shall, in each case, make specific findings of fact based directly upon the particular evidence presented to it which support written conclusions that:
(1)
The variance requested· arises from a condition that is unique and peculiar to the land, structures, and buildings involved; that the particular physical surroundings, the shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved, would result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee, or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 are literally enforced; that it is a condition that is not ordinarily found in the same land use standards district, and the condition is created by the regulations of Sections 3.216, 3.222, 3.223 of this ordinance, and not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same land use standards district under the terms of this ordinance.
(3)
The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located, nor impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
(4)
The granting of the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to similar lands, structures, or buildings in the same land use standards district.
(5)
The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structures; and
(6)
The variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of this ordinance of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan.
(Amd. of 10-13-98; Res. of 4-24-18)
4.430 - Limitations on variances.
(1)
No variance shall be granted which would permit a use or structure contrary to the use provisions of Section 3.270.1 and Table 4.
(2)
No variance from the provisions of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless a building permit is issued and construction is started pursuant thereto.
(Res. of 4-24-18)
4.440 - Procedures for application.
(1)
Application. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Planning Director accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, as established from time to time by the Board of Commissioners to defray the actual cost of processing the application. The application shall be in such form and shall contain such information and documentation as shall be prescribed from time to time by the Planning Director and shall contain at least the following:

(2)
Filing and application for approval of a variance. Within five (5) working days after an application for approval of a variance is submitted, the Planning Director shall determine whether the application is complete. If the Planning Director determines that the application is not complete, he shall send a written statement specifying the application's deficiencies to the applicant by mail. The Planning Director shall take no further action on the application unless the deficiencies are remedied.

Section 4.600 - Inter-governmental land use classification dispute resolution process.
1.
Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification(s) (if applicable) of the property.
Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the above information, the county will forward to the city a statement either: (a) indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property; or (b) describing its bona fide objection(s) to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objection(s);
2.
If the County has no objection to the City's proposed land use or zoning classification, the City is free to proceed with the annexation. If the County fails to respond to the City's notice in writing within the deadline, the City is free to proceed with the annexation and the County loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation.
3.
If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the city will respond to the county in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: (a) agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolve the county's objection(s); (b) agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; (c) disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are bona fide, the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue(s).
4.
If the City initiates mediation, the City and County will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants in the mediation. The City and County agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation.

An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process.
6.
However, the final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the governing body considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding, a government may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.
