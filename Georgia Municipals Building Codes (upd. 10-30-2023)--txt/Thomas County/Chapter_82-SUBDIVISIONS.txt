Safety flared ends will be installed on all new driveway installations on paved roads, with the exception of platted, paved subdivision roads classified as "minor" roads, defined herein and classified by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners as a low volume, low speed, residential road that primarily serves the residents of the subdivision. A subdivision road or street that may be used as a cut through or connector road to a main road may not be considered a "minor" road. There may be areas in which larger drainage structures are necessary requiring flared ends. This decision will be at the discretion of the public works director. Paved subdivision roads classified as "minor" may have masonry or other type vertical walls constructed by the property owner or their contractor so long as the walls conform to the existing regulations as stated in the Thomas County Right-of-Way Encroachment Ordinance, adopted May 14, 2002, that specifies the walls shall not extend beyond the height of the driveway or come within four and one-half feet of the edge of pavement. Thomas County does not accept maintenance responsibility for these vertical wall structures.
