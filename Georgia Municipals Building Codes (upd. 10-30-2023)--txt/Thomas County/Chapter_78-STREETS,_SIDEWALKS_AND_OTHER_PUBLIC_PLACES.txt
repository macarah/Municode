Roads that do not meet all specifications for the construction of a "new road" may be accepted by the county commission for inclusion in the county public road system provided that they are offered by the property owners fronting the roads under the following terms and conditions:
(1)
The property adjoining the private road must be at least 50 percent developed. The required development herein shall be determined by the following formula: The front footage of all lots or parcels adjacent to the street, road, curb or sidewalk being installed or improved shall be totaled, and the total footage of all lots or parcels shall be divided into the total front footage of all lots or parcels with improvements thereon to arrive at the percentage of development.
(2)
If the private road meets the development threshold, a petition to have the road accepted by the county shall be presented to the director of public works. The petition must be signed by 75 percent of the owners of the property abutting the private road based upon front footage and the owners of 75 percent of the front footage.
(3)
Upon receipt of the petition, the director of public works shall determine that the signatures conform to ownership as shown in the public records of the clerk of the superior court of Thomas County and that the requisite 75 percent have signed the petition.
(4)
After verifying the petition, the director of public works shall prepare a new petition showing legal ownership of the property abutting the road and the maximum cost to be assessed to each parcel. This petition shall be executed by the requisite percentage of property owners.
(c)
The completed and executed petition will be presented to the board by the public works director. Upon acceptance of the road by the board of commissioners, the county manager shall cause the assessments to be made against the property fronting the road and notify the tax collector by county tax map parcel number of the amount to be assessed against each parcel to recover the property owners share of the cost. In addition, the county manager shall place a paving assessment against each parcel and its owner in the public records of the office of the clerk of the superior court which shall be placed in the official deed records of the county.
