Sec. 9-3-1. - Regulation of pawnbrokers.
The following words and terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes of this chapter:
Pawnbroker: Any person engaged, in whole or in part, in the business of lending money on the security of pledged goods; or engaged in the business of purchasing tangible personal property on condition that it may be redeemed or repurchased by the seller for a fixed price within a fixed period of time; or engaged, as part of the business activities described above or in conjunction therewith, in the business of purchasing tangible personal property from persons or sources other than manufacturers or licensed dealers.
Person: An individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, trust, association or any other legal entity however organized.
Pledged goods: Tangible personal property, including, without limitation, all types of motor vehicles or any motor vehicle certificate of title, which property is purchased by, deposited with, or otherwise actually delivered into the possession of a pawnbroker in connection with a pawn transaction. However, for purposes of this Code section, possession of any motor vehicle certificate of title which has come into the possession of a pawnbroker through a pawn transaction made in accordance with law shall be conclusively deemed to be possession of the motor vehicle and the pawnbroker shall retain physical possession of the motor vehicle certificate of title for the entire length of the pawn transaction, but shall not be required in any way to retain physical possession of the motor vehicle at any time. "Pledged goods" shall not include choses in action, securities, or printed evidences of indebtedness.

Sec. 9-3-2. - License required.
No person shall conduct business as a pawnbroker, or maintain an establishment for the purposes of conducting business as a pawnbroker, until a business license has been obtained from the city clerk. Such license application shall be made to the city clerk and license issued only upon approval by the mayor and council.
(Code 1959, § 12A-3)
Sec. 9-3-3. - Review of application.

Sec. 9-3-4. - Limitation on issuance.
(a)
No pawnbroker's license shall be issued to any person or to any pawnbroker who employs any person who has been convicted of a crime involving as an element thereof the theft of property.
(b)
No further pawnbrokers licenses shall be issued when the total number of licenses issued and in effect would number more than one (1) for each eight thousand (8,000) persons residing in the city. It is the intent of this provision to require a population of eight thousand (8,000) persons for each license issued. For purposes of complying with this Code section, the most recent decennial census of the United States as published by the United States Bureau of the Census shall be used. Example: (1) population equals less than eight thousand (8,000), then no license may be issued; (2) population equals eight thousand (8,000) to fifteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (15,999), then one (1) license may be issued; (3) population equals sixteen thousand (16,000) to twenty-three thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (23,999), then two (2) licenses may issued, etc. If a licensee shall go out of business or if a license is revoked and the number of such licenses in effect shall continue to exceed the limit prescribed herein, such license may not be reinstated.

(Ord. No. 94-005, 12-19-94)
Sec. 9-3-14. - Moratorium on the licensing of pawnbrokers.
(a)
Findings of fact. The mayor and council of the City of Forest Park hereby makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
It appears that the city ordinance on business licensure, as it relates to pawnbrokers and pawn shops, requires an additional review by the City of Forest Park;
(2)
Substantial disorder, detriment and irreparable harm would result to the citizens, businesses and City of Forest Park if the current regulatory for pawnbrokers and pawn shops in the city were to be utilized prior to more thorough review;
(3)
The city's ongoing revision of the aforementioned licensure and regulation provisions requires that a cessation of pawn licensing be enacted; and
(4)
That it is necessary and in the public interest to delay, for a reasonable period of time, the processing of any applications for such businesses, to ensure that the design, development and location of the same are consistent with the long-term planning objectives of the city.
(b)
Imposition of moratorium:
(1)
There is hereby imposed a moratorium on the issuance by the staff of the City of Forest Park of development plans, and permits and licenses for all pawn shops and pawn brokerages seeking to operate in the City of Forest Park.
(2)
The duration of this moratorium shall be until such time as the city completes the hereinafter described studies and takes any appropriate action thereon, including, without limitation, revocation, or the expiration of thirty (30) days from enactment, whichever first occurs.
(3)
This moratorium shall be effective as of the date of this section.
(4)
This moratorium shall have no effect upon approvals or permits previously issued or as to development plans previously approved by the city. The provisions of this section shall not affect the issuance of permits or licenses that have received preliminary or final approval by the city on or before the effective date of this section.
(5)
As of the effective date of this section, no applications for operation of a pawn shop or pawn brokerage business will be accepted by any agent, employee or officer of the city with respect to any property in the City of Forest Park and any application so accepted for filing will be deemed in error, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.
(6)
The city shall immediately commission a review of its ordinances concerning pawn shop and pawn brokerage licensure.
(7)
The city shall, after completion of the study, make such changes or additions to the city's ordinances as its studies may warrant.
(8)
The following procedures shall be put in place immediately. Under the Supreme Court case of Cannon v. Clayton County, 255 Ga. 63 (1985), the Supreme Court stated,
"Where a landowner makes a substantial change in position by expenditures and reliance on the probability of the issuance of a building permit, based upon an existing zoning ordinance and the assurances of zoning officials, he acquires vested rights and is entitled to have the permit issued despite a change in the zoning ordinance which would otherwise preclude the issuance of a permit." Pursuant to this case, the City of Forest Park recognizes that, unknown to the city, de facto vesting may have occurred. The following procedures are established to provide exemptions from the moratorium where vesting has occurred:
a.
A written application, including verified supporting data, documents and facts, may be made requesting a review by the mayor and council at a scheduled meeting of any facts or circumstances which the applicant feels substantiates claim for vesting and the grant of an exemption;
b.
Within one (1) week of the enactment of this moratorium, the city shall cause to issue an advertisement in its legal newspaper to run once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks providing notice to the public of the imposition of this moratorium and the opportunity for review before the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 98-002, § I, 2-26-98)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 98-002, adopted Feb. 26, 1998, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, Codification of § I of said ordinance as § 9-3-14 herein was at the editor's discretion.
Sec. 9-3-15. - Pawnbroker's license transferrable.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Code, a pawnbroker duly licensed by, and in good standing with, the City of Forest Park may transfer his pawnbroker's license to another person as follows:
(1)
The holder of the pawnbroker's license shall notify the mayor and council in writing of its desire and intent to transfer its pawnbroker's license, and attach to such notice a completed license application of the intended transferee, including a check for the license fee from the intended transferee.
(2)
The chief of police shall review and investigate the intended transferee's application, using the same standards as are used for initial applications and forward his recommendation thereon to the mayor and council for their consideration, approval or denial.
(3)
Upon approval of the intended transferee by the mayor and council, the city clerk shall have authority to amend the existing pawnbroker's license to reflect the transfer.
(b)
Any misrepresentation on the intended transferee's license application shall be grounds for rejection of the application for transfer.
(Ord. No. 98-010, § 1, 6-15-98)
