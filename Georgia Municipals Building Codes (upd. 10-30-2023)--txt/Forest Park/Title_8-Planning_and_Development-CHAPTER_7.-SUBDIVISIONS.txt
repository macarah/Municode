ARTICLE H. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 8-7-91. - Purposes.
The purposes of this article include the following:
(1)
To provide one or more residential zoning districts that permit flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(2)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(3)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
(4)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(5)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
(6)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
(7)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
(8)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
(9)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
(10)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
(11)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(12)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.

Sec. 8-7-92. - General regulations.
(a)
Applicability of regulations. This conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right in all residential zoning districts, including [list of applicable zoning districts]. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.
(b)
Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(c)
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two (2) methods, at the discretion of the City of Forest Park:
(1)
Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
Slopes over twenty-five (25) percent of at least five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area;
b.
The 100-year floodplain;
c.
Bodies of open water over five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area; and
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Clean Water Act; or
e.
Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities.
(2)
Yield plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
(Ord. No. 07-12, § 1, 3-19-2007)
Sec. 8-7-93. - Application requirements.

Provides for enforcement of the plan.
(3)
In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, then the City of Forest Park may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the owner, the homeowner's association, or to the individual property owners that make up the homeowner's association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties.
(f)
Legal instrument for permanent protection.
(1)
The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one (1) of the following:
a.
A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
(i)
A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out is functions; or
(ii)
A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this article.
If the entity accepting the easement is not the City of Forest Park, then a third right of enforcement favoring the City of Forest Park shall be included in the easement.
