(3)
To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in matters coming before the city; and

To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.

It is the intent of this chapter that city officials shall avoid any action, whether or not specifically prohibited by section 2-2-5 of this chapter, which might result in, or create the appearance of the following:

Using public office for private gain;
(2)
Impeding government efficiency or economy; or
