Purpose.

The city council further finds that certain aspects of development, such as the spatial relationships of structures and open spaces to each other and the appearance of buildings and open spaces as they contribute to the attractiveness, function, and character of a district or the city as a whole, require the timely exercise of judgment in the public interest by a public body qualified to evaluate the design of proposed new developments or redevelopments within the city.
(b)
Declaration of public policy. It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that the identification, protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of places, districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects, landscape features and works of art of special character of a special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of health, prosperity, safety, education and general welfare of the people. It is further declared as a matter of public policy that the promotion of sound design principals, in order to provide a built environment which is attractive and functional, is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, education and general welfare of the people. Accordingly, the public policy objectives of this division are as follows:

(6)
To improve the environment of the city and quality of life for the general welfare of all citizens of the city;

Sec. 36-69. - Design standards.
(a)
Visual compatibility factors. New construction and existing buildings, structures and appurtenances attached thereto which are moved, reconstructed, materially altered, repaired or repainted, including repainting the same color, should reflect the visual character of the surrounding areas and shall be visually compatible with buildings, and places to which they are visually related generally, in terms of the following factors:
(1)
Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually compatible with and complement the adjacent buildings and structures.
(2)
Scale. The size of a building should be similar in height, width and depth to buildings, squares and places to which it is visually related, except in areas of redevelopment.
(3)
Facades. Buildings should follow an established solid-to-void ratio and are to be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. Windows and door openings (height and width) are to be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. Avoid openings exceeding the dimensions of adjacent buildings by more than ten percent. Buildings must have finished front, side and rear elevations where there is visibility to those elevations. Respect and preserve the existing vernacular architecture and its elements.
(4)
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of buildings to open spaces between the building and the adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(5)
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship of entrances and porch projections to the sidewalks of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(6)
Materials, texture and color. The compatibility of the materials, texture and colors for each facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related. Buildings and structures shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. Buildings adjacent to each other of conflicting architectural styles shall be separated by such means as screens and site breaks.
(7)
Roof configuration and shape. The roof configuration and shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the building to which it is visually related.
(8)
Continuity. Appurtenances of a building such as walls, wrought iron, fences, evergreen landscape masses and building facades shall, if necessary, form cohesive walls of enclosure along a street, to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(9)
Signs. Signs shall be compatible with the buildings and places to which they are visually related. Signs shall reflect the scale and character of their surroundings in size, type, face, graphics, lighting, square footage, style, material, color and related qualities of the building.
a.
Ground-mounted signage in all districts are to be monument style with materials and a color to match the parent building's materials. Unless otherwise specified in a master sign plan, the structural supports and foundation shall be of brick, stone or of materials to match the principal material found in the principal structure on the site. The board encourages seasonal and evergreen plants installed in planting beds surrounding the monument sign.
b.
All signs must be weatherproof and must be made of enduring materials so as not to become a hazard due to disrepair, damage or inclement weather. All letters or numbers shall be permanently affixed. Neon, fiber optics, and non-traditional illumination techniques are discouraged in lieu of LED or more environmentally friendly styles. Use of neon tubing, fiber optics or other non-traditional illumination techniques which are visible are prohibited unless covered by translucent material. All signs shall provide vertical relief with the use of characters, letters or numbers. Lighting should be limited and shall not be distractive to motorists or pedestrians, or distract from the architecture of the site.
c.
In general:
1.
Individual signs should not use more than two colors, plus a background color.
2.
Signage may also utilize white and/or black as predominant colors.
3.
Signage should not utilize more than one color for the primary message copy, unless a second color is used to create a shadowing or outlining effect.
4.
For panel signs, the background color shall mean the panel itself.
5.
For channel letters, the background color shall mean the returns.
6.
If a portion of the building behind a wall sign is painted a different color than the remainder of the wall, then such portion of the wall shall be counted as background color.
7.
Trim colors shall be counted as background colors.
(10)
Master signage.
a.
For new construction or the exterior remodel of more than 50 percent of a building, a master sign plan is strongly suggested for all multi-building or multi-occupant commercial developments before any permanent signs for such development may be erected. All owners, tenants, subtenants and purchasers of individual units within the development shall comply with the approved master sign plan, or submit to the design review board for approval.
b.
The master sign plan shall consist of five elements that shall govern all signs within the development: location, materials, size, color and illumination.
c.
The master sign plan shall include details, specifications, dimensions, and plans showing the proposed locations of signs and how such locations conform to the requirements of this article.
d.
A master sign plan should show the allocation of permitted wall sign space among proposed tenants and any general building sign or signs.
e.
A master sign plan may be amended by filing a new master plan through the design review board (DRB) application process.
f.
The master sign plan application may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by the proposed change, or an agent, lessee or contract purchaser specifically authorized by the owner. If a governing board for the property affected exists, then the governing board may provide written authorization for all land owners affected.
g.
A tenant sign package is encouraged for multi-tenant buildings.
h.
In general, signage should be limited to not more than three approved colors.
(11)
Murals. Murals shall be appropriately scaled and visually compatible with the buildings on which they are placed. Not all buildings are appropriate for mural display, and careful consideration shall be given to any mural proposed within the downtown historic district.
(12)
Awnings. Awning signs shall be allowed, provided that:
a.
The maximum area of an awning sign shall not exceed ten percent of the total awning face front and side area.
b.
Awning signs may be illuminated only with direct surface lighting and not with any form of back lighting.
(13)
Display of logos and trademarks, generally. Logos and trademarks may be included on signs without separate restriction, provided that such logos and trademarks are consistent with the approved color scheme shown on the master sign plan. Logos for single occupancy projects also shall be limited to the three-color requirement.
(14)
Display of registered trademarks.
a.
A federally registered trademark or service mark that is registered as a stylized/design mark in colors inconsistent with the applicable master sign plan or the color limitations applicable to a single-occupancy property may nevertheless be displayed on a sign in its registered form and color, provided that it may only occupy up to 20 percent of the permitted area of any sign, without regard to the color limitations otherwise applicable to the sign.
b.
Placement on the sign shall be in accordance with any applicable provisions of the master sign plan. This division does not specify where a logo must be placed on a sign.
c.
Holders of multi-colored federally registered trademarks or of federally registered trademarks that do not conform to the colors shown in the applicable master sign plan or with the three-color limitation on single-occupancy properties may, at the holder's choice, elect to display the mark in a color pattern consistent with the applicable master sign plan; or, the holder may display the mark in its registered colors, provided that it shall not occupy more than ten percent of the permitted area of the sign on which it appears.
d.
The holder of a federally registered trademark that conforms to the colors shown in the applicable master sign plan may display that logo as part of the permitted signage without further restriction.
e.
Solar panels should be designed to be visually compatible with the architectural design of the primary structure.
(15)
Landscaping.
a.
Where existing topographic patterns contribute to the beauty and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and developed. Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance and complement architectural features, strengthen vistas and lines of sight and provide shade. Vehicular areas shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree guards, or other devices wherever possible. Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees and shrubs in the parkways or paved areas is encouraged. Screening of service yards, exterior utilities (includes generators, water chillers, etc.), refuse collection areas and other places which tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by the use of walls, fencing, landscaping or any approved combination of these. Screening shall be effective in winter and summer seasons. Every effort shall be made to respect and preserve existing landforms, trees and other landscape elements. Shielding of vehicular parking areas, service areas and driveways from adjacent properties and public rights-of-ways shall be accomplished through the use of effective screening mechanisms such as landscaped earthen berms, lowering the parking level grade below sight lines from public rights-of-way, and by the use of evergreen screen landscaping.
b.
Plant materials are encouraged to be indigenous or naturalizing but not of exotic origin to this region and climate. Care should be taken in selection of plant materials that do not require excessive irrigation or maintenance. Scale and proportion of the building should be considered. Landscaping should be utilized to complement and soften the architecture of buildings, structures and monument signs and soften or screen views of parking areas from public rights-of-way. Equal attention shall be given to landscaping along the side and back of buildings as well as the front.
c.
The following minimum requirements must be met:
1.
Provide decorative landscaping near building entrances or patios (planting beds, large pots, etc.).
2.
Screen dumpster and recycling bins with a masonry wall to match the building and opaque metal gates and evergreen plantings. See Standard Plan 700.
3.
Monument signs should not displace required landscaping. Base plantings around signs shall include evergreens and seasonal plantings.
4.
Parking areas should be demarcated from pedestrian connections with pavers, stamped concrete or other material that differentiates the pedestrian walkways.
5.
Provide paved pedestrian connections from public sidewalks to the site interior (may not be located within a required tree island).
6.
Sites should include a minimum of one bicycle rack, one bench and one trash receptacle.
7.
All landscaped areas should be maintained by the use of automatic irrigation systems or as approved by the community development department. Automatic irrigation systems shall comply with the water conservation ordinance.
(16)
Streetscape guidelines.
a.
Old Milton Parkway.
1.
Brookside area tree placement. Shade trees such as willow oaks, nuttall oaks, American elms, etc., are to be spaced 50 feet on center alternated with groupings of understory trees and accent shrubs. Flowering or variegated leaf color is encouraged.
2.
Granville lights are to be located 80 feet on center. The color is to be black.
3.
Benches are to be placed at the rate of one unit every 100 linear feet.
4.
Medians. Groupings of understory flowering trees and accent shrubs with ends of beds are to be planted with dwarf lemon yellow daylilies or similar. Alternate with blocks of evergreen trees such as holly (Savannah, Foster, or Nellie Stevens), staggered at eight feet on center, and ends of the bed are to be planted with Knockout roses or similar. Planting shall allow for a minimum visual clearance of 24 feet at the end of each median which shall be planted with dwarf daylilies or other groundcover. Median widths of less than two feet shall be brick pavers (no plants).
b.
North Main Street.
1.
Shade trees such as hybrid red maples, Asian elms, or American or European hornbeams, etc., shall be spaced 50 feet on center. Alternate with groupings of understory trees and accent shrubs. Flowering or variegated leaf color is encouraged.
2.
Granville lights are to be located 50 feet on center. The color is to be black. Benches are to be placed at the rate of one unit every 150 linear feet.
3.
Medians. Groupings of understory trees shall be under planted with Knockout roses or similar. Flowering or variegated leaf color is encouraged. Alternate with blocks of evergreen trees such as Nellie Stevens holly staggered at eight feet on center. Ends of the bed are to be planted with low ornamental shrubs. Plantings shall allow for a minimum visual clearance of 24 feet at the end of each median which shall be planted with dwarf daylilies or other groundcover. Median widths of less than two feet shall consist of brick pavers (no plants).
4.
The central business district shall comply with the downtown incentive zoning guidelines.
(17)
Building, structure and sign material colors.
a.
Building color palettes. The use of muted, subdued or earth tone colors are encouraged while the use of novelty and primary colors are strongly discouraged and are to be avoided. It is the intent of these guidelines to establish timelessness in the color schemes incorporated in the building design and project design. Colors are intended to enhance the architecture of the project, not to attract attention to specific features or elements such as roof or parapet lines and signs. Building colors for the central business and historic business districts are to be derived from the "historic" or "Williamsburg" collections or palette by Benjamin Moore, or equivalent. Equivalent colors matching the above named manufacturers are acceptable.
b.
Deviation from the approved colors may be considered by the board where appropriate or as part of accented design elements. In general, a project should use no more than three of the approved colors.
(18)
Undesirable elements. The following elements are strongly discouraged in all districts and corridors of influence:
a.
Visually obtrusive stormwater detention or retention areas. Care should be taken to locate stormwater detention or retention areas in the least conspicuous areas of the project site or design them as a water feature. Additional care should be taken to mitigate the visual intrusion of detention or retention areas through the use of heavy landscaping, or concealing these areas underground. Utilization of the retention or detention pond as an attractive site feature is the preferred alternative.
b.
Visible roof-mounted equipment on buildings. Roof-mounted heating and air cooling units, exhaust hoods and fans, vent piping, satellite dishes, antennae and other roof appurtenances on the roof of a building are prohibited from being viewed from the ground by the general public and must be permanently screened. Any exterior ventilated HVAC units shall be internally drained (e.g., condensate lines).
c.
Visible dumpsters and recycling bins or containers. Dumpsters, refuse containers and recycling bins are required to be screened from public view with building materials that match the parent building, and their location on the project site is to be as inconspicuous as possible. Enclosure doors are to be constructed of steel or other durable materials that can be easily maintained and their color coordinated with the parent building.
d.
Excessive site and building lighting. Site and building lighting should be minimal, with lighting standards and levels being at the discretion of the board. Site lighting should not distract motorists or pedestrians traversing on or near the project site. Building lighting should not distract from the overall architecture of the building but should complement the building. Site or building lighting should not spill over onto adjacent properties, and should be directed specifically at the building in order to limit lighting of the night sky. However, site and building lighting is encouraged to provide a sense of security.
e.
Improper landscape design and lack of creativity. Attractive, complimentary landscapes are encouraged throughout the site using a mix of evergreen foundation plants, colorful accent plants and groundcovers. Untested, non-naturalizing or non-indigenous species of plants are strongly discouraged. Trees should be of larger caliper and size to create a pleasant and immediate impact upon installation. Shrubs should be of the largest container size possible.
f.
Removal of existing trees important to the character of the site. Large and significant trees should be protected where possible through the use of creative design solutions and manmade protection devices, such as tree wells, aeration systems, etc.
g.
Discouraged architectural elements. Mansard roofs; drive-through windows that become a primary visual focus; plastic elements; inappropriately ornate architectural elements (such as elements depicting animals); metal buildings; and mobile units are discouraged.
h.
Use of neon, fiber optic, and non-traditional illumination techniques is strongly discouraged. Use of neon tubing or other non-traditional illumination techniques which are visible are prohibited, unless covered by translucent material.
i.
Excessive use of building materials. In general, building materials should be limited to three types. Buildings incorporating too many different material types look busy and disjointed. Visual continuity should be considered by balancing building materials within the architectural elevations.
j.
Thematic architecture. Building styles that are overly theatrical in character or are designed to represent specific objects are strongly discouraged. Materials used to create theatrical design such as driftwood, netting, corrugated metal and mirrors are strongly discouraged.
k.
Excessive use of retaining walls. Use of retaining walls is discouraged. However, where required due to site conditions and grading considerations, care should be taken to mitigate their visual obtrusiveness. Finished materials must match the parent building or structure. Modular block walls are only allowed in non-visible areas of the site.
l.
Visually obtrusive parking structures or other accessory buildings. Parking structures must provide architectural details and materials to mitigate their visual obtrusiveness on all exterior elevations. Materials and colors must match those of the parent building. Should no parent building be adjacent, then the parking structure should be visually compatible with other adjacent structures. All surface water and stormwater shall be internally drained. Evergreen landscape trees and shrubs shall be incorporated to aid in screening the structure.
m.
Use of plastic materials and primary color accessory structures. Accessory structures such as playgrounds must not be visible from public rights-of-way. Plastic materials and primary colors are to be avoided.
n.
Murals. Murals shall be appropriately scaled and visually compatible with the buildings on which they are placed. Not all buildings are appropriate for mural display, and careful consideration shall be given to any mural proposed within the downtown historic district. Murals shall not include advertising or be commercial in nature.
o.
The board shall seek to minimize and discourage the use of the following architectural features within the city: mansard roofs, wooden shakes or shingles, drive-through windows that become a primary visual focus, overly plastic elements, metal buildings and mobile units.
(b)
General design standards. The board shall also consider the following general design standards when reviewing applications for certificates of design approval:
(1)
For new buildings and additions to existing buildings.
a.
The height of the rooflines or parapets along the street or public right-of-way.
b.
Scale and mass of the building on the site.
c.
Placement of the building on the site.
d.
Materials, colors and textures of the buildings.
e.
Architectural style where there is a predominant style on surrounding and adjacent buildings.
f.
Architectural details, including signs, subject to public view from any public street or public way.
g.
Incorporation of pedestrian-friendly features and amenities wherever possible. Pedestrian paths (e.g., sidewalks, mulched paths) should encourage pedestrian travel throughout an entire project. Pedestrian paths connecting adjacent properties and projects are also strongly encouraged.
(2)
For modifications to existing buildings.
a.
The degree to which the distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site, including historic materials, are retained.
b.
The historic appropriateness of any new features.
c.
The compatibility of proposed alterations with other buildings within the street block face or block face across the street, giving consideration to building size, shape, roofline, colors, materials, textures, nature of openings and architectural details.
(3)
For bridges and bridge encroachments.
a.
Bridges and bridge encroachments in all areas of the city are to be treated with enhanced architectural details. This would include all vehicular and pedestrian bridges and combinations thereof. Enhancements should include the use of brick and/or stone for the exterior and interior (roadway side) of the facades of bridges and all wing walls, abutments, beams, and piers. Horizontal and vertical relief should be provided along the sides to completely cover the substructure with a center point feature. All vehicular bridges shall include a separated (by a decorative barrier) sidewalk of ten feet. Barriers are encouraged to include plantings. All fencing proposed shall be of a decorative nature and should include a planting to create a "green" or "live" wall. The bridge should include decorative lighting of both vehicular and pedestrian heights. Each bridge center piece shall have an official city seal incorporated.
b.
Specific design standards. The board will consider the following specific design standards when reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness:
1.
It is the intent of the city to maintain and enhance the "traditional main street" character within the central business district and the historic districts. Outside these areas, the board will evaluate each project proposal based on the quality of its design and relationship to the architectural character and style of the surrounding buildings, structures and streetscape.
2.
Building scale, proportion and massing will be considered as follows: within the central business district and the historic districts, no single building design element shall exceed 100 feet in length; and no continuous, uninterrupted storefront elevation (elevation in the same plane) shall exceed 50 feet in length.
3.
The board shall seek to minimize and discourage the use of the following architectural features within the city:
(i)
Mansard roofs.
(ii)
Wooden shakes or shingles.
(iii)
Drive-through windows that become a primary visual focus.
(iv)
Plastic elements.
(v)
Inappropriate ornate architectural elements (such as elements depicting animals).
(vi)
Metal buildings.
(vii)
Mobile buildings.
(c)
Additional standards. Subject to the approval of the city council, the board shall have the authority from time to time to promulgate additional design standards. Such additional design standards shall be effective upon approval by the city council.
