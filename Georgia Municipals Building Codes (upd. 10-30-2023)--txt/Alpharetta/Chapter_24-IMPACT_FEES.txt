Any person who, after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, engages in development, shall pay a development impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article.
(1)
Construction not subject to impact fees.
a.
The following projects and construction activities do not constitute development as defined in this article, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees:
1.
Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development (as defined in this article) that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property.
2.
Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development.
3.

6.
Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, detached garage or utility shed, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facility such as a swimming pool or tennis court.
b.
A person claiming to be not subject to impact fees under subsection (1)a.1 of this section shall submit to the administrator information and documentation sufficient to permit the administrator to determine whether such claim is correct.
(2)
Grandfathered projects.
a.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be subject to development impact fees, so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit.
b.
Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this article, provided that:
1.
All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be or have been paid in full; and
2.
Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within 180 days, whichever is later.
(3)
Method of calculation.
a.
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element.
b.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be the net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element, and which:
1.
Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and
2.
Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category for which an impact fee is imposed.
c.
The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the city, and may be amended from time to time by official act.
d.
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements, to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element.
e.
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element.
Sec. 24-23. - Fee schedule; payment; individual assessment; certification.
(a)
Fee schedule.
(1)
Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived and incorporated herein as Attachment A, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article.
(2)
When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure other than a shopping center, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. Shopping centers shall be assessed a single impact fee, in accordance with Attachment A, as a single use without regard to its individual tenants.
(3)
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator, in his reasonable discretion, shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.
c.
If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this article, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the city's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the city council.
d.
Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article.
(b)
Timing of assessment and payment.
(1)
Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit.
(2)
All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than at the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy for the building or building shell.
(3)
For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property.
(4)
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the following:
a.
Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy, as applicable, the developer shall recertify in writing to the administrator the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage of floor area attributable to each use.
b.
In the event that the actual land use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual land use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the impact fee applicable to the actual land use or uses and/or gross square footage exceeds the impact fee previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy.
c.
The amount of the excess shall be based upon the impact fee schedule in effect on the date the interior finishes permit or the certificate of occupancy is issued.
d.
If the actual gross square footage constructed after the issuance of the building permit is less than the amount originally certified, the developer shall be entitled to a refund of the excess portion of the fee.
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)
Individual assessment determinations. An individual assessment of development impact fees for a particular property or proposed use may be established as follows:
(1)
At his option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for his project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A.
(2)
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. The individual assessment study shall:
a.
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or
b.
Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Alpharetta or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and
c.
Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination.
(3)
The administrator, in his reasonable discretion, shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article.
(4)
Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article.
(d)
Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a property owner or developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived and incorporated herein as Attachment A, or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable.

(2)
The administrator shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within 30 days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the administrator shall establish the total impact fee for the proposed development activity for the 180-day period immediately following the date of such certification.
(3)
Notwithstanding the issuance of any certification of an individual fee determination, any additions to the proposed development activity different from the development activity identified in the original application shall be subject to increased or additional impact fees in accordance with the new total amount of development. The impact fees shall be based upon the impact fee schedule in effect at the time of building permit issuance for the development.
Sec. 24-24. - Exemptions.
(a)
Exemption policy. The city recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the mayor and city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth or public benefit to the city, in accordance with exemption criteria the city may adopt. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.
(b)
Process for exemption approval. An application for exemption shall be considered under the following procedures:
(1)
An application for exemption approval must be made to the administrator prior to or along with an application for a building permit. Any exemptions not so applied for shall be deemed waived.
(2)
A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and impact fees have been paid.
(3)
Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the city. This documentation constitutes the application for exemption.
(4)
The administrator, in his reasonable discretion, shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the city and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article.
(5)
The administrator or the city council shall determine the eligibility for and extent of exemption, in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in the exemption criteria adopted by the city council. If action by the city council is required, the application for exemption shall be considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council that falls at least two weeks after a complete application for exemption has been received by the administrator.

All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within 60 days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than 30 days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund.
(2)
A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected.
(3)
In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the city for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element.
Sec. 24-28. - Private agreements procedure.
(a)
Private agreements; authorized. Nothing in this article shall prohibit the voluntary mutual approval of a private contractual agreement between the city and any developer or property owner or group of developers and/or property owners in regard to the construction or installation of system improvements and providing for credits or reimbursement for system improvement costs incurred by a developer, including inter-project transfers of credits or providing for reimbursement for project improvement costs which are used or shared by more than one development project.
(b)
Private agreements; procedure.
(1)
Any private agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the administrator for review and negotiation, prior to submission to the city council.
(2)
Any private agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney as to form and sufficiency prior to consideration by the city council.
(3)
Any such agreement must be presented to and approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(4)
Any such agreement shall provide for execution by mortgagees, lien holders or contract purchasers in addition to the land owner, and shall require the applicant to submit such agreement to the clerk of the superior court for recording.
Sec. 24-29. - Amendments; review; continuation.
(a)
Article amendments.
(1)
This article may be amended from time to time as deemed appropriate or desirable.
(2)
Interim amendments to the impact fee schedule regarding the establishment of new land use categories by the administrator under section 24-23(a)(3)c are expressly authorized, and shall be confirmed by the city council when the annual CIE update required under subsection (b)(1) of this section is approved, or when this article is subsequently amended.
(b)
Capital improvements element periodic review.
(1)
Annual update. At least once each year, the city council shall review and may update the capital improvements element so as to maintain, at a minimum, a schedule of system improvements for each of the subsequent five years. The capital improvements element update may include changes in funding sources or project costs, or changes in the list or scheduling of projects. The capital improvements element update shall be submitted to the Atlanta Regional Commission for its review, in accordance with the development impact fee compliance requirements as adopted by the state board of community affairs.
(2)
Amendment. In conducting a periodic review of the capital improvements element and calculation of development impact fees, the city council may determine to amend the capital improvements element. Amendments to the capital improvements element shall comply with the procedural requirements of the development impact fee compliance requirements as adopted by the state board of community affairs, and shall be required for any change to the capital improvements element that would:
a.
Redefine growth projections, land development assumptions, or goals or objectives that would affect system improvements proposed in the capital improvements element;
b.
Add new public facility categories for impact fee funding, modify impact fee service areas or make changes to system improvement projects;
c.
Change service levels established for an existing impact fee service area; or
d.
Make any other revisions needed to keep the capital improvements element up to date.
(c)
Continuation of validity. Failure of the city council to undertake a periodic review of the capital improvements element shall result in the continued use and application of the latest adopted development impact fee schedule and other data. The failure to periodically review such data shall not invalidate this article.
Sec. 24-30. - Appeals.
(a)
Eligibility to file an appeal. Only applicants or feepayors who have already been assessed an impact fee by the city or who have already received a written determination of individual assessment, refund or credit amount shall be entitled to an appeal. Such appeals may address:
(1)
The imposition of an impact fee.
(2)
The amount of an impact fee.
(3)
The entitlement to and/or the amount of credits applicable to an impact fee.
(4)
The entitlement to and/or the amount of a refund of an impact fee.
(b)
Appeals process.
(1)
The aggrieved applicant or feepayor (hereinafter, the "appellant") must file a written appeal with the administrator within 15 days of the decision or receipt of written determination from which the appeal is taken.
(2)
Such written appeal shall constitute an application for relief, shall be of sufficient content to set forth the basis for the appeal and the relief sought, and shall include:
a.
The name and address of the appellant;
b.
The location of the affected property; and
c.
A copy of any applicable written decision or determination made by the administrator from which the appeal is taken.

Within 15 days after receipt of the appeal, the administrator shall make a written final decision with respect to the appeal, such decision to be of sufficient content to set forth the basis for the determination.
(4)
Appeals from the final decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council within 30 days of receipt by the appellant of the administrator's final decision. Delivery by hand or certified mail to, or posting upon the property at, the address given by the appellant in the application for relief shall constitute receipt by the appellant under this provision.
(5)
The city council shall thereafter hold a hearing on the appeal within 30 days, provided that at least two weeks' written notice thereof can be given to the appellant. The city council shall decide the issue within a reasonable time following the hearing, but in no case later than its next regular meeting, unless the appellant agrees to an extension to a later date. Any party making an appeal shall have the right to appear at the hearing to present evidence and may be represented by counsel.
(c)
Payment of impact fee during appeal.
(1)
The filing of an appeal shall not stay the collection of a development impact fee as a condition to the issuance of development approval.
(2)
A developer may pay a development impact fee under protest to obtain a development approval, and by making such payment, shall not be estopped from exercising this right of appeal or receiving a refund of any amount deemed to have been collected in excess.
Sec. 24-31. - Enforcement; violations.
(a)
Enforcement authority.
(1)
The enforcement of this article shall be the responsibility of the administrator and such personnel as the administrator may designate from time to time.
(2)
The administrator shall have the right to inspect the lands affected by this article and shall have the right to issue a written notice, a stop-work order or citation for violations, as the administrator, in his reasonable determination, may deem appropriate to the circumstances. Refusal of written notice of violation, stop-work order or citation under this article shall constitute legal notice of service. The citation shall be in the form of a written official notice issued in person or by certified mail to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person performing the work. The receipt of a citation shall require that corrective action be taken within 30 days, unless otherwise extended at the discretion of the administrator.
(3)

(b)
Violations.
(1)
Knowingly furnishing false information on any matter relating to the administration of this article shall constitute an actionable violation.
(2)
Proceeding with construction of a project that is not consistent with the project's impact fee assessment, such as the use category claimed or units of development indicated, shall constitute an actionable violation.
(3)
Failure to take corrective action following the receipt of a citation shall constitute an actionable violation.
(4)
A violation of this article shall be a misdemeanor punishable according to law, including the general penalty provisions of this Code. In addition to or in lieu of criminal prosecution, the city council shall have the power to sue in law or equity for relief in civil court to enforce this article, including recourse to such civil and criminal remedies in law and equity as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief to enjoin and restrain any person from violating the provisions of this article and to recover such damages as may be incurred by the implementation of specific corrective actions.
