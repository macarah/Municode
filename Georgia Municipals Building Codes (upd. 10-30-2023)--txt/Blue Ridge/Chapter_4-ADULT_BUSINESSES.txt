It shall be a defense to liability that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

Sec. 4-18. - Location of sexually oriented businesses.

Within 750 feet of a residence or residential zoning district;
(2)
Within 1,500 feet of a church, school, governmentally owned or operated building, library, civic center, public park, hospital, community club, or prison;

For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a straight line from the closest part of any structure occupied by the sexually oriented business to the closest property line of the zoned property and uses identified in subsection (a) of this section. Where a use identified in subsection (a) of this section is located in a multi-tenant development, the distance shall be measured to the closest part of the tenant space occupied by that use rather than the property line of the entire development, so as to maximize the number of locations available to sexually oriented businesses.
(c)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Code to the contrary, a sexually oriented business in a location that satisfies the standards in this section shall not be deemed noncompliant with this section by virtue of the subsequent establishment or expansion of a land use or zoning district identified in subsection (a) of this section.
(d)
Amortization.
(1)
As used in this section, the term "lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business" means a business that qualifies as a sexually oriented business, as defined in section 4-1, that:
a.
Was, in all respects, lawfully established, continuously licensed, and continuously operated until the ordinance from which this chapter is derived was adopted;
b.
Has continuously, lawfully operated since the ordinance from which this chapter is derived was adopted; and
c.
Does not conform to the location standards for sexually oriented businesses set forth in this chapter.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business may continue to operate in its nonconforming location until December 31, 2022, in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in said location that was made before the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. On or before January 1, 2023, the sexually oriented business shall conform to the location standards for sexually oriented businesses in this Code.
(3)
Hardship extension. A lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business may apply to extend the time to operate its sexually oriented business in its nonconforming location upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an initial extension based upon financial hardship shall be made by October 31, 2022. If a hardship extension is granted, subsequent applications for hardship extensions shall be made at least 60 days before the conclusion of the business's then-current extension period.
(4)
Procedure. An application for a hardship extension shall be filed in writing with the director, shall include documentation showing that the establishment is a lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business, shall specify the length of extension requested, and shall include evidence of purchase and improvement costs, income earned and lost, depreciation, and costs of relocation. The application shall include an electronic copy of the business's accounting or bookkeeping records, including the computer files maintained in QuickBooks or any similar accounting or bookkeeping software. Within 20 days after receiving the application, the director shall schedule a public hearing on the application before the hearing officer, which public hearing shall be conducted within 45 days after the director's receipt of the application. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published at least ten days before the hearing on the city's website or in a newspaper of general circulation published within the city and shall identify the particular business and location for which the hardship extension is requested.
(5)
The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within ten days after the public hearing on the application for a hardship extension. The hardship extension shall be limited to a period of up to one year, as proven necessary by the applicant. The hardship extension shall be granted only upon a showing that the applicant is a lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business and is unable to recoup its investments, made prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, in its current location unless the hardship extension is granted.
