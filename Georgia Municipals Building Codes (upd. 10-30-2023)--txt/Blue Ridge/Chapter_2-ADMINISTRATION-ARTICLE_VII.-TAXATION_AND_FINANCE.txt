Sec. 2-654. - Levy of executions; sale of property.
modified
(a)
The levy officer is delegated the duties set forth in this division. The levy officer shall be subject to being ruled for money in his/her hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the city. After first paying the city administrator or his/her designee the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the levy officer shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi.fa.
(b)
In all cases of levying on real property, within five days written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi.fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the levy officer shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi.fa. therein.
(c)
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the levy officer's duty, before proceeding to advertise the property for sale, to give 20 days written notice of the levy to the record owner of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the years for which the taxes were assessed and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The levy officer shall keep a copy of the notice on which he/she shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where and to whom the notice was delivered. The levy officer shall file the copy with the city clerk.
(d)
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the levy officer in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi.fa. shall be given at least ten days written notice of the sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim of lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the levy officer shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e)
The levy officer shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the years for which taxes have been executed.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the levy officer before the city hall on the first Tuesday of each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions, and neither the levy officer conducting the sale, nor the city, shall make any representations or warranty of title, condition or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
(g)
The levy officer shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sale price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the levy officer to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the levy officer either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this division shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under the power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The levy officer shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
(h)
Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the levy officer may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The levy officer shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.

modified
(a)
If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the levy officer's cost due on the sale, then the city administrator or his/her designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the levy officer shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator or his/her designee. The levy officer shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 2-658.
(c)
The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 2-658.

Sec. 2-656. - Accounting by levy officer; final return or settlement.
modified
(a)

He/she shall pay over to the city administrator or his/her designee all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties and costs and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess.
(b)
In any event, if, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his/her hands, the levy officer finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he/she shall so notify the city administrator or his/her designee. It shall be the duty of the levy officer to cause cancellation of executions of the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection.
(Code 2003, § 35.26; Ord. of 11-14-2000; Ord. No. BR2022-22 , 7-19-2022)
Sec. 2-657. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgments.
modified
(a)
Whenever the levy officer can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi.fa. on which to levy and tax execution in his/her hands, he/she shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city attorney, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi.fa. or who has property, money or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi.fa. The city attorney shall enter upon the execution the names of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
(b)
When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of nulla bona has been duly entered by the levy officer on the execution within the immediately proceeding 30-day period and the city attorney has reason to believe the defendant in fi.fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the city attorney, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi.fa. maintains a known residence, place of business or agent to receive service to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi.fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-3-1 et seq.

Sec. 2-658. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi.fa.; vesting of title in grantee.
modified
(a)
Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-45, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this division.
(b)
Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi.fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi.fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescription term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.

modified

(c)
In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the levy officer shall collect his/her fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00 and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00.

All usual and standard fees, expenses, and charges, such as the disconnection charge and the reconnection fee, must also be paid by said customer, in order to again receive service from the city, as well as the customer complying with the ordinances, rules and regulations of the city by being in compliance with the ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city, including, but not limited to, paying any amounts owed to the city.
