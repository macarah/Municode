(Ord. of 3-8-2005(1), art. 5)
Sec. 20-169. - General design guidelines.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this subdivision to provide general guidelines for the preparation of a grading plan that indicates clear feasibility for roads and building envelope without massive manipulation of the site. This subdivision records preferences and principles for grading plans and the grading process.
(b)
General.
(1)
The grading or alteration of key topographic features, such as knolls, ridgelines, bedrock outcrops, cliffs, and ravines, should be avoided whenever possible.
(2)
A manufactured appearance for graded slopes should be avoided. Sharp cuts and long or wide slopes at a uniform grade are unacceptable. Where two cut or fill slopes intersect, the intersection should be horizontally rounded and blended. Where any cut or fill slopes intersect the natural grade, the intersection of each slope should be vertically and/or horizontally rounded and blended with the natural contours so as to present a natural appearance. See Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1
Figure 6-2
Figure 6-3
(3)
Contours and gradients that resemble the naturally occurring terrain should be encouraged. Slope transitions should be rounded out and transitions between lots or adjacent undisturbed areas should be blended. The overall shape, height or grade of any cut or fill slopes should be developed utilizing contour grading in concert with existing natural contours and the scale of the natural terrain of the site. The tops of cut and fill slopes should be rounded vertically with a constant tangent of ten feet. Where any cut or fill slope exceeds 100 feet in horizontal length, the horizontal contours of the slope should be developed in concert with existing natural contours. See Figure 6-2.
(4)
The grading of large flat terraces on hillside sites in order to expand developable area or to develop housing or other uses characteristics of flat or gently-sloped sites should be discouraged. The development of smaller terraces for such development as building pads, lawn areas, patios, and stepped retaining walls should be acceptable. See Figure 6-3.
(c)
Cut and fill. The amount of cut and fill and its environmental impact should be minimized.
(1)
Where the volume of cut exceeds the volume of fill on a site proposed for grading, excess volume should not be disposed of on-site in the form of unnecessary filling, berming, or side-casting. When necessary, excess material should be disposed of at appropriate locations off-site.
(2)
The exposed slope should be revegetated as quickly as possible to prevent erosion and slope stability problems.
(d)
Retaining walls.
(1)
Retaining walls should be employed where they can reduce disturbing the slope to provide useable construction sites.
(2)
Retaining walls should be used to respect the natural character of the site and not be dominating or fortress-like.
(3)
Retaining or crib walls in an area not open to public view should generally be permitted up to six feet in height. Retaining or crib walls exposed to public view should generally not exceed three feet in height.
(4)
It is encouraged that a system of smaller stepped retaining walls be employed over the use of a large uniform wall. The height and depth of the wall steps should be consistent with the natural terrain or with the slope above and below the walls. For a stepped retaining wall system, intermediate terraces should be landscaped. See Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4
(5)
If the retaining wall is related to the structural integrity of the building, it will be necessary to address the retaining wall through the building permit process.
(Ord. of 3-8-2005(1), art. 6)
Sec. 20-170. - Standards and requirements.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this subdivision is to codify design guidelines, some of which were enumerated in section 20-169, into a set of quantifiable minimum standards that apply to all grading.
(b)
Clearing. Although clearing appears as a defined land disturbing activity as land disturbing is defined in section 20-165, this subdivision neither provides for nor regulates clearing.
(c)
Cuts.
(1)
General. Unless otherwise recommended in an approved soils engineering and/or engineering geology report, when called for, cuts shall conform to the provisions of this section. In the absence of an approved soils engineering report, these provisions may be waived for minor cuts not intended to support structures.
(2)
Slope. The slope of cut surfaces shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), unless the owner furnishes a soils engineering or an engineering geology report, or both, stating that the site has been investigated and giving an opinion that a cut at a steeper slope will be stable and not create a hazard to the public or private property and is consistent with the overall landform grading. The planning officer shall have the ultimate decision as to whether a slope steeper than 2:1 may be permitted.
(3)
Drainage and terracing. Drainage and terracing shall be provided as required in subsection (d)(6) of this section.
(d)
Fills.
(1)
General. Unless otherwise recommended in an approved soils engineering and/or engineering geology report, fills shall conform to the provisions of this section. In the absence of an approved soils engineering report, the planning officer may waive these provisions for minor fills not intended to support structures.
(2)
Preparation of ground. The ground shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil, and other suitable materials, scarifying to provide a bond with the new fill and, where slopes are steeper than five to one (5:1) and the height is greater than five feet, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material, as determined by a soils engineer.
(3)
Fill material.
a.
Detrimental amounts of organic materials shall not be permitted in fills. Except as permitted by the planning officer, no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than 12 inches shall be buried or placed in fills.
b.
Exception. The planning officer may permit placement of larger rock when the soils engineer properly devises a method of placement and approves the fill stability. The following conditions shall also apply:
1.
Prior to issuance of the grading permit, potential rock disposal areas shall be delineated on the grading plan.
2.
Rock sizes greater than 12 inches in maximum dimension shall be ten feet or more below grade measured vertically.
3.
Rocks shall be placed so as to ensure filling all voids.
(4)
Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of maximum density as determined by UBC Standard No. 70-1. In-place density shall be determined in accordance with recognized current ASTM standards for determining in-place density of soils. After 90 percent compaction has been obtained, those areas of the graded site that will not be built upon may be scarified to promote the growth of landscaping, improve irrigation and reduce drainage problems.
(5)
Slope. The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use and shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), unless the owner furnishes a soils engineer or an engineering geology report, or both, stating that the site has been investigated and giving an opinion that a fill at a steeper slope will be stable and not create a hazard to adjoining property and is consistent with the overall landform grading. The planning officer shall have the ultimate decision as to whether a slope steeper than 2:1 may be permitted.
(6)
Drainage and terracing for retaining walls and setbacks. Drainage and terracing shall be provided and the area above fill slopes and the surfaces of terraces shall be graded and paved as required by subsection (3) of this section.
a.
Retaining walls. Retaining walls constructed of materials architecturally consistent with the development may be permitted in lieu of, or in combination with, cut or fill slopes. Retaining or crib walls in an area not open to public view are permitted up to six feet in height, unless a higher wall is approved by the planning officer. Retaining or crib walls exposed to public view shall not exceed three feet in height, unless approved by the planning officer, and shall be included as part of the permitted height of the slope.
b.
Setbacks. Cut and fill slopes shall be setback from site boundaries in accordance with this section. Setback dimensions shall be horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the site boundary.
1.
Top of cut slope. The top of cut slopes shall be made not nearer to the site boundary line than one-half of the vertical height of cut with a minimum of two feet and a maximum of ten feet. The setback may need to be increased for any required interceptor drains.
2.
Toe of fill slope. The toe of fill slope shall not be made not nearer to a site boundary line than one-fifth the vertical height of the slope with a minimum of two feet and a maximum of 20 feet. Where a fill slope is to be located near the site boundary and the adjacent off-site property is developed, special precautions shall be incorporated in the work, as the planning officer deems necessary, to protect the adjoining property from damage as a result of such grading. These precautions may include, but are not limited to:
(i)
Additional setbacks;
(ii)
Provision for retaining or slough walls;
(iii)
Mechanical or chemical treatment of the fill slope to minimize erosion;
(iv)
Provisions for the control of surface water;
(v)
Modification of slope location. The planning officer may approve alternate setbacks. Such modification must afford comparable slope protection and erosion control as compared to the setbacks herein required. The planning officer may require an investigation and recommendation by a qualified engineer or engineering geologist to demonstrate that the intent of this section has been satisfied.
(e)
Drainage and terracing for cut or fill slopes, swales or ditches.
(1)
General. Drainage facilities shall conform to the provisions of this section for cut or fill slopes steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3:1).
(2)
Terraces.
a.
Terraces of at least six feet in width shall be established at not more than 30-foot vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to control surface drainage and debris, except that where only one terrace is required, it shall be at mid-height. For cut or fill slopes greater than 60 feet and up to 120 feet in vertical height, one terrace at approximately mid-height shall be 12 feet in width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than 120 feet in height shall be designed by a civil engineer and approved by the planning officer. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper cleaning and maintenance.
b.
Swales or ditches on terraces shall have a minimum gradient of five percent and must be paved with reinforced concrete not less than three inches in thickness or an approved equal paving. They shall have minimum depth at the deepest point of one foot and minimum paved width of five feet.

(3)
Subsurface drainage. Cut and fill slopes shall be provided with subsurface drainage as necessary for stability.
(4)
Disposal. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry water to the nearest practicable drainageway approved by the planning officer and/or other appropriate jurisdiction as a safe place to deposit such water. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of non-erosive downdrains or other devices.
(5)
Building pads. Building pads shall have a drainage gradient of two percent toward approved drainage facilities, unless waived by the planning officer.
(6)
Interceptor drains. Paved interceptor drains shall be installed along the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area above slopes toward the cut and has a drainage path greater than 40 feet measured horizontally. Interceptor drains shall be paved with a minimum of three inches of reinforced concrete or gunite. They shall have a minimum depth of 12 inches and a minimum width of 30 inches measured horizontally against the drain. The slope of drains shall be approved by the planning officer.
