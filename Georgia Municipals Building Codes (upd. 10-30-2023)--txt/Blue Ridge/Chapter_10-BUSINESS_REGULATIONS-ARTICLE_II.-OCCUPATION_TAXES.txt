In addition to other remedies available under other ordinances of the city or under state statute for collection of occupational taxes and associated administrative fees from delinquent taxpayers, the city administrator or his/her designee may issue executions against delinquent taxpayers for the amount of such unpaid occupational taxes and administrative fees due as of the day following the last day for payment, plus penalty and interest thereon as provided herein and as authorized by O.C.G.A. § 48-13-21.
(b)
The right of the city to prosecute criminally delinquent taxpayers violating this subchapter by failing to pay occupational taxes or by refusing to register voluntarily for such taxes shall be in addition to, and unaffected by, the remedy of issuing executions against delinquent taxpayers as authorized in subsection (a) of this section.
(c)
After the last day for payment of any occupational tax owed to the city, and receipt and posting of the license certificate issued by the city, any duly certified law enforcement officer of the police department of the city, including, but not limited to, the police chief, the assistant police chief, and any other officer of the police department, may issue a citation to the person, managing agent, or professional, operating any business, occupation, or profession within the incorporated boundaries of the city for not having paid the occupational taxes imposed by this Code or the posting of the license certificate, or both.
(d)
Any citation issued to any person, managing agent, or professional of any business, occupation or profession, for operating without paying occupational taxes or posting the license certificate, or both, shall specify a date and time for appearance before the municipal court of the city, in order for said court to determine whether said person, managing agent or professional has been operating without the payment of occupational taxes or the posting of the license certificate, or both, and if found to be in violation of the occupational tax provisions of this Code by the failure to pay occupational taxes or the posting of the license certificate, or both, then the municipal judge, in the judge's discretion, may impose a civil fine for failure to pay the occupational tax (including the administrative fees) or the posting of the license certificate, or both, not to exceed $500.00, and said civil fine may be enforced by the contempt power of the municipal court of the city. The city recognizes and acknowledges that only the Georgia Supreme Court has the power and authority to regulate the practice of law within the state, and no provision of this section shall be deemed to impose criminal penalties for the practice of law without an occupational tax license issued by the city or the failure to pay occupational taxes, or both. However, while legal professionals may be allowed to practice their occupations, failure to pay the occupational taxes imposed by this Code shall still subject them to interest, penalties, and any civil fine for failure to pay the taxes.

Sec. 10-74. - Returns confidential.
modified
Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, agent or clerk of the city or any other person to divulge or make known in any manner any information provided for the purpose of determining the amount of occupation tax required under this chapter. Such information shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents or clerks of the city using said returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as "agents of the city." Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by the city officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof, or information such as name, location, ownership and line of business with no association made to number of employees or amount of tax paid, or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the State of Georgia or of the United States, and other local governments. Information provided by a business or practitioner may be disclosed to the governing authority of another local government for tax purposes.

Sec. 10-75. - Inspection of books and records.
modified
In any case, the city administrator, through his or her officers, agents, employees or representatives, may inspect the books of the business for which the returns are made. The City administrator or his/her designees shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, and upon demand of the city administrator or his/her designees such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax certificate currently existing to do business in the city. In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, the city shall be sensitive to the issues of client or customer confidentiality. In such cases, the practitioner may redact information claimed to be privileged before disclosing books or records of financial transactions. If such practitioner alleges that redaction provides inadequate protection to the confidences of its clients or customers, such practitioner may petition the county superior court for an in-camera inspection, prior to examination by the city administrator or his/her designee. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city administrator or his/her designees at his/her discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty shall be imposed as set forth herein.

modified
Except for a person whose qualifications to practice law are determined by the general laws of the state, the failure of any business to pay said occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent or upon failure to permit inspection of its books as above provided, any business tax certificate granted by the city under this chapter permitting the owner of said business to do business in the city for the current year shall be, ipso facto, revoked. No new business tax certificate shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to a person who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city administrator or his/her designee in accordance with provisions set forth herein. In the case of practitioners of law, if any such person, firm, or corporation whose duty it is to obtain a registration and an occupation tax certificate shall fail to pay such tax in a timely fashion, such offender shall be subject to the penalties provided herein.

modified
Any persons, their manager, agent or employee, who does business in the city after the certificate for said business has been revoked as above; any person, their manager, agent or employee, who is hereby required to make returns showing the amount of full-time equivalent employees and who fail to make said returns within the time and in the manner herein provided, or refuse to amend such returns so as to set forth the correct information, or who shall make false returns, and except for practitioners of professions and occupations electing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a per employee tax, any person, their manager, agent or employee who refuses to permit an inspection of books in their charge when the officers, agents, employees or representatives of the city request such inspection, during business hours, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided for, shall be subject to penalties provided in this chapter.

modified
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city administrator or his/her designee, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the person liable for said tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property of the person liable for said tax, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of the city and state law. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city administrator or his/her designee upon the property of the person liable for said tax, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances and the Charter of the city and state law and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the Charter of the city and state law in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by property authority upon an execution issued by the city administrator or his/her designee against any person defaulting on the occupation tax the taxpayer against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the taxpayer against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full to other with all interest, penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the taxpayer may collect any fees and charges due the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the city of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

modified
(a)
As an additional remedy for the non-payment of any occupational taxes, penalties, interest, assessments, or other charges, assessed to a taxpayer or citizen pursuant to the occupational tax ordinance of the city, and as designated and referenced within this chapter, when the person or entity owing said funds to the city is a water customer or sewer customer, or both, the city administrator, the city attorney or other properly designated agent for the city may, in addition to all other remedies provided by the ordinances of the city of such nonpayment, request that service be withheld until such time as the water customer or sewer customer, or both, is no longer delinquent in the payment of occupational taxes, interest, penalties, assessments and other charges owed to the city. The city council specifically finds that should a person or entity owe delinquent occupational taxes, interest, and penalties on July 1 of any year to the city, and be a utility customer of the city, and therefore be in violation of the city's ordinances, rules and regulations, that any properly designated agent for the city may disconnect and terminate water service, or sewer service, or both, until such time as said customer is no longer in violation of the ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city, and has paid all delinquent occupational taxes, interest, and penalties. All usual and standard fees, expenses, and charges, such as the disconnection charge and the reconnection fee, must also be paid by said customer, in order to again receive service from the city, as well as the customer complying with the ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city by payment of the owed amounts.
(b)
Prior to disconnection, the city administrator or his/her designee shall mail a notice of the pending disconnection via regular mail to the address provided by the taxpayer no later than ten days before any disconnection. In the event no address was provided, the notice shall be mailed or hand delivered to the physical location of the business.

Sec. 10-87. - Occupation tax certificate not transferable.

(3)
The termination of any business.

modified
It being the intention of the mayor and council that no portion of this taxation scheme shall be construed to be, or have the practical effect of, unauthorized regulation of practitioners of professions and occupations and if any provision hereof shall be construed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an unlawful regulation of such profession, then such provision shall be considered rescinded by the mayor and council as if such provision had not been adopted, and in such case, the remaining provisions of this chapter shall be applied to such practitioner.
