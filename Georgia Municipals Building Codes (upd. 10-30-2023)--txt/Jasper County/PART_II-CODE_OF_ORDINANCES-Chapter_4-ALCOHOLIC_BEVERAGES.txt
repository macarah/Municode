Malt beverages, wine or distilled spirits shall only be delivered to or received at the premises of a retail licensee in the county by a vehicle owned and operated by a wholesale dealer licensed by the county. Upon each delivery of distilled spirits by such wholesaler, an invoice shall be prepared in triplicate showing the quantity, brands and prices of distilled spirits so delivered, together with the amount of the excise tax due and collected thereon. The original of each such invoice shall be delivered to the retailer at the time of delivery, and a copy shall be maintained by the retailer for a period of 12 months next following such delivery for examination by authorized representatives of the county. Upon request, copies of such invoices shall be submitted with any reports required by the county. Retail licensees shall maintain the original invoices for a period of 12 months next following such delivery and shall likewise maintain records of sales of distilled spirits and any other records required by the county. Authorized representatives of the county shall have the right to inspect licensees' records and to make complete audits of same at any time.
(Ord. of 6-24-1965; Ord. of 3-7-1974; Ord. of 6-4-1979; Ord. of 4-3-1989; Ord. of 5-4-1992; Ord. of 12-20-2010, § 6.4.010)
Sec. 4-91. - Retail storage.
Licensed retailers of packaged distilled spirits shall store same only on the premises for which the license was granted. All such stock shall be kept available at all times for inspection by authorized representatives of the county and shall be stored in or immediately adjacent to the room in which the licensee is authorized to conduct business. Any such inventory found to have been sold or distributed by a wholesaler not licensed to make sales or deliveries in the county shall be subject to immediate confiscation.
(Ord. of 6-24-1965; Ord. of 3-7-1974; Ord. of 6-4-1979; Ord. of 4-3-1989; Ord. of 5-4-1992; Ord. of 12-20-2010, § 6.4.020)
Sec. 4-92. - Exclusion of minors from licensed premises.
No licensee for retail sale of distilled spirits shall allow any minor to be or remain on the licensed premises unless such minor is accompanied by his parent or legal guardian.
(Ord. of 6-24-1965; Ord. of 3-7-1974; Ord. of 6-4-1979; Ord. of 4-3-1989; Ord. of 5-4-1992; Ord. of 12-20-2010, § 6.4.030)
Sec. 4-93. - Sale of unopened containers only.
Retail sales of malt beverages and wines except for on-premises consumption may only be in unopened containers and conducted within the building licensed for that purpose.
(Ord. of 6-24-1965; Ord. of 3-7-1974; Ord. of 6-4-1979; Ord. of 4-3-1989; Ord. of 5-4-1992; Ord. of 12-20-2010, § 6.4.040)
Sec. 4-94. - Reporting requirements for restaurants.
(a)
Each licensee for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption operating as a restaurant shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the county manager within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter:
(1)
A sworn statement on forms approved by the county of the licensee's retail sales during the preceding calendar quarter. Such statements shall reflect the licensee's total dollar sales amounts for the applicable calendar quarter, the total sales amounts for sales of malt beverages and wine, the total sales amounts for distilled spirits sold by the drink, and total dollar sales for food items.
(2)
Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use tax monthly reports as filed with state department of revenue for each month during the applicable calendar quarter.
(b)
Any sale of a food or beverage containing any alcoholic beverage shall be deemed to be a sale solely of malt beverages, wine or distilled spirits, as the case may be, and no such sale shall be included as food sales in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds sales of alcoholic beverages shall not be conclusive on the issue of whether the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant as herein defined; however, the failure of the food sales to exceed the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be prima facie evidence that the principal business of the licensee is not that of serving food as required to meet the definition of a restaurant.
(c)
Such quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as may be required by state law. Such forms shall be used solely by the county manager for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its retail license for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Failure to timely file such statements shall be a violation of a county ordinance punishable as provided in section 4-133 and shall further be a basis for the revocation of the license granted under this chapter. If, after appropriate notice and hearing, the judge of the county's magistrate court finds that a licensee's violation of this section is not willful and the licensee otherwise meets the requirements of a restaurant as provided in this chapter, the judge shall have the option of imposing a probationary period on the licensee, not to exceed six months, and any further violations of this article shall be a basis for revocation of such license.
