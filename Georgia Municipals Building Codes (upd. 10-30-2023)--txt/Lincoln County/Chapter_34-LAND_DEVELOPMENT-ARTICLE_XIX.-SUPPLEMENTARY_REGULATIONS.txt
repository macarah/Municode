Sec. 34-630. - Height of fences and walls in a residential zoning district.
No fence or wall, other than a retaining wall, in a required setback area for a residential zoning district shall be more than six feet in height above finished grade, except as required for screening as specified in section 34-633.
(Ord. No. 48, § 20-10, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-631. - Buffer requirements.
A buffer shall be required whenever two adjoining properties are in different zoning districts. Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a parcel along all lot lines adjoining different zoning districts including adjacent property lines, which may be separated by an existing or proposed public right-of-way. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street rights-of-way.
(1)
Required buffers in commercial and industrial zoning districts. In any commercial or industrial zoning district, where a commercial or industrial lot abuts any adjacent nonconforming residential use within that district, the required buffer for the commercial or industrial property when acquiring a building permit, unless the buffer was preexisting, shall consist of a 50-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards in section 34-633.
(2)
Required buffers between residential, commercial and industrial zoning districts. When two adjoining properties are in different residential, commercial or industrial zoning districts, the property within the zoning district allowing for more intensive uses is required to provide the buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting. When two adjoining vacant parcels are in different zoning districts, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use requires a building permit.
The required buffer shall consist of a 50-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards in section 34-633.
(3)
Required buffers between manufactured home parks, multifamily residential and single-family residential uses. When two adjoining properties are different in intensity of use (single-family residential is a less intensive use than either a multifamily residential or a manufactured home park), whether in the same or in different zoning districts, the property of the more intensive use is required to provide a buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting.
The required buffer shall consist of plantings or a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), or a berm, which meets the screening standards of section 34-633. If plantings are used as the method of screening, the planting area shall have a minimum base width of 12 feet.
(4)
Maintenance. The responsibility for maintenance of buffers shall remain with the owner of the property. Any required plant that has expired shall be replaced.
(5)
Failure to comply with the buffer requirements. See sections 34-421—34-430 for enforcement and penalty provisions.
(Ord. No. 48, § 20-11, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-632. - Screening of service areas.
Any service area, loading area, refuse or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from the street and lying within 100 feet of the street shall be provided with screening consisting of not less than a 25-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meet the screening standards of section 34-633.
(Ord. No. 48, § 20-12, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-633. - Screening standards.
Screening is a method of visually shielding one use from another by walls, fences, berms or densely planted vegetation. The director shall make a determination as to whether the required screening has occurred.
(1)
Plantings. Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or any combination of both. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines or in areas that provide the best screening effectiveness.
If trees or large shrubs are used solely as the screening device, under normal growing conditions, they should attain a minimum growing height of eight feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within four years. They shall be planted a minimum of 20 feet on center.
When trees or large shrubs, are used in conjunction with a wall, fence or a berm, or combination thereof, to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opaqueness shall be held to require no less than three feet of trees and/or shrubs in the area immediately adjacent to the wall, fence or a berm. This is to be measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of such plantings. They should attain a minimum growing height of eight feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within four years.
(2)
Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense use of land.
(3)
Fences. Fences shall be a minimum of six feet in height, but no more than eight feet in height. They shall be constructed of standard wood fencing material and methods of chain link with woven inserts that will provide 90 percent visual blockage. The fence shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use.
(4)
Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of six feet.
(Ord. No. 48, § 20-13, 1-9-2003)

(1)
Prohibited uses within an entrance or lake corridor.
a.
Class A, B, or C manufactured housing.
b.
Manufactured home parks.
c.
Accessory buildings with no primary building constructed on the lot.
(2)
Additional standards for accessory buildings. Accessory buildings with an entrance/lake corridor shall be architecturally similar to the main structure. Prefabricated carports, sheds or similar structures shall be permitted in all entrance or lake corridors where the underlying zoning district is agricultural (A-1, A-2, A-3) and shall conform to all other provisions of this code.
