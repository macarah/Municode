ARTICLE V. - PRELIMINARY PLAT

Sec. 34-131. - Application procedure.
(a)
A complete application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the director of planning and zoning together with the appropriate fee as determined by the board of commissioners. The director shall not accept a fee until an application has been completed according to the requirements of this section.
(b)
No less than five copies of the plat of the subdivision shall be submitted and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained in this chapter. Also, one copy shall be returned to the owner or proprietor of the subdivision or his representative with the date of the approval or disapproval noted thereon. The sheet size shall not exceed 18 by 24 inches nor be less than 8 ½ by 11 inches. If the complete plat cannot be shown on one sheet, it may be shown on more than one sheet with an index map on a separate sheet of the same size. Each copy shall have original signatures in a contrasting color.
(c)
Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name, phone number and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee); and no preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission without full compliance with the requirements of the preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor, registered professional engineer or licensed landscape architect.
(d)
Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the planning commission. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed to any other person or agency as deemed necessary by the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit the plat to the planning commission prior to formal approval of the preliminary plat.
(Ord. No. 48, § 6-1, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-132. - Public hearing.
After acceptance of a complete application for preliminary plat approval, including all accompanying material, by the director, the planning commission shall call a public hearing for the next scheduled meeting of the commission to be held at least 30 days after the date of the application.
(Ord. No. 48, § 6-2, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-133. - Public notice.
Public notice of the hearing on the application for preliminary plat approval shall be given at least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to the scheduled public hearing. The director shall file a notice of public hearing which shall be published once in the newspaper of general circulation in the county setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. Such notice shall identify the property affected. Additionally, at least 15 days before the scheduled public hearing, the director shall post, in a conspicuous place on the property a sign at least two feet by three feet in size. It shall set forth the time, place and purpose of the public hearing before the planning commission. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of notice by a sign posted on the property shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken under this article.
(Ord. No. 48, § 6-3, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-134. - Preliminary plat approval.
(a)
The planning commission shall approve, disapprove or approve with modification, the preliminary plat within 45 days after the date it is presented at the public hearing. If approved, the planning commission shall indicate so in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, the planning commission shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefore. Failure of the planning commission to act within 45 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat and the public hearing is held, shall be deemed to constitute approval, and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period.
(b)
Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the planning commission. Also, noted shall be the date on which the planning commission granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent.
(c)
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified in this chapter have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(Ord. No. 48, § 6-4, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-135. - Standards for approval of preliminary plats.

No preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision shall be approved by the planning commission unless the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence that:

If a public sewage system is proposed, adequate provision has been made for such a system and, if other methods of sewage disposal are proposed, that such systems will comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations;

All proposed streets on the preliminary plat are in conformity with adopted design standards, if any, and existing and proposed public street improvements;
(4)
All areas of the proposed subdivision which may involve soil or topographical conditions presenting hazards or requiring special precautions have been identified by the subdivider and that the proposed uses of these areas are compatible with such conditions;
(5)
The subdivider has the financial ability to complete the proposed subdivision in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations;
(6)
There is not other available subdivided land in the jurisdiction of the county that would be more suitable for the applicant's proposed uses of the subdivision;
(7)
The proposed subdivision will not result in the scattered subdivision of land that leaves undeveloped parcels of land lacking urban services between developed parcels;
(8)
The subdivider has taken every effort to mitigate the impact of the proposed subdivision on public health, safety, and welfare.
(b)
The planning commission is authorized to disapprove the preliminary plat even though the land proposed for subdivision is zoned for the use to which the proposed subdivision will be put and the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan.

(Ord. No. 48, § 6-7, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-138. - Conformance to zoning and subdivision regulations.
