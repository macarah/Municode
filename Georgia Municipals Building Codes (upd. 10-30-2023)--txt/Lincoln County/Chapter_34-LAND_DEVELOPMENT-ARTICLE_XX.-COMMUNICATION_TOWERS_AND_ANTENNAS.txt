For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall be used:
Antenna means an arrangement or array of wires, dishes, or metal rods, used in transmitting or receiving electromagnetic waves.
Collocation means the placement or installation of new wireless facilities on previously approved and constructed wireless support structures, including monopoles and towers, both self-supporting and guyed, in a manner that negates the need to construct a new freestanding wireless support structure. Such term includes the placement of accessory equipment within an existing compound.
Communication(s) facility/facilities means communication tower(s), antenna(s), and associated physical and technical equipment.
Communication tower means a guyed, monopole, lattice or self-support tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, containing one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving television, AM/FM radio, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, or similar forms of electronic communication. This definition does not include a satellite earth station as regulated by section 34-731 and a structure used for amateur or recreational purposes such as a ham radio, a citizens band radio or home television antenna under 70 feet in total height.
Director means the director of the Lincoln County Planning and Zoning Department or his/her designee.
FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.
Governing body means the Board of Commissioners for Lincoln County.
Guyed tower means a guyed tower that can be either a lattice or monopole tower which has cables attached to the tower and ground to provide stability to the tower.
Lattice tower means a communication tower that generally has three or four support steel legs and holds a variety of antennas.
Monopole tower consists of a single self-supporting pole which is generally wider in diameter at the base and narrows at the top and may support any combination of whip, panel or dish antennas.
Stealth structure means a communication tower which is made to resemble an artificial tree, church steeple, cupola, bell tower, clock tower, or grain silo or similar natural or manmade alternative design mounting structure that camouflages or conceals the presence of antennas or towers and the accessory equipment.
Support structure means any structure on which one or more antennas may be mounted. The term "support structure" is inclusive of "stealth structure".
Vertical design element means an architectural feature of a building, such as a clock tower, bell tower, steeple, or other similarly designed support structure.

Applications for a new tower must include a letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the collocation potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible.
o.
A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for collocation, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of [if] approval is granted.
1.
The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users.
2.
The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge.
p.
The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
q.
Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna.
r.
Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below:
1.
The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact.
2.
Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application to include a response into the application when filed.
i.
Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval.
ii.
Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
s.
The applicant shall request the following information from each tower contacted:
1.
Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height.
2.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna.
3.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required.
4.
If structurally able, would collocation by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all.
5.
If collocation is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use.
t.
