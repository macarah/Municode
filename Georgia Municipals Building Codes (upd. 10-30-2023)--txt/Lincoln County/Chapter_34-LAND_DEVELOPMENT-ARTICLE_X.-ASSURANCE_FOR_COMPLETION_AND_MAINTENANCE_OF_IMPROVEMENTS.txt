ARTICLE X. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 34-311. - Improvements and subdivision improvement agreement.
(a)
Completion of improvements. Before the final subdivision plat is signed by the planning commission, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the planning commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the county engineer, all the street, sanitary and other public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in these regulations, specified in the final subdivision plat and as approved by the planning commission, and to dedicate those public improvements to the local government, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the dedicated property and public improvements.
(b)
Subdivision improvement agreement and guarantee.
(1)
Agreement. The board of commissioners at its sole discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final subdivision plat and, as an alternative, permit the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public improvements in accordance with the Lincoln County Code and approved plans and specifications no later than one year following the date on which the planning commission signs the final subdivision plat. The applicant shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement for a period of one year following the acceptance by the board of commissioners of the dedication of that completed public improvement and also shall warrant that all required public improvements will be free from defect for a period of two years following the acceptance by the board of commissioners of the dedication of the last completed public improvement. Planted trees must be guaranteed in accordance with section 34-284. The subdivision improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant and the board of commissioners.
(2)
Covenants to run. The subdivision improvement agreement shall provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land and bind all successors, heirs and assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision improvement agreement will be adopted by the board of commissioners, pursuant to applicable state and local laws, and shall be recorded in the clerk's office of the superior court of the county.
(3)
Security. Whenever the board of commissioners permits an applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide a letter of credit, cash escrow, or performance bond. as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. The form of such security shall be as approved by the county attorney. Either security shall be in an amount not less than 120 percent of the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements, including lot improvements and such other subdivision improvements as are necessary to protect the health, safety, or general welfare of the subdivision residents and other residents of Lincoln County, or in such other amount as the planning commission at its sole discretion determines is necessary as security. The issuer of the letter of credit, the escrow agent, or the surety on the bond, as applicable, shall be acceptable to the board of commissioners. If construction of the subdivision improvements has not begun within one year of the date the final subdivision plat was recorded, the board of commissioners reserves the right to require the subdivider to modify the approved plans and specifications to reflect any changes made in the Lincoln County Code and to increase the security for the faithful performance of the agreement.
a.
Letter of credit. If the applicant posts a letter of credit as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the credit shall:
1.
Be irrevocable;
2.
Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in subsection (b)(1) of this section; and
3.
Require only that the government present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed by the county attorney attesting to the county's right to draw funds under the credit.
b.
Cash escrow. If the applicant posts a cash escrow as security for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the escrow instructions shall provide that:
1.
The subdivider will have no right to return of any of the funds except as provided in section 34-312(b)(2); and
2.
The escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the county whenever the county attorney presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the county's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right.
c.
Bond. If the applicant posts a performance bond as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the bond shall:
1.
Be irrevocable;
2.
Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in subsection (b)(1) of this section; and
3.
Require only that the government present the surety with notice signed by the county attorney of the principal's breach of the subdivision improvement agreement.
4.
Should the government be notified that the surety becomes insolvent or otherwise shall no longer act as surety, the subdivider shall replace the bond with a new surety or provide other security as provided herein, within ten days after receiving notice from the government that the surety will no longer guarantee performance under the bond.
If and when the county accepts the offer of dedication for the last completed required public improvement, the county shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but 25 percent of the funds represented by the letter of credit, cash escrow, or bond if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the subdivider's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements are free from defect.
(4)
Extension. In the event that it is deemed necessary to extend the time for completion of the improvements, an extension may be granted by the board of commissioners and shall in no way affect the terms of the subdivision improvement agreement or release the security given for the faithful performance of the agreement. Extensions shall not exceed 18 months, shall be in writing, approved by the board of commissioners, and signed by the subdivider and county. Any request for extension shall be made by the subdivider no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the subdivision improvement agreement. In consideration of a subdivision improvement agreement extension, the following may be required:
a.
Revision of improvement plans to provide for current design and construction standards when required by the county engineer;
b.
Revised improvement construction estimates to reflect current improvement costs as approved by the county engineer;
c.
Increase of improvement security in accordance with revised construction estimates or if it is determined by the county engineer that work has not proceeded in a diligent manner;
d.
Inspection fees may be increased to reflect current construction costs but shall not be subject to any decrease or refund;
e.
Any additional requirements imposed by the board of commissioners, as recommended by the county engineer, or as deemed necessary as a condition to approving any time extension for the completion of improvements;
f.
Payment of costs incurred by the county including any engineering fees, legal costs, and attorney's fees, as a result of the subdivider's failure to timely complete the improvements; and
g.
Suspend final subdivision plat approval during which time the subdivider will have no right to sell, transfer or otherwise convey lots or homes with the subdivision without the express written approval of the county, or until the improvements are completed and accepted by the county.
(c)
Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the developer, at his expense, without reimbursement by the local government.
(d)
Failure to complete improvement. Where a subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, or satisfactory progress has not been made on the improvements, the local government may then:
(1)
Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default;
(2)
Suspend final subdivision plat approval until the improvements are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose of public notice;
(3)
Withhold issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy within the subdivision;
(4)
Obtain funds under the security and use the proceeds for engineering expenses, consultants' fees and charges, legal fees and costs, or other expenses, to complete improvements itself or through a third party;
(5)
Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent owners agreement to complete improvements in the subdivision; and
(6)
Exercise any other rights available under the law.
The subdivider hereby grants to the county, its assigns, agents, contractors, and employees, a nonexclusive right and easement to enter the property for the purposes of constructing, maintaining, and repairing such improvements.
Should the cost of completing the improvements exceed the amount available under the faithful performance guarantee, subdivider agrees to pay such excess amount to the county on demand. County shall not accept or assume any responsibility for construction, operation, or maintenance of the subdivision improvements until final completion and acceptance by the county, and no representation or forbearance by any officer or agent of the county to the contrary shall obligate the county or constitute acceptance of the improvements. Further, the public's use of such improvements prior to final completion and acceptance by deed of dedication shall not constitute an implied dedication of such improvements to the county.
(e)
Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance of the board of commissioners. The approval of a subdivision plat by the planning commission, whether preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the county of any street, easement, or park shown on the plat.
(Ord. No. 48, § 11-1, 1-9-2003; Amend. of 5-11-2006)
Sec. 34-312. - Inspection of improvements.
(a)
General procedure and fees. The board of commissioners shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the county an inspection fee based on the estimated cost of inspection, and where the improvements are completed prior to final plat approval, the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the planning commission unless the inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the county and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the director finds upon inspection that any one or more of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the county's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing the improvements.
(b)
Release or reduction of security.
(1)
Certificate of satisfactory completion. The board of commissioners will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce the amount of any security posted by the subdivider until the county engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until:
a.
The applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the county engineer, through submission of a detailed as-built survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimension, materials, and other information required by the planning commission or board of commissioners, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision; and
b.
A title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the county attorney indicating that the improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication to the local government, and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances.
Upon such approval and recommendation by the county attorney, the board of commissioners shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure.
(2)
Reduction of escrowed funds and security.
a.
If the security posted by the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount of the escrow shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a cash escrow be reduced below 25 percent of the principal amount. Funds held in escrow account shall not be released to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon express written instruction of the county attorney. At the end of the maintenance and warranty periods, all escrowed funds, if any, shall be released to the subdivider.
b.
If the security provided by the subdivider was a letter of credit, the county attorney shall execute waivers of the county's right to draw funds under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall waivers be executed that would reduce the security below 25 percent of its original amount.
c.
If the security provided by the subdivider was a bond, the county attorney shall execute waivers of the county's right to draw funds under the bond upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall waivers be executed that would reduce the security below 25 percent of its original amount.

Sec. 34-313. - Escrow deposits for lot improvements.
(a)
Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvement required by the subdivision regulations cannot be performed, the director may issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general welfare, upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the board of commissioners for the cost of the lot improvements. The subdivision improvement agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.
(b)
Procedures on escrow fund. All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted by the director at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements have not been properly installed at the end of the time period, the director shall give two weeks written notice to the developer requiring him to install the improvements, and if they are not then installed properly, the director may request the board of commissioners to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the director, the developer shall obtain and file with the building official prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser of the premises authorizing the building official to install or have installed the improvements at the end of the nine-month period if the improvements have not been duly installed by the subdivider.

Sec. 34-314. - Maintenance of improvements.
modified
The developer shall be required to maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots until acceptance of the improvements by the board of commissioners. If there are any certificates of occupancy issued on a street and the street is not dedicated to the county, the county may effect emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer. Following the acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the county, the board of commissioners may, in its sole discretion require the subdivider to maintain the improvement for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. However, under no circumstance shall the board of commissioners accept any road or street until at least 25 percent of all lots have been issued a certificate of occupancy for a residential dwelling.
(Ord. No. 48, § 11-4, 1-9-2003; Amend. of 5-11-2006; Ord. of 6-10-2021)
Sec. 34-315. - Deferral of waiver of requirement improvements.
(a)
The board of commissioners may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate condition, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or in existence of connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any public improvement must be made on the record and the reasons for the deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.
(b)
Whenever it is deemed necessary by the board of commissioners to defer the construction of any improvement required under these regulations because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the local government prior to signing of the final subdivision plat by the planning commission, or the developer may execute a separate subdivision improvement agreement secured by a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements upon demand of the county.
(Ord. No. 48, § 11-5, 1-9-2003; Amend. of 5-11-2006)
Sec. 34-316. - Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.

When a subdivision improvement agreement and security have been required for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the required public improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those improvements by the county, as required in the planning commission approval of the final subdivision plat.
(b)
The extent of street improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the county in a sum determined by the planning commission to cover the cost of the necessary final improvement of the street.
(c)
No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent of lots in a subdivision, or if ten percent is less than two, for the final two lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements required by the planning commission for the subdivision have been fully completed and the local government has accepted the developer's offers to dedicate the improvements.
