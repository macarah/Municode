Craft beer, as defined by the Brewers Association, Boulder, Colorado, the trade organization for the craft beer/microbrewing industry, are beers (a form of malt beverage) produced by a small, independent brewer who follows traditional brewing processes using select, sometimes non-traditional, ingredients to produce a distinctive product.

Eating establishment means an establishment open to the public which is licensed to sell distilled spirits, malt beverages, and/or wines for consumption on the premises and which derives at least 50% of its total annual gross food and beverage sales from the sale of prepared meals or food as its principal business purpose. In order to be licensed for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises under this chapter, eating establishments are expected to keep and maintain regular days and hours of operation, at least four (4) days per week, as a convenience to the public, other than holidays, vacations, and periods when closed for repairs or remodeling.

Premises means the definite closed or partitioned-in locality, whether room, shop or building, wherein alcoholic beverages are sold or consumed. Premises also includes any area or patio immediately adjacent to the main licensed facility and located on property owned or leased by such licensee.

Proper identification means any document issued by a government agency containing a description of the person and such person's photograph, and giving the person's date of birth; proper identification includes, but is not limited to, a passport, military identification card, driver's license, or identification card issued under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-5-100 through 40-5-104.

The term does not include cooking wine mixed with salt or other ingredients so as to render it unfit for human consumption.

B.
"Due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to:
1.
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his or her employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws.

Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages;
4.
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor; any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented;
5.
Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license;
6.
Any other factor known to or discovered by the City whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance, or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, narcotics, or disorderly conduct, including any sexual offense, under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premise consumption.
a)
With respect to this section, it shall be presumed that the violation was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee.

Provided, however, such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
C.
Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing.

The hearing shall be conducted by the mayor and council, with the mayor presiding. Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice.

At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the mayor shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability.

The mayor and council shall make its final determination within 10 days of the completion of the hearing.

( Ord. No. 17-06-19(C) , § 1, 6-19-2017)
