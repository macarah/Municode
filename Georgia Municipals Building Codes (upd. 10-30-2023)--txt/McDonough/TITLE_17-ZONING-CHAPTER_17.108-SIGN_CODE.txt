CHAPTER 17.108 - SIGN CODE

Sections:
17.108.010 - Purposes.
The purposes of the ordinance are set out in the preamble hereto and as follows herein.
a.
A comprehensive regulation is necessary because of the unique nature and history of the City of McDonough. In the decade preceding this ordinance there has been significant population growth in McDonough and Henry County. McDonough serves as the county seat of Henry County and Henry County is one of the fastest growing counties in the United States of America preceding the adoption date of this ordinance. Mcdonough has a unique historical town square and historic buildings that must be preserved for posterity.
b.
To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The City is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. The residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. City-wide regulations are necessary in view of the fact that very few areas are distinctly residential or distinctly commercial, and homes including historic homes and buildings are often found in close proximity to commercial areas; it is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surrounding in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
c.
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city.
d.
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this Chapter.
e.
The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The Mayor and Council intend by enacting this ordinance to:
1.
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
2.
Further the objections of the city's comprehensive plan;
3.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the City;
4.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
5.
Maintain the historical image of the City;
6.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
7.
Promote economic development; and
8.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

Peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance.
6.
The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision on of the lot upon which such variance was granted.

a.
If the community development director or his or her designee shall find that any sign regulated herein is unsafe or unstable, or is a menace to the public health or safety, or is abandoned, or is maintained in a dilapidated condition, or has been constructed or erected or is being maintained in violation of the provisions of this article, community development director or his or her designee shall notify the permittee, owner, or occupant of the property on which the sign is located by certified mail of such violation. Said notice shall include a brief and complete statement of the violations to be remedied. If the permittee, owner, or occupant of the property where the sign is located cannot be located, notice shall be effected by the community development director or his or her designee affixing the notice to the sign or to the building on which the sign is erected.
b.
If the permittee or property owner fails to remove or alter the structure so as to comply with the standards herein set forth within ten (10) days after such notice, the permit for such sign shall be revoked and the permittee or property owner shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Section 17.108.130.
c.
In any case in which a sign is an immediate threat to the physical safety of persons or adjoining property, the community development director or his or her designee may cause such structure to be removed summarily and without notice and cause the cost of same to be placed as a lien on the property upon which the sign sits.
17.108.100 - Nonconforming signs.
a.
Signs which, on the effective date of this article, were approved and legally erected under previous sign restrictions and which became nonconforming with respect to the requirements of this chapter restrictions:
1.
The owner of the sign shall secure a permit for the continuation of the sign subject to the restrictions of this section. Application for such permit must be filed within ten (10) days of the notice of nonconformance. There shall be no charge for this permit. Failure to apply for such permit within ten (10) days shall result in waiver of the protections afforded nonconforming signs by this section and the display of such sign shall be thereafter unlawful.
2.
No change shall be made in the size of any nonconforming sign, nor shall any structural changes be made in such a sign unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
3.
Any nonconforming sign declared to be unsafe by the community development director or his or her designee shall be removed or rendered safe and brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
4.
No nonconforming sign damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed value shall be repaired or rebuilt except in compliance with this Chapter.
5.
Any sign erected in violation of this section may be removed from any public property or right-of-way by duly authorized employees of the City, and the responsible party may be cited for such violation.
6.
No conforming sign or advertising device shall be permitted or erected on any lot which has located there upon an existing nonconforming sign until the nonconforming sign has been removed.
b.
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.
c.
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of this sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this chapter.
d.
Nonconforming signs which met all requirements of the City of McDonough Code when erected may stay in place until one of the following conditions occurs:
1.
The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard; or
2.
The sign has been damaged to such extent that structural repairs are required to restore the sign. A structural repair is any repair necessary to maintain the stability of the sign and are not merely aesthetic in nature.
e.
No structural repairs, change in shape, size or design shall be permitted on a nonconforming sign except to make the sign comply with all requirements of this chapter.
f.
If the city or any other lawfully constituted state or federal governmental authority, agency or body or utility having the authority of eminent domain condemns or acquires property in the city, and, as the sole result of such condemnation or acquisition, an existing nonconforming sign must be removed, the existing nonconforming sign may be relocated on the same lot on which the original nonconforming sign was located. In the relocation of a nonconforming sign as the result of an act of eminent domain, any nonconformities with respect to height or sign area may not be increased beyond those that exist as of the date of taking, however, the relocated sign may be relocated closer to the right-of-way than otherwise allowed by current setback requirements provided it will not impact line of sight or otherwise constitute a safety concern.
