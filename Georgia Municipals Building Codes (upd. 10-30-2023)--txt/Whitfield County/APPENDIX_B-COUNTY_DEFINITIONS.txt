For the purpose of the Whitfield County Subdivision Regulations, the definition of a subdivision is broken down into three subcategories as follows:
(1)
Exempt subdivisions of land. Divisions of land, which have the following characteristics are exempt from the subdivision regulations as set forth in this ordinance. Under such circumstances, the resulting lot dimensions must conform to the minimum lots dimensions specified in the Whitfield County Zoning Ordinance and/or the Regulations of the Whitfield County Board of Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems:

b.

c.

(2)
Minor subdivisions of land. Any division of a lot or parcel into two or more lots, building sites, parcels, or other divisions (or redivisions of the same parcel which alters lot lines) which fronts upon an existing public or private road and which does not require any new or improved road, public water, sewer service, or other utility extensions, and which is not otherwise in violation of any provision of the Whitfield County Subdivision Regulations.
(3)
Major subdivisions of land. All subdivisions not classified as exempt or minor subdivisions.
Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building as of February 16, 1990, or as of the first time thereafter that any such repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements commenced, whichever is later. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Swimming pool. A body of water in an artificial or semi-artificial receptacle or other container intended for swimming, which has a minimum depth of 18 inches of water.
Townhouse. A type of dwelling unit that is one or more stories in height which has outside, individual, front and rear entrances, is separated from other dwelling units by common party walls that are four hour fire-rated masonry construction extending from the foundation through the roof line for a minimum of three feet, occupies its own lot and is part of a contiguous group of at least three such townhouses.

The fire wall separating single-story units and units of two or more stories must extend only to the roof decking of the two-story unit.
Transfer station. A facility used to transfer solid waste from one transportation vehicle to another for transportation to a solid waste handling facility.
Travel trailer. A motorized camper, converted bus, tent-trailer, or other similar vehicular or portable structure used or designed for temporary portable housing or occupancy while on vacation or recreation, and providing sleeping accommodations.

Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs.

Variance. A modification of the strict terms of certain ordinances, as provided more specifically therein, granted either by the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners, the board of zoning appeals, or other appropriate entity as specifically set forth in the particular ordinance to be varied, where such modification will not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property such as irregular lot size, topographic or other characteristics of the land and not as the result of any action on the part of the property owner, a literal enforcement of the applicable regulation or ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship.

(1)
Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or
(2)
