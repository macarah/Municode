Sec. 18-185. - Purpose.
new
It is the intent of the council in enacting this article to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenient travel in public spaces free from intimidating conduct, threats, and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation, or that may give rise to interference with other's activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts; and
There are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive, including vocal requests for a donation or carrying or displaying a sign requesting donations; and
However, there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city, which threatens the security, privacy, and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors; and
The presence of solicitors in certain specific areas (such as near to or adjacent to automatic teller machines, adjacent to cafe tables on city sidewalks, and in public parking lots at dusk and later) create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy, freedom of movement, and personal security; and
Certain forms of solicitation impede the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety, particularly on congested sidewalks and roadways (as defined below to include highly traveled areas, lines to enter buildings or venues, or on small traffic medians of highspeed or high-volume streets and highways); and
This article is not intended impermissibly to limit an individual's right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation; rather it aims to impose specific time, place, and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances; namely, limiting aggressive panhandling, panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous, and panhandling in places where people are a "captive audience" and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations. In promulgating this article, the council seeks to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant governmental interests.
