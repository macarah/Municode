DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-31. - Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all of the unincorporated areas of the county and no business or establishment shall be undertaken, commenced or maintained without prior approval and authorization pursuant to the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 3-1-1994, § 1.03)
Sec. 10-32. - Purpose.
The purposes of this article include to:
(1)
Establish rules, regulations, procedures and standards for the licensing of adult entertainment establishments.
(2)
Foster and preserve the public health, safety, comfort and welfare, and to aid in the harmonious, orderly, aesthetically pleasing and socially beneficial development of the county.
(3)
Regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed.
This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
(Ord. of 3-1-1994, § 1.04)
Sec. 10-33. - Findings.
The board of commissioners finds that many types of criminal activity may be engendered by the types of activities which are regulated in this article. These criminal activities are a drain on law enforcement resources. A consequential result of such criminal activity is the decline of county neighborhoods and property values. In looking to neighboring jurisdiction, the board of commissioners recognizes the detrimental and deleterious effects brought about by these activities. The board of commissioners finds it to be in the public interest to vigorously, within the bounds of the law, regulate and control adult entertainment establishments to avoid, to the extent possible, the undesirable consequences of such activities.
(Ord. of 3-1-1994, § 1.05)
Sec. 10-34. - Unlawful operation.
Any adult entertainment establishment operated, conducted or maintained contrary to the provisions of this article shall be and is declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The county may, in addition to or in lieu of all other remedies, commence an action, proceeding for abatement, removal or enjoinment thereof, in the manner provided by law. No adult entertainment establishment shall be conducted on any premises which does not comply with all zoning, building code, fire and other ordinances and laws of the county and the state or with any restrictive covenants that may apply to the property where such establishment may be located.
(Ord. of 3-1-1994, § 1.06)
Sec. 10-35. - Responsibility for interpretation.
If any question arises concerning the application of the rules, regulations, definitions or any interpretation of any provision of this article, the license review board shall be responsible for such interpretation. An applicant or licensee may appeal the interpretation of the license review board in accordance with the provisions in this article.
(Ord. of 3-1-1994, § 1.08)
Sec. 10-36. - Order of governance.
Whenever the provisions and requirements of this article, or of any rule, regulation or order pursuant to this article, are more restrictive than those under any other statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance or order of the county, state or the United States, the provisions and requirements of this article, then the rules, regulations and orders pursuant to this article shall govern to the extent permissible by law. Whenever the provisions of any other statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance or order of the county, state or the United States are more restrictive than this article, or any rule, other statute, law, rule, regulation or order pursuant to this article, then the provisions of such other statute, law, rule, regulation ordinance or order shall govern.

Sec. 10-99. - Additional considerations.
In addition to other requirements set forth in this division, the following requirements and conditions shall be considered in determining whether an adult entertainment establishment license may be approved, renewed, revoked, suspended or retained:
(1)
There is evidence that, even though there is compliance with the minimum distance requirements set forth in section 10-48, the type and number of schools or number of churches or other facilities in the vicinity cause minors to frequent the immediate area of the adult entertainment establishment premises.
(2)
There is evidence that the location or type of structure creates difficulty in law enforcement supervision of the adult entertainment establishment premises.
(3)
There is evidence that there are no licenses granted in the area or where there is evidence that the proposed area is already adequately supplied with such licenses.
(4)
There is evidence that a license for the location would be detrimental to the property values in the area.
(5)
There is evidence that a license in a location is detrimental to traffic conditions or that there is a lack of sufficient parking space. In addition to compliance with any other parking space requirements of this article, a licensee shall have sufficient parking on the premises so as to provide parking for his customers and so as to prevent parking on the street or adjoining property.
(6)
There is evidence that alcoholic beverages have been possessed, sold or consumed in violation of any law, rule, regulation or ordinance.
(7)
There is evidence that the conduct of the business has violated any law or this article, creates a disturbance, results in a congregation of intoxicated or unruly persons, results in a congregation of minors, allows minors to be on the premises or to purchase, drink or possess alcoholic beverages on the premises, or is such that illegal activities have occurred on or in connection with the premises or business, or causes the sheriff's office to answer complaints or make extra surveillance of the premises.
(8)
In addition to the conditions set forth in subsections (1)—(7) of this section, and in determining whether or not any license applied for shall be granted, the following shall be considered in the public interest and welfare:
a.
If the applicant is a previous holder of any special license under this division or of an alcoholic beverage license, the manner in which such licensed business is conducted as to the necessity for unusual law enforcement observation and inspection in order to prevent the violation of any law, regulation or ordinance relating to such business.
b.
The location for which the license is sought as to traffic congestion, general character of the neighborhood and the effect such an establishment would have on the adjacent and surrounding property values.
c.
The number of licenses already granted for similar businesses in the trading area of the place for which the license is sought.
d.
If it reasonably appears another person is using the applicant as a guise or dummy to obtain a license and such other person shall not be able to meet the qualifications of an applicant for a license under this division.
A finding that any of the conditions set forth in subsections (1)—(8) of this section exist, or a violation of this or other sections of this article exist, shall be grounds for denial of an original or renewal application and shall authorize the license review board to suspend, revoke or place on probation, with or without conditions, the license or holder of an existing license. The license review board may specify conditions of operation of the licensee during any time of probation. Such conditions shall be in writing and remain on file with the license review board with a copy sent by certified mail or personal delivery to the licensee. No probation shall extend over a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive calendar months.

The notice shall be delivered to the applicant either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

Sec. 10-102. - Mandatory denial.
No adult entertainment establishment license shall be issued to an applicant if, within twelve (12) months immediately preceding the filing of an application for such license, one (1) or more of the following shall have occurred:

(2)
The location for such business has been rejected for any applicant.
(3)
The applicant has withdrawn, without permission of the license review board, an application at any time within seven (7) days immediately preceding the time and date set for the hearing before the license review board unless at least one (1) year shall have expired from such withdrawal.

Sec. 10-103. - Transferability.
(a)
No adult entertainment establishment license shall be sold, given, transferred or assigned by any licensee or by operation of law, to any other person or entity. Any such sale, gift, transfer or assignment, or attempted sale, gift, transfer or assignment, shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of the license and such license shall thereafter be null and void; provided, however, if the licensee is a partnership or corporation and one (1) or more of the partners or shareholders should die, one (1) or more of the surviving partners or shareholders who were partners or shareholders at the time of issuance of the license may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or shareholder without effecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case, the licensee shall immediately notify the license review board. A license issued to a corporation shall be deemed terminated and void when either any outstanding stock of the corporation is sold, transferred or assigned after the issuance of a license, or any stock authorized but not issued at the time of the granting of a license is thereafter issued and sold, transferred or assigned. Any attempt to transfer or assign any interest as prohibited in this section, whether temporarily or permanently, and whether or not with reservation of rights, shall constitute a criminal violation of this article.
(b)
No licensee shall change the name or location of an adult entertainment establishment without first obtaining a new license.
(c)
If the license review board has cause to believe that a license has been assigned or transferred, or that an adult entertainment establishment has been sold, leased or has had control over it transferred, or that any such activity is about to occur, the license review board may immediately, or at any time, seek appropriate equitable and injunctive relief.
