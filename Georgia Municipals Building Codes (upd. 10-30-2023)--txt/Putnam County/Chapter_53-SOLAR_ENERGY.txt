Chapter 53 - SOLAR ENERGY

Sec. 53-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate the siting, construction, installation, and decommissioning of solar energy systems (SESs) in Putnam County in a manner that encourages local economic development and protects the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Putnam County and at the same time mitigates any adverse impacts to wildlife, agricultural lands, forests, and other natural landscapes.
The intent of this chapter is to increase energy security, to promote the use of Georgia-based energy resources, to decrease the cost of energy, to bolster local economic development and employment prospects, to increase consumers' choices in energy consumption, to encourage the use of a renewable energy resource, to support Putnam County's sustainability agenda, and to reduce air and water pollution.
A solar energy system shall be permitted in any zoning district as an accessory use, subject to specific criteria as set forth below. Where general standards and specific criteria overlap, specific criteria shall supersede general standards.
(Ord. of 7-10-2020 (1))
Sec. 53-2. - Definitions.
Accessory use means a subordinate building or use which is customarily incidental to the principal use or building, and which is located on the same lot with the principal use or building, as defined in section 66-20 of this Code.
Battery back-up means a battery system that stores electrical energy from a solar PV system, making the electricity available for future use.
Building-integrated system means any solar energy system consisting of solar panels that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope or architectural features such as the roof, skylights, windows, awnings, or façades.
Combiner or junction box means a unit or device where inputs from multiple strings of solar panels (or micro-inverters) are combined into one output circuit.
Crystalline silicon cells means solar photovoltaic cells fashioned from either mono-crystalline, multi-crystalline, or ribbon silicon capable of converting sunlight into electricity.
Distributed solar means any solar energy systems located on-site and designed to serve the energy needs of the building, structure, or facility to which it is connected.

Hybrid solar photovoltaic systems (aka grid-tied PV with battery back-up) means any solar photovoltaic electricity generation systems designed to serve the electricity needs of the building to which it is connected, thus offsetting a home's or business's electricity usage, while also utilizing a battery back-up in the event of a power outage, including, but not limited to, PV panels, inverter(s), and required electrical safety equipment, battery bank, and a charge controller.
Inverter means any device that converts the Direct Current (DC) electricity produced by a solar photovoltaic system to alternating current (AC).
Mounting means the manner in which solar PV panels are affixed to the roof or ground (i.e. roof mount, ground mount, pole mount, or building integrated).

Solar easement means an easement recorded pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 44-9-20—44-9-24, the purpose of which is to secure the right to receive sunlight across the real property of another for the continued access to sunlight necessary to operate a solar energy system.
Solar energy system means any system capable of collecting and converting solar radiation into heat, mechanical, or electrical energy and transferring these forms of energy to storage or to point of use, including, but not limited to, water heating, space heating or cooling, electric energy generation, or mechanical energy generation. This definition shall include solar thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar systems.

Solar glare means the potential for solar panels to reflect sunlight, with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
Solar photovoltaic (Solar PV) system means solar systems consisting of photovoltaic cells, made with semiconducting materials, that produce electricity (in the form of direct current (DC)) when they are exposed to sunlight. A typical PV system consists of PV panels (or modules) that combine to form an array; other system components may include mounting racks and hardware, wiring for electrical connections, and power conditioning equipment, such as an inverter and/or battery.
Solar panel or module means a device for the direct conversion of sunlight into useable solar energy (including electricity or heat).
Solar process heat means technologies that provide industrial specific applications, including ventilation air preheating, solar process heating, and solar cooling.
Solar-ready means the concept of planning and building with the purpose of enabling future use of solar energy systems.
Solar thermal system (aka solar hot water or solar heating systems) means any solar energy system that directly heats water, air, or other fluid (such as an antifreeze solution) using sunlight.

(f)
The plan for development of any site within cluster subdivisions shall be designed and arranged in such a way as to promote solar access for all dwelling units. Considerations may include the following:
(1)
In order to maximize solar access, the higher-density dwelling units should be placed on a south-facing slope and lower-density dwelling units sited on a north-facing slope.
(2)
A tall structure should be sited to the north of a short structure.
