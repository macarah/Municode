Sec. 30-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans for such activities. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-33(b) [and] (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity not exempt from the provisions of this article and the NPDES General Permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 30-33(b) [and] (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this paragraph 2 of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit for issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 Nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm-water fisheries or by more than ten Nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which the failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 30-33(c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the current Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential.
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented.
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable.
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills.
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property.
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners.
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsections 30-33(b)(2) of this article.
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure is to be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkhead and seawalls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the down stream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.

There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in Water Quality Control, chapter 391-3-7-.01(r), at www.edp.georgia.gov, provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 30-33(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.

Land Disturbance Permit Application Fee Schedule
1—5 acres, per disturbed acre $100.00
5.1—10 acres, per disturbed acre 60.00
10.1+ acres, per disturbed acre 20.00
  Examples:
1.
For 14 acres of disturbed land the fee is calculated as such:
5 × ($100.00) + 5 × ($60.00) + 4 × ($20.00) = $880.00
2.
For seven acres of disturbed land the fee is calculated as such:
5 × ($100.00) + 2 × ($60.00) = $620.00
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8, half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 30-33(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-34(b)(6), has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

Sec. 30-44. - Groundwater recharge area districts.
Groundwater recharge areas are vulnerable to residential and commercial development activities and agricultural activities. Development usually causes an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in groundwater recharge areas can alter or impair the recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing the supply of groundwater. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste, and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in groundwater quality and can threaten the health of people who rely on water drawn from wells.
(1)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area districts in Putnam County are shown on and identified as such on DNR's Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (current edition), as supplemented by the Putnam County Groundwater Recharge Areas Map. At the time of adoption of this article, all of Putnam County has been designated as an area with low pollution susceptibility on DNR's Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20.
(2)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within groundwater recharge areas shall be as follows:
a.
There shall be no landfills.
b.
There shall be no new permits for the land disposal of hazardous waste.
c.
Facilities permitted or to be permitted to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste shall perform such operations on an impermeable pad having a spill and leak collection system.
d.
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a volume of 660 gallons or more shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
e.
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
1.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in capacity; or
3.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in capacity.
Any liner required by this subsection shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of at least one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The average size of existing agricultural waste impoundments in Putnam County is about 15 acre-feet. The recommended vertical hydraulic conductivity in clay can be compacted by the use of sheep's-foot rollers or pans with heavy rubber tires.
f.
New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DHR Table MT-1). These minimum lot sizes may be increased based on consideration of other factors as set out in §§ A—F of the DHR manual.
1.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
3.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
g.
New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DHR Table MT-2). These minimum lot sizes may be increased based on consideration of other factors as set out in §§ A—F of the DHR manual.
1.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
2.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and
3.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
h.
If the applicable zoning ordinance requires a larger lot size than that required by subsections f. and g., the larger lot size shall be used.
i.
Any lot of record on the date of the adoption of this article shall be exempt from the lot size standards required by subsections f. and g.
j.
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the DHR Manual and the lot size standards required by subsections f. and g.
k.
Facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in § 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces and in accordance with any applicable federal or state spill prevention requirements and state and local fire code requirements.
l.
The design of any new facility for the spray irrigation of wastewater sludge in any high pollution susceptibility area shall comply with DNR's Criteria For Slow Rate Land Treatment (current edition), as amended, and other technical publications, as well as site-specific information submitted by a registered professional engineer for each such project.
m.
Permanent storm water infiltration basins shall not be constructed in any high pollution susceptibility area.
n.
Exclusive of mining settling basins, new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner in any high pollution susceptibility area.

Sec. 30-45. - Wetlands districts.
(a)
[Defined, identified.] The wetlands within Putnam County are indispensable and fragile natural resources and in which development activities are significantly restrained because of flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide fish, wildlife, and vegetation habitats, water quality maintenance, water pollution control, flood control, natural resource education, opportunity for scientific study, and recreation.
The following categories of freshwater wetlands and aquatic habitats have been defined, identified, and mapped by DNR:
(1)
Open water. Areas of open water, primarily reservoirs, ponds, lakes, rivers, and estuaries.
(2)
Nonforested emergent wetlands. Freshwater marshes dominated by a variety of grasses, sedges, rushes, and broad-leaved aquatics associated with streams, pond areas, and tidally-influenced nonsaline waters.
(3)
Scrub/shrub wetlands. Nonforested areas dominated by woody shrubs, seedlings, and saplings averaging less than 20 feet in height; these wetlands may intergrade with forested wetlands, nonforested emergent wetlands, and open water.
(4)
Forested wetlands. Natural or planted forested areas having a dominant tree crown closure of hardwoods, pines, gums, cypress, or any combination of these types. These areas are usually in stream or river floodplains, isolated depressions, and drainways, and contain standing or flowing water for a portion of the year. Subcategories are:
a.
Hardwood floodplain forests;
b.
Coniferous floodplain forests;
c.
Mixed floodplain forests;
d.
Nonalluvial forested wetlands.
(5)
Altered wetlands. Areas with hydric soils that have been denuded of natural vegetation and put to other uses, such as pasture, row crops, etc., but that otherwise retain certain wetlands functions and values.
(b)
District delineation. The wetlands area districts in Putnam County are shown on and identified as such on the Little River Watershed and Wetland Delineation Map. Said overlay map is a generalized wetlands map and shows the general location of wetlands according to the 1987 National Wetlands Inventory and should be consulted by persons considering development activities in or near wetlands. However, this map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Putnam County and shall not serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by § 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
(c)
Permit coordination process. In order to assure that all applicable federal and state requirements in regard to wetlands are met, the local issuing authority of Putnam County shall compare all requests for subdivision, rezoning, development, construction, demolition, or land disturbance to the generalized wetlands map. This review is simply a coordination process and is not an additional wetlands permitting process. No action by the Putnam County or its employees shall relieve a landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. This review shall result in one of two actions by the local issuing authority:
(1)
He shall issue a local permit pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance of Putnam County of 1997 or the Putnam County Land Disturbance Ordinance without requiring a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the Corps of Engineers if either of the following two conditions exists:
a.
The request does not involve an activity which would cause alteration of wetlands; or
b.
The request involves a location which is not near or within a protected wetland boundary as shown on the generalized wetlands map.
(2)
He shall not issue a local permit but shall defer issuing any local permit pending a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the Corps of Engineers and shall issue such a permit only after either a letter of permission or a § 404 permit is issued by the Corps of Engineers whenever his review determines that the request appears to involve land which contains wetlands or is located near wetlands so as to have a potential to alter them.
(d)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within wetlands districts shall be as follows:
(1)
No landfills shall be allowed.
(2)
No receiving areas or transfer points for toxic waste, hazardous waste, or other potential contaminants shall be allowed.
(3)
No permit for construction or development within the wetlands districts shall issue without action by the local issuing authority, the planning and zoning commission and the governing authority of Putnam County, which shall consider the following factors and issue written findings in regard thereto before issuing such a permit:
a.
Whether impacts to an area would adversely affect the public health safety, welfare, or the property of others.
b.
Whether the area is unique or significant in the conservation of flora and fauna including threatened, rare, or endangered species.
c.
Whether alteration or impacts to wetlands will adversely affect the function including the flow or quality of water, cause erosion or shoaling, or impact navigation.
d.
Whether impacts or modification by a project would adversely affect fishing or recreational use of wetlands.
e.
Whether an alteration or impact would be temporary in nature.
f.
Whether the project contains significant state historical and archaeological resources, defined as "Properties On or Eligible for the National Register of Historic Places".
g.
Whether alteration of wetlands would have measurable adverse impacts on adjacent sensitive natural areas.
h.
Where wetlands have been created for mitigation purposes under § 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act, such wetlands shall be considered for protection.
(e)
Permitted uses. Unless otherwise prohibited by the zoning ordinance, the following uses shall be permitted by right within the wetlands districts:
(1)
Forestry activities which comply with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission, to include road construction best management practices which comply with § 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
(2)
Passive outdoor recreational activities, to include fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(4)
Normal agricultural activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock, subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.

Sec. 30-46. - Water supply watershed districts.
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate, safe drinking water is essential. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff is threatened by both residential and commercial development. Land disturbing activities can increase erosion and sedimentation which can, in turn, threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs. Storm water runoff from impervious surfaces can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more difficult and expensive and making the resulting sewage more dangerous to humans and wildlife. To control and alleviate these problems and to protect public water supplies, water supply watershed districts shall be created as prescribed herein.
(1)
District delineation. The water supply watershed districts in Putnam County are shown on and identified as such on the Little River Watershed and Wetland Delineation Map. These districts are defined as that area surrounded by the ridge lines of the respective watersheds upstream of a reservoir or government-owned water system intake and are divided for regulatory purposes by the arc formed by a radius seven miles upstream of each respective public water supply intake.
(2)
Limitations on land use. In addition to the provisions of the zoning ordinance, limitations on land use within water supply watershed districts shall be as follows:
a.
No landfills shall be allowed.
b.
The corridors of all perennial streams in a large water supply watershed tributary to a water supply reservoir within a seven mile radius of the reservoir boundary shall be protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields shall be prohibited in the setback area of subsection 2., above.
c.
A tributary to the water supply intake in a large water supply watershed shall have no specified minimum criteria for protection, except that new facilities located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir and which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in § 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by DNR.
d.
The perennial stream corridors of a small water supply watershed within a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmental-owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir shall be protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields are prohibited within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
e.
The perennial stream corridors within a small water supply watershed and outside a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir are protected by the following criteria:
1.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
f.
The following criteria apply at all locations in a small water supply watershed:
1.
New hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities shall be prohibited.
2.
The impervious surface area, including all public and private structures, utilities, or facilities, of the entire water supply watershed shall be limited to 25 percent of the total area.
3.
Facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types and amounts determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall perform their operations on an impermeable surface having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by the Department of Natural Resources.
g.
The owner of any water supply reservoir shall develop a reservoir management plan for approval of the governing authority of Putnam County and the Department of Natural Resources. Said reservoir management plan shall address the recreational use of the reservoir and the maintenance of a buffer around the reservoir. Prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the following recreational uses shall be addressed in the reservoir management plan to protect the water quality of the reservoir for drinking purposes while optimizing its recreational benefits: swimming, fishing, boating, docks, and public access. Furthermore, said plan shall mandate that a buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the reservoir boundary. The allowable buffer vegetation and disturbance shall be specified in the reservoir management plan. Reservoir owners, upon consideration of ground slopes and soil types, may adopt buffers of differing sizes only upon approval of the governing authority of Putnam County and the Department of Natural Resources.
(3)
Partial exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this section, provided that the conditions described herein have been met:
a.
Land uses existing prior to the adoption of this article.
b.
Mining activities permitted by the Department of Natural Resources under the Surface Mining Act.
c.
Utilities shall be exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions of this article if the utilities to be located in the buffer or setback areas cannot feasibly be located outside these areas and if the following conditions are met:
1.
The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible.
2.
The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such as to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible.
3.
The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
d.
Forestry and agricultural activities shall be exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions of this article provided that the following conditions are met:
1.
The activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission or the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
2.
The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
