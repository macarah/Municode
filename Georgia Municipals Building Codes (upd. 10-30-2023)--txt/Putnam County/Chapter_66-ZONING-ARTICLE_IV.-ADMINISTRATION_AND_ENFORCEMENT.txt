Authorized action by the planning and zoning commission or the board of commissioners, with respect to any motion pending before it, consists of one of the following: Approval, approval with conditions, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, or deferral to a time certain. Additionally, the board of commissioners may remand the proposed action for further consideration by the planning and zoning commission. Any vote shall be by roll call. A tie vote acts as a denial.

The new official zoning maps may correct drafting or other omissions or errors in the prior maps.

Unless the prior official zoning maps have been lost or wholly destroyed, such documents, or any remaining significant parts thereof, shall be preserved, together with any significant records pertaining to its adoption or amendment, as a guide to prior zoning status of areas.

(Res. of 7-17-2007(4); Amend. of 1-12-2010)
Sec. 66-165. - Action on rezoning application or text amendment.
(a)
Hearing. The planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners shall hold public hearings on each application or text amendment as provided in section 66-162.
(b)
Director's reports.
(1)
The director of the planning and development department at the public hearings shall state staff's recommendation for each application or text amendment after hearing proponents and opponents issues.
(2)
For the BOC hearing, the director will also state the planning and zoning recommendation.
(c)
Considerations. In addition, the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners shall, with respect to each application or text amendment, consider each of the matters set forth in subsection (d) of this section, the opinions and findings of the technical review process and the recommendation of the director of the planning and development department.
(d)
Standards governing consideration of a zoning change. All amendments to the zoning map shall be viewed by the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners in light of the following standards used to determine the balance between an individual's unrestricted right to the use of his or her property and the public's right to the protection of its health, safety, morality, or general welfare of the community. These standards shall be printed and copies thereof shall be available to the general public during regular business hours. Emphasis may be placed on those criteria most applicable to the specific use proposed:
(1)
Is the proposed use consistent with the stated purpose of the zoning district that is being requested?
(2)
Is the proposed use suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property?
(3)
Will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use, value or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
(4)
Is the proposed use compatible with the purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan?
(5)
Are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned?
(6)
Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services or exceed the present or funded capabilities, including, but not limited to, streets, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection?
(7)
Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the comprehensive plan or reflected in the existing zoning on the property or surrounding properties?
(8)
Does the proposed use reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, and a reasonable private use of the subject property?
(9)
In addition to the standards enumerated in items (1)—(8) of this section, the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners may consider the following standards in a rezoning application if applicable:
a.
Duration for which the property has been vacant;
b.
Development patterns and trends in the community; and
c.
Potential air, water, noise and light pollution.
(e)
Amendments to the application or to text amendments.
(1)
The planning and zoning commission may recommend amendments to an applicant's request which would: reduce the land area, change the district requested, number of dwelling units, locations of ingress and egress, and building height. The planning and zoning commission may also apply buffers, increase setbacks and hours of operation and impose conditions of rezoning, which may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, and the health, public safety and general welfare are secured.
(2)
The board of commissioners is hereby authorized also to enter into a development agreement setting forth the conditions placed on the approval of a zoning application. The development agreement will be referred to the planning and zoning commission to draft the conditions and terms before resubmitting to the board of commissioners for approval.
(3)
If the request is for a rezoning of a portion of a parcel or shall result in the combination of multiple parcels or a portion of multiple parcels, the approval of such rezoning shall be conditioned upon the resurveying and recordation in the Superior Court of Putnam County of an accurate plat within 60 days of approval by the board of commissioners. A copy of the recorded plat shall be filed with the planning and development department director. Failure to file a plat pursuant to this subsection shall have the effect of invalidating the rezoning action. If conditions have been made to the rezoning approval, the new zoning district designation on the official zoning maps shall include an asterisk (*), such conditions being reflected in the official minutes of the meeting of the board of commissioners.
(f)
Planning and zoning commission's and board of commissioners' decisions.
(1)
The planning and zoning commission may recommend approval or deny the application, or change, reduce or modify any part of the application to best achieve a balance between rights of the applicant and the public interest.
(2)
The board of commissioners may grant approval or deny the application, or change, reduce or modify any part of the application to best achieve a balance between rights of the applicant and the public interest.
(3)
The planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners may defer its vote to another hearing date, or allow an application to be withdrawn with or without prejudice with respect to the 12-month limitation of this division. An action by the planning and zoning commission or the board of commissioners to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered. However, if the second public hearing will allow continued presentation of positions or information by proponents or opponents, the deferred hearing also shall be readvertised in compliance with section 66-163.
(g)
Communication to property owner after approval. After each application has been disposed of by the board of commissioners, the property owner shall receive notification from the director of the planning and development department of the zoning change and the conditions related thereto. The director shall also notify the property owner to survey and plat new divisions of property for recording, if applicable.
(h)
File maintenance. The department of the planning and development shall maintain a file containing each application, which shall remain current throughout the development's construction to completion. The file shall contain references to all other permits issued pursuant to the approval of the rezoning. The department may maintain a summary of the pertinent data and status of the development in a computer database.
