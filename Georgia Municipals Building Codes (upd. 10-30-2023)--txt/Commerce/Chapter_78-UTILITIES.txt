(Code 1987, § 10-104; Ord. No. 2014-008, 11-14-14)
Sec. 78-5. - Sewer user cost recovery system.
(a)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Combination industrial/nonindustrial wastewater discharger means a person discharging both industrial and sanitary wastewater to the public sewer, provided that industrial wastes are discharged separately from sanitary wastes. Where industrial and sanitary wastes are combined prior to discharge to the public sewer, the entire flow will be considered industrial waste.
Industrial wastewater discharger means a person discharging industrial wastewater to the public sewer.
Nonindustrial wastewater discharger means a person discharging sanitary wastewater to the public sewer.
Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meanings of terms used in this section shall be the same as stated in section 78-71.
(b)
Determination. The monthly sewer user charge for wastewater discharges (both industrial and nonindustrial) within the city limits shall be computed from the following formula with a minimum charge as set by the city council:
(1)
The monthly sewer user charge for wastewater dischargers (both industrial and nonindustrial) outside the city limits shall be as determined from time to time by city council, with a minimum charge as set by the city council.
(2)
Determination of the various cost factors, pollutant concentrations and discharged volumes shall be as follows:
a.
Cost factors shall be computed annually using cost data attributable to each factor.
b.
Pollutant concentration for nonindustrial wastewater dischargers shall remain constant at 225 milligrams per liter, and for industrial wastewater dischargers shall be as analyzed with a minimum of 225 milligrams per liter BOD and suspended solids concentrations for combination industrial/nonindustrial wastewater dischargers will be assumed to be 225 milligrams per liter for nonindustrial flows and shall be as measured for industrial flows.
c.
Wastewater discharge volume for nonindustrial dischargers shall be 100 percent of water used. Wastewater discharge volume for industrial dis- chargers shall be the actual volume discharged to the public sewer as measured. Wastewater discharge volume for the nonindustrial portion of combination dischargers shall be assumed to be 25 gallons per employee per day.
d.
Treatment plant capacity shall remain constant at 2.1 mgd until treatment facilities are expanded while V shall vary and be as measured at the sewage treatment plant. Adjustments in V shall be made at least annually but may be adjusted more frequently to reflect any major change in actual wastewater volume being received.
(3)
Minimum monthly charges for sewer service are established in recognition of the fact that administrative costs related to each customer are unaffected by the volume of sewage generated. Minimum charges therefor ensure that the costs of record keeping and billing are recovered even when only nominal amounts of wastes are being discharged.
(4)
User charges for customers outside of the city limits are set at a higher rate established by the city council than for those inside the city limits in recognition of the fact that all public services provided by the city are supported at least indirectly by the general tax revenues of persons inside the city. An incentive is thus maintained for unincorporated areas to apply for annexation into the city and become a part of the general tax base, supporting all the city services.
(c)
Measurements. Measurement and analysis of industrial wastewater discharged shall be performed in the manner prescribed in sections 78-80(h) and 78-80(i). Measurement and analysis of industrial wastewater dischargers shall be performed by the city at least yearly to determine the discharger's waste characteristics and cost recovery charges.
(d)
Records. The city will maintain records to verify compliance with this section and accurately record all revenues and expenditures of funds obtained through the sewer user cost recovery system. Documentation will also include records of wastewater measurements and tests, and calculations of recovery charges.

No service charge, other than the connection fee referred to in section 78-3, shall be made for a five-eighths-inch by three-fourths-inch meter. A proportionately greater charge than the connection fee specified above shall be made for a meter of larger dimensions.
(1)
The city may make connections to service other properties not adjacent to its lines upon payment of reasonable costs for the extensions of its distribution lines as may be required to render such service.
(2)
The city may install its meter at or near the property line or, at the city's option, on the consumer's property within three feet of the property line.
(3)

The consumer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use such water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, nor other purposes, except when water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard for these rules shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuance of service.
(1)
Where a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a consumer, a suitable place shall be provided by the consumer therefor, unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.
(2)
The consumer shall furnish and maintain a private cutoff valve on the consumer's side of the meter.
(3)
The consumer's piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the consumer, at his expense, in a safe and efficient manner and in accordance with the sanitary regulations of the state health department.
(4)

The failure of water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following penalties:
(1)
Nonpayment within ten days from the due date shall result in a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account.
(2)
Nonpayment within 20 days from the due date shall result in the water being shut off from the water user's property.
(3)
Nonpayment within 40 days after the original due date will allow the city in addition to all other rights and remedies, to terminate agreement between the city and the consumer; and in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to supply, any water under this agreement.
(b)
Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after bills are paid in full, such security deposit as may be required by the city council is made, and a service charge in an amount set forth by the city council is paid for each meter reconnected.

Sec. 78-82. - Fats, oil, and grease.
(a)
Definitions.
Existing facility: A building in place prior to move-in by a new or current business.
Fats, oils, and greases (FOG): Any substance such as a vegetable or animal product that is used in, or is a by-product of, the food preparation process, that turns or may turn viscous or solidifies or may solidify with a change in temperature or other conditions.
GMP official: A member of the staff of the city grease management program.
Grease hauler: A person who collects contents of grease interceptor or trap and transports it to approved recycling or disposal facility.
Grease trap/interceptor: A device used to allow sewerage to be retained so that grease and solids will separate from the water into layers before the water is allowed to flow into the city sewer system.
Grey water: All water of the liquid contained in a grease interceptor that lies below the floating grease layer and above the food solids layer.
New facility: An individual newly constructed one occupancy building or strip mall type building, or an expanded/renovated existing facility where such facilities did not previously exist.
User: Any food establishment, or other facility as defined below, which discharges wastewater into the city's sewer system.
(b)
General. Except where more complete pretreatment may be required; fat, oil, grease and/or sand interceptors shall be provided at all service stations, commercial or industrial food handling establishments and reed mills. Additionally, any other commercial, industrial establishment or any institution generating a wastewater containing greater than 100 mg/L FOG shall provide an appropriate interception device. Such devices shall be necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, and/or oil in excessive amounts, any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients except that such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and/or superintendent.
(c)
Grease trap requirements
(1)
Outdoor grease trap design and installation shall conform to the City of Commerce Sanitary Sewer Standards, as shown in figures 1 and 2, and shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director. It shall be sufficiently sized (no smaller than 1,000 gallons and not larger the 3,000 gallons) in order to achieve and maintain compliance as indicated under subsection (b). In certain cases, multiple interceptors may be utilized. All grease traps must be approved by the wastewater supervisor prior to installation.
The trap shall be located with easy access for cleaning, pump-out and official inspection. All scullery sinks, mop sinks, floor drains, dishwashers, hub drains and open receptacles shall drain to the outside grease trap. Dishwasher and food grinder wastewater shall be discharged through a suitably sized solids interceptor prior to emptying to the outdoor grease trap.
(2)
The city may approve installation of an indoor trap if site restrictions prevent an outdoor trap installation. A variance must be applied for and approved, per the variance procedures in 78-82(d)(6). The minimum size for an indoor trap is 50 pounds. All drains shall be installed similarly as described for the outdoor type. (It is prohibited to discharge wastewater with a temperature higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit, acid, or caustic trap cleaners into an indoor grease trap.)
(3)
Mechanically operated grease traps (i.e.: Big Dipper, skimmers, etc.) may be used in lieu of the grease trap requirements outlined in this section ONLY at the discretion of the director on a case-by-case basis.
(4)
A sampling point shall also be provided at the user's expense to allow for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewater. It shall be located on the effluent discharge side of the grease trap. The sampling point shall be maintained, kept safe and accessible to the city at all times.
(5)
If an existing facility has no grease trap or, as documented by inspection, it is determined that the current grease trap is insufficient for the volume of FOG waste being treated, the city may require an upgraded trap of an adequate size including a sampling point as described in subsection (4) above. An existing trap may be determined to be insufficient if the business located in the facility changes. If an existing facility using only a mechanical trap is found to be in noncompliance three times within six months, the user will be required to upgrade to a new installation as outlined under subsections (1)—(4) above. (Ref. subsection (e)). If an upgrade the existing trap is not feasible due to size and area restrictions, the variance procedure in section (d)(6) of this section must be followed.
(d)
Grease management program.
(1)
Inspection, cleaning, and maintenance. The user will be responsible for inspection and cleaning of grease traps. Outdoor grease interceptor maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every 12 weeks. Indoor grease interceptor maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every four weeks. However, food service establishments that serve or prepare 500 to 1,000 servings per month may be serviced not less than every six months and those serving fewer than 500 servings per month may be serviced not less than every 12 months. All maintenance frequencies above are contingent on the interceptor discharge concentrations not exceeding permissible FOG concentrations stated. Receipts of this service must be submitted to the City of Commerce on a monthly basis, on the 15 day of each month. If a receipt verifying service is not provided, citations and fines will be issued. After three months, the city will provide maintenance to the grease trap and will bill the user for the cost incurred. All repairs and maintenance of grease traps are the responsibility of the owner.
(2)
Inspection. Grease traps shall be inspected by the city as necessary to assure proper efficiency of the grease trap is being achieved.
(3)
Repairs. The food service facility shall be responsible for the cost and scheduling of all repairs to its grease trap(s). Repairs required by a GMP official shall be completed within 30 calendar days after the date of written notice of required repairs is received by the facility unless the city approves in writing of a different schedule.
(4)
FOG waste haulers. Waste haulers must have written permission from the city, in order to return any gray water back into the grease interceptor. This permission will be granted on a case-by-case basis and will depend upon the methods by which the solids and grease are separated in order to assure that clear water is the only material returned to the grease interceptor. All FOG waste haulers must be on the city environmental protection division list of FOG commercial transporter list. FOG numbers must be provided to city officials at any time and listed on each receipt and invoice.
(5)
Interceptor pumping frequency. Each facility's outdoor grease interceptor will be pumped at least once every 12 weeks. Indoor grease interceptors will be pumped at least once every four weeks. The city also has the right to pump a facilities' grease interceptor more frequently if the city determines it to be necessary or prudent.
(6)
Variance procedure. This procedure must be followed if a food service facility determines that pumping once every 12 weeks is excessive or that an indoor trap is necessary, then the facility may make written application for a variance from the above-described pumping schedule.
a.
The food service will submit an application on a form provided by the city.
b.
At the time which the grease interceptor is due to be pumped a representative of the city will collect a sample from the discharge point of the grease interceptor. After the sample is collected it will be analyzed for fats, oils, and grease content by a laboratory chosen by the city.
c.
For the variance to be considered, the sample must show a fats, oils, and grease content of less than 100 mg/l. If the sample does show a level below this then a sample will be taken once a week until the sample exceeds the 100 mg/l mark established. Thus, the time elapsed between the last pumping and the time at which the sample exceeds the above mentioned mark will then be the frequency at which that particular trap is pumped.
d.
If at any time the food service facility changes ownership or does any type of renovation the schedule will revert to the original schedule established by the city.
e.
If the initial sample taken from a grease interceptor is not below the 100 gm/l mark then the variance will not be considered.
(7)
Disposal. Wastes removed from each grease interceptor shall be disposed of at a facility permitted by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Chapter of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to receive such wastes or at a location designated by the city for such purposes. Neither grease or solid materials removed from interceptors shall be returned to any grease interceptor, private sewer line or to any of the city wastewater collection system or water reclamation facilities without prior written permission [from the] GMP official.
(8)
Monitoring. The city shall have the right to sample and analyze the wastewater from any food service facility at any time to determine levels of grease contained within a facilities discharge.
(9)
Spill reporting. Any accident, spill, or other discharge of grease of gray water which occurs withing the city shall be reported to the city by the grease hauler as soon as possible but not longer than 24-hours after the incident. The grease hauler shall comply with all procedures contained in federal, state, and local regulations. The grease hauler shall be responsible for all clean up procedures and costs.
(10)
Record keeping. Each facility shall keep records on site of grease trap inspection, cleaning, and maintenance. The records shall remain available for inspection and copying for a period of at least three years and available at all times for city review. Grease haulers shall retain and make available for inspection and copying, all records related to grease interceptor pumping and grease disposal from businesses connected to the city wastewater collection service system. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. The city may require additional record keeping and reporting, as necessary, to ensure compliance with the terms of this section.
(11)
Vehicle inspection. Grease haulers shall permit the city to inspect grease hauler's registered vehicles.
(12)

Sec. 78-121. - Purposes.
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunication providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carrier that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this article shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city;
(2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

(Ord. No. 99-09, § 1, 11-8-99)
Sec. 78-125. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred location sites.
(1)
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the director or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multi-family duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. No. 99-09, § 1, 11-8-99)
Sec. 78-126. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)

Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director.
(2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the director.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
3.
Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 78-127.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers:
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(4)
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
(5)
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height.
(6)
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
(7)
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(8)
All towers, buildings, guy wires and any appurtenances or other devices connected with a tower shall be enclosed by metal security fencing; provided, however, the director may modify the fencing requirement of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
(9)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(Ord. No. 99-09, § 1, 11-8-99)
