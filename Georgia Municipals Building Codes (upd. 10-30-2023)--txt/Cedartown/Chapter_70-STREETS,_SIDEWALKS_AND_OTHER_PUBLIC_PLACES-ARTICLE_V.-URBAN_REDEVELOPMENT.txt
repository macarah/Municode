Sec. 70-125. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "Cedartown Blighted Property Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 3-2014, § 1, 8-11-14)
Sec. 70-126. - Purpose.
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this commission, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced government services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvements thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.
