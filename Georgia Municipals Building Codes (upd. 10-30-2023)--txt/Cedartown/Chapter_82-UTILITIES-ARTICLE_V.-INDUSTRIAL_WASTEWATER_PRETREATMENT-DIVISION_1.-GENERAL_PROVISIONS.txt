DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 82-191. - Purpose and policy.
This article sets forth uniform requirements for users of the wastewater collection and publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1.251 et seq.) and the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this article are:
(a)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW;
(b)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
(c)
To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations;
(d)
To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
(e)
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the POTW;
(f)
To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
(g)
To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject.
This article shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW. The article authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires industrial user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein; requires industrial user compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

The production or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should be considered.
(2)
Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of subsections b. or c. above but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment.

Pretreatment. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater prior to or in lieu of introducing such pollutants into the POTW. This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or biological processes, by process changes, or by other means, except by diluting the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable pretreatment standard.
