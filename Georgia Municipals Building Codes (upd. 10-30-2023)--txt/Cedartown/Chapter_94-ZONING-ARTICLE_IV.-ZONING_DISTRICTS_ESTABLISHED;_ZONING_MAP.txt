Sec. 94-106. - Official zoning map.
The "Official Zoning Map of the City of Cedartown, Georgia," shall be the official title; however, it may be referred to as the "Cedartown Zoning Map." The boundaries of all districts as shown upon the official zoning map are hereby adopted, established and declared to be in effect upon all land included within the boundaries of each district shown upon the official zoning map.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-107. - Rules for determining boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street lines, alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.
(2)
In unsubdivided property or where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless dimensions indicate the same, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the original map. Where a district boundary divides a lot, the zone classification of the greater restriction shall prevail throughout the lot.
(3)
In case any further uncertainty exists, the commission shall interpret the intent of the map as to the location of such boundaries.
(4)
Where any street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of vacation or abandonment.

All land newly annexed to the corporate limits of the city shall be regulated in accordance to the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.) of the state and zoning policies and procedures outlined in herein. The required hearings will be held prior to annexation, and an additional notice of annexation will be published in the local newspaper. For noncommercial annexations, the default zoning classification for newly annexed property shall be either RE-Residential Estate or Planned Development (PD-1, PD-2, PD-3 or PD-4) depending on the size, nature and characteristics of the particular piece of property. Annexed commercial property not meeting the requirements of planned Development (such as lot size) may annex into the city as C-1, C-2 or C-N depending on the best fit and classification of surrounding properties.
