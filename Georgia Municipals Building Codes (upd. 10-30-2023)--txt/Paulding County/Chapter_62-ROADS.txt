However, the following escalation process shall be utilized by the department, its contractor, and the utility to resolve such disputes regarding damages or delays prior to such claims being brought before a court of competent jurisdiction.
"Escalation process step 1 - It shall be the contractor's responsibility to coordinate and track each utilities progress in relation to the work plan or revised work plan previously approved by the Department of Transportation Engineering Division manager or his/her designee. Once the contractor has determined that the utilities work progress is at least 20 percent behind the approved work plan, the contractor will notify the utility and the department of such apparent delay through written correspondence. Such written correspondence shall detail the delay in question and request the utility to submit a proposal on how the utility plans to rectify such delay and maintain the project's schedule prescribed by the previously approved work plan. The utility will respond to this letter within ten business days. The response shall include a proposal to cure the delay identified by the department's contractor. In some cases, the complexity of the project may require that a utility coordination meeting be held to address the issues identified by the department's contractor. If the utility determines that this is the case, then the utility's response letter shall include a request to hold a utility coordination meeting with the department's contractor and the Department of Transportation for utility delay resolution. If the utility delay dispute cannot be resolved through the coordination efforts described above after 20 business days from the date provided in the contractor's original written correspondence, said dispute may be escalated for further consideration as provided in escalation process step 2 below.
"Escalation process step 2 - After the Department of Transportation Engineering Division manager or his/her designee has reviewed and determined that the submitted work plan is unreasonable for the proposed utility work in question, the Department of Transportation Engineering Division manager or his/her designee will notify the utility of such determination through written correspondence. Such written correspondence shall detail the items in question and request the utility to justify or revise the work plan accordingly. The utility will respond to this letter within ten business days. The response shall include justification or proposed revisions to comply with the items in question identified by the Department of Transportation Engineering Division manager or his/her designee. If the work plan dispute cannot be resolved through the efforts described above after 20 business days from the date provided in the Department of Transportation's original written correspondence, said dispute may be escalated by the Department of Transportation Engineering Division manager or his/her designee or the utility to the director of the Department of Transportation and a designated representative of the utility who has authority to settle the dispute and who is at a higher level of management than the person with direct responsibility for the management of the project. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, either party may select relief from such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. The utility shall have a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of the Department of Transportation's original written correspondence to either pay the amount of the damages or delay costs to the department or its contractor or seek relief from this determination by available legal or equitable remedy".

For an example; If a trench is cut diagonal to an east west road, the milling and resurfacing would be measured 50 feet from a point the further west and 50 feet from the point further east for complete milling and resurfacing between those two external points.
For any roadway with no raised barriers separating the lanes, the entire roadway shall be milled and resurfaced as described above. For divided roadways (divided with a raised barrier or median), only the side being trenched needs to be resurfaced.
For any utility trenching within the stop bars or stop lines within a signalized intersection, the entire intersection shall be milled and replaced regardless of the length.
Any and all pavement markings and raised pavement markers within the milled and resurfaced areas shall be replaced in kind according to the department standards for pavement markings and raised pavement markers. Any existing "in-pavement" traffic detection devices within the milled and resurfaced area shall be replaced to the satisfaction of the Department of Transportation traffic operations manager.

The existing asphalt will be saw cut along the edge for the full depth of existing asphalt. A tack coat will be required between the asphalt base course and the asphalt topping overlay coat. The asphalt topping shall match the existing roadway asphalt. When the concrete curbing is cut it shall be replaced from construction joint to construction joint (See trench repair diagram below)."
