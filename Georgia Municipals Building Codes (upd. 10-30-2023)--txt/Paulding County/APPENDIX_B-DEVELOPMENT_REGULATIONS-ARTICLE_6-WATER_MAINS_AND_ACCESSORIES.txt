Prior to replacing pavement, make a final cut in the pavement 12 inches back from the edge of the previous cut line. Make the cut using a rotary saw. Remove pavement and base material to a depth of ten inches below finished grade. Construct an eight-inch thick concrete (3,000 psi) bridge the full width of the pavement cut (ie... trench width plus 24 inches). Apply tack coat and two inches of type F asphalt when concrete has cured.
(e)
Replace all street roadway pavement, driveways, sidewalks, and curbs with the same material and to the same dimensions as existing.
(f)
Should any pavement restoration or repairs fail or settle during the life of the contract, including the bonded period, promptly restore or repair defects.
3)
Concrete pavement removal and replacement shall conform to the applicable sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges, latest edition.
6.5.8 Railroad crossings. Railroad crossings shall be made in accordance with all requirements of the affected railroad. It will be the contractor's responsibility to obtain all requirements from the railroads and furnish all labor and materials required to fulfill such requirements. The contractor shall furnish and install the casing under the tracks with whatever material and with whatever methods and under whatever regulations are required by the railroads.
6.5.9 Stream and ditch crossing.
1)
At all points where banks of streams or drainage ditches are disturbed by excavation or where natural vegetation is removed, carefully compact backfill and place rip rap to prevent subsequent settlement and erosion.
2)
Place rip rap a distance of not less than ten feet upstream and downstream or ten feet each side of the stream in any disturbed area. Extend rip rap from one foot below stream bed to top of bank. Place to conform with the natural slope of the stream bank.
3)
The requirements of this section apply equally to construction along side a stream or drainage ditch as well as crossing a stream or drainage ditch.
4)
Embed stone rip rap by hand so as to form a compact layer at least 12 inches thick. Place rip rap in such a way that the smaller stones are not segregated but evenly distributed. Place stones in the crevices between the larger stones so that a dense, well-graded mass is produced.
6.5.10 Cleaning and maintenance.
1)
The contractor shall remove all surplus material, tools, and temporary structures. The site of construction shall be left clean, to the satisfaction of the department.
2)
After the work is accepted as a whole, the contractor shall maintain the surface of the unpaved trenches, adjacent curbs, sidewalks, gutters, shoulders, street paving, shrubbery, fences, sod, grass and other disturbed surfaces for a period of 90 days thereafter.
3)

This work shall include in general but without limitation, the spreading of topsoil, seeding, fertilizing and mulching required to restore disturbed areas as necessary for the proper completion of the work as may be required, directed or as specified herein. On all "sod" type lawns and other improved, well-established grass areas, the sod/grass shall be carefully removed, kept alive and replaced after the backfilling is finished. The contractor shall also remove all spoil from such areas as quickly as possible after the excavation is backfilled, and he shall leave the premises in as good of condition as before undertaking the work. It is the intent of these regulations to place seed over all disturbed areas, to place topsoil and seed where established lawn areas existed prior to construction, and to provide for sod removal/replacement.
3)
The requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges," latest edition, shall apply insofar as they are applicable.
4)
When directed, areas to be seeded shall be covered with a layer of topsoil where topsoil has been disturbed by the pipe laying operation. The topsoil shall be of sufficient thickness that when spread and compacted, a minimum of four inches will be available. Furnish natural topsoil of a good condition and tillable structure. Obtain topsoil as borrow from an outside source and from piles of uniform texture, drainage, and other characteristics so as to constitute a homogeneous mixture approved by the department. No existing materials may be re-used in this work unless approved. Furnish topsoil free from objectionable materials such as hard clods, stiff clay, sods, hardpan, partially disintegrated stone, or other materials that are not integrally a natural component of good agricultural soils and which are harmful to or unnecessary for successful plant growth.
