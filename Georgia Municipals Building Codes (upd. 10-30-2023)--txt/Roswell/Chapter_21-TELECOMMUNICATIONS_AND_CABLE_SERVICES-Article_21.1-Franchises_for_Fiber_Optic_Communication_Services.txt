Control or controlling interest means actual working control in whatever manner exercised, including, without limitation, working control through ownership, management, debt instruments or negative control, as the case may be, of the grantee or the telecommunications system. A rebuttable presumption of the existence of control or a controlling interest shall arise from the beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, by any person, or group of persons acting in concert, of more than twenty (20) percent of any person (which person or group of persons is hereinafter referred to as "controlling person"). "Control" or "controlling interest" as used herein may be held simultaneously by more than one (1) person or group of persons.

Revenue derived from private line services provided by the grantee shall be prorated by dividing the portion of the private line located in the streets and public rights-of-way by the total mileage of the private line. Gross revenue shall not include the wholesale revenue of the grantee to the extent that the person providing such wholesale revenue to the grantee pays to the city, pursuant to an agreement with the city, an annual franchise fee, or an amount equivalent thereto, calculated on the basis of such person's gross revenue (as defined in this agreement) from the provision of services in the city. By way of example, but without limitation "gross revenue" includes installation charges, access charges paid to the grantee by other carriers, and the lease or resale of lines or circuit paths to third parties. "Gross revenue" does not include revenue uncollectible from customers or revenue from long distance services.

Public right-of-way also includes the surface of any public street, alley, path, bridge, tunnel, sidewalk, planting strip, median, waterway, dock, wharf, pier, public ground or other public right-of-way acquired by the city. No reference herein or in any franchise for use of any public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its title to any public right-of-way or any improvement or object located therein is sufficient to permit or authorize its use by the grantee.
Services means any telephone service, interconnection service, access service and other telecommunications services provided by the grantee in connection with the telecommunications system, except for "cable service," as that term is defined at 47 U.S.C. 522(6).
System or telecommunications system means grantee's network of cables, wires, lines, towers, wave guides, optic fiber, microwave, and any associated converters, equipment, or facilities designed and constructed for the purpose of producing, receiving, amplifying or distributing audio, video or other forms of electronic signals to or from subscribers or locations within the city, but not including the offering to the public cable television services as defined under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, and/or any franchise granted by the city pursuant to said act.

(a)
Any franchise application shall be accompanied by a processing fee in the amount of $1,000.00. In addition to the processing fee, each applicant shall be responsible for reasonable direct costs incurred by the city in overseeing the use of its right-of-way. Such fee and associated costs are in addition to fees associated with any licenses or permits required to be furnished by federal, state, or local law. The costs for which grantee may be responsible include but are not limited to:
(1)

The grantee shall have the sole responsibility for diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses, or other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, operate, maintain or repair the system, and to construct, maintain and repair any part thereof prior to commencement of any such activity. Issuance of a permit by any agency of the city as to the construction and installation of any portion of grantee's system does not waive other applicable requirements of federal or Georgia law, and grantee shall comply with such other requirements.
(b)
Subject to police power. The construction, expansion, reconstruction, excavation, use, maintenance and operation of the system shall be subject to all lawful police regulations of the city and performed in accordance with all laws and regulations of the city for utility location and excavation in public rights-of-way presently in effect or hereafter adopted.

All work shall be subject to inspection by the city.
Section 21.1.6 - As Built Drawings.
Grantee shall submit to the director of transportation "as built" drawings of the portions of grantee's system located along the public right-of-way of a size and material satisfactory to the director of transportation within one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of construction of such portions.

Such installation must be set at and maintained at the location and depth specified in grantee's permit.
(b)
In areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation, grantee may install its service above ground; provided, that at such time as those facilities are required to be placed underground by the city, or are placed underground, grantee shall likewise place its services underground without additional cost to the city.
(c)
Grantee shall at all times comply fully with provisions of the state minimum building codes as adopted by the City of Roswell.
(d)
Interference with persons, improvements, public and private property and utilities. Grantee's system and facilities, including poles, lines, equipment and all appurtenances, shall be located, erected and maintained so that such facilities shall:

In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair or removal of the system, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures and improvements, including landscaping and trees belonging to the city, and all designated historical landmarks, as well as all other structures within any designated historical district. The grantee shall obtain the prior approval of the city before altering or crossing any water main, sewerage or drainage system, or any other municipal, state or federally owned structure in the streets required because of the presence of the system in the streets. Any such alteration shall be made by the grantee at its sole cost and expense, and in a manner prescribed by the city. The grantee shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and restore to serviceable condition in a manner as may be specified by the city, any street or any municipal, state or federally owned structure involved in the construction of the system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the grantee pursuant to its franchise.
(f)
Erection, removal and use of poles. No poles shall be erected by grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, types and any other pertinent aspect. Such pole or structures shall be removed or modified by grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. Approval under this section shall require the written approval of the department of transportation.
(g)
Upon request of the city or other authority of competent jurisdiction, grantee shall remove and abate any portion of the system or any facility that is dangerous to life or property, and in case grantee, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the same, at the sole cost and expense of grantee, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee.
Section 21.1.8 - Suspension or Revocation of Construction Permit.
The director of transportation may suspend or revoke any permit issued by the department of transportation or take any action he deems necessary, including the stopping of work, should grantee materially violate the terms of said permit, until said violation has been corrected to said director's satisfaction.
Section 21.1.9 - Adjustment of Utility Facilities.
In the event that the location of grantee's system will require an adjustment of the installation of existing public or private utility facilities, grantee must obtain written consent of the owner of such utility, including, where applicable, all relevant city departments to such adjustment and make such arrangements for the payment or reimbursement of the cost of such adjustment as are satisfactory to the owner of such utility, including, where applicable, all relevant city departments. No permit for construction will be issued until the director of the department of transportation is satisfied that the requirements of this section have been satisfied. In no case shall grantee be entitled to perform such adjustment or disturb such utility facilities without the written consent of the owner of such utility.
Section 21.1.10 - Adjoining Property Owners.
All of grantee's system shall be so installed and located so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and appearance and reasonable convenience of adjoining property owners and at all times shall be kept and maintained in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and repair.

Section 21.1.12 - Moving Wires.
If determined to be necessary to promote the public health, welfare and safety, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, the city may, in its reasonable discretion, take such action with respect to grantee's system in the streets or in city government buildings as it deems necessary to promote the public health, welfare and safety, in which event the city shall not be liable therefor to the grantee. The city shall notify grantee of the necessity for such action with respect to grantee's system as soon as practicable.
Section 21.1.13 - Temporary Removal of Facilities for Demolition of Buildings.
Upon the request of a person holding a permit issued by the city for the moving or demolition of a building, and at least ten (10) days' notice, grantee shall temporarily raise, lower or remove its facilities to permit the removal or demolition of such building. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same and grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance provided, however, that no payment (direct or indirect) shall be required of the city.
Section 21.1.14 - Joint Use; Occupancy of City Owned Conduit.
Every public utility and every grantee may be required by the city to permit joint use of its property and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys, and public places of the city by other public utilities and grantees, in so far as such joint use may be reasonably practicable or necessitated by space limitations in the right-of-way. Such joint use shall be in accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code and conditioned upon payment of reasonable rental therefor based upon market rates, including without limitation a reasonable pro rata share of construction costs; provided, that in the absence of agreement, upon application by any public utility or grantee, the council shall provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint use and the compensation to be paid therefor, which award shall be final. Grantee may require any such person or entity to furnish evidence of adequate insurance covering grantee and adequate bonds covering the performance of the person or entity attaching to grantee's facilities as a condition precedent to granting permission to any such person or entity to attach wires or equipment to grantee's facilities provided, that grantee's requirements for such insurance shall be reasonable.
If the city owns or leases conduit in the path of grantee's proposed telecommunications facilities, and provided it is technologically feasible for grantee to occupy the conduit owned or leased by the city, grantee shall be required to occupy the conduit owned or leased by the city in order to reduce the necessity to excavate the rights-of-way. Grantee shall pay to the city a fee for such occupancy which shall be the cost grantee would have expended to construct its own conduit from the outset, as certified by the grantee's engineer and approved by the city's department of transportation. The city and grantee may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments to the city over the term of the franchise, including the time value of money.
Section 21.1.15 - Removal of City Property.
No property of the city is to be removed from the right-of-way, including signage on utility poles, without prior approval from the city.
Section 21.1.16 - Reservation of Rights.
The city reserves the right to exercise its police and/or proprietary powers to modify, vacate or transfer any right-of-way in use by grantee for a public purpose. At grantee's own risk the city has the predominant right to use its right-of-way in the placement, maintenance and repair of sewers, water mains and other public utilities or to relocate or remove grantee's system where the city determines that the public convenience and/or necessity would be enhanced or for any other public purpose, including, but not limited to the use of any right-of-way used by grantee for public transportation purposes or where the director of transportation determines there is an emergency. The permits referred to in section 21.1.8 may be amended or revoked in whole or in part by the issuing department whenever such action is necessary or advisable for a public purpose. Grantee shall make no claims for costs or damages against the city by reason of such removal or relocation. Within thirty (30) days' written notice to grantee of partial or complete revocation of such permit from the director of transportation, grantee shall start to remove, modify, replace or relocate its facilities as required at its own expense. In the event grantee does not complete the removal, modification, replacement or relocation of its facilities as required by said notice within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice, or within such extended period as the director of transportation may grant, the director of transportation may cause the same to be done at grantee's expense and all expenses incurred or damages paid by the city on account of such action shall be paid by grantee on demand. Grantee shall remove, replace or modify, at its own expense, the installation of any of its facilities as may be deemed necessary by any other appropriate governmental authority to meet such authority's proper responsibilities. In the event the city exercises its predominant right to use any right-of-way used by grantee for a public purpose, the city shall reasonably cooperate with grantee in finding an alternate site for any telecommunications facilities removed and in avoiding disruption to grantee's telecommunications system to the extent not reasonably required by the city. In an emergency, as determined by the director of transportation, the city may order grantee to remove or relocate its facilities within forty-eight (48) hours. If the city exercises any of its rights pursuant to this section, grantee shall have the option, upon notice to the city administrator of abandoning the portion of its telecommunications system to be so removed or relocated and deleting such portion from the public right-of-way.
Section 21.1.17 - Reserved.
Section 21.1.18 - Protection of Trees.
Trimming of trees and shrubbery within the public right-of-way to prevent contact with grantee's facilities shall be done only in accordance with the standards approved by the city arborist in accordance with the ordinances of the city. Grantee shall comply in all respects with design guidelines. Removal or pruning of any tree or shrub or such tree or shrub's roots shall only be done upon issuance of a permit by the arborist. When trees or shrubs in the public right-of-way are damaged as a result of work undertaken by or on behalf of grantee, grantee shall pay the city within thirty (30) days of submission of a statement by the city, the cost of any treatment required to preserve the tree or shrub and/or cost for removal and replacement of the tree or shrub with landscaping of equal value and/or the value of the tree or shrub prior to the damage or removal, as determined by the arborist or other authorized agent of the city.
Any damage to trees or shrubs which is the result of neglect or the failure to act in accordance with plans approved by the arborist shall be deemed a violation of this article and punished as provided in section 1.1.3 of this Code.
(Ord. No. 2014-02-03, § 1, Amended 2/24/2014)
Section 21.1.19 - Abandonment of Right-of-Way.
Nothing in this agreement waives or releases the rights of the city in and to the streets. If all or part of the streets are eliminated, discontinued, closed or demapped, the franchise shall cease with respect to such streets upon the effective date of the final action of the city in connection therewith. If the elimination, discontinuance, closing or demapping of all or part of the streets is undertaken for the benefit of any private person, the city shall make reasonable efforts to condition its consent to the elimination, discontinuance, closing or demapping on the agreement of the private person on (i) granting the grantee the right to continue to occupy and use the streets or (ii) reimbursing the grantee for the reasonable costs of relocating the affected equipment.
Section 21.1.20 - Rights of Abutting Landowners.
In the event that the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or right-of-way, such grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights herein granted to grantee.
Section 21.1.21 - Relocation of the System.
(a)
New grades or lines. If the grades or lines of any street on which grantee's system is placed are changed at any time during the term of the franchise, then the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city, protect or promptly alter or relocate the system, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event that the grantee refuses or neglects to so protect alter or relocate all or part of the system, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate such part of the system, without any liability to the city, and the grantee shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation.
(b)
Relocation of right-of-way. Wherever a public right-of-way or other public property is being constructed, paved (whether or not such paving is part of a more extensive improvement project), resurfaced, relocated or otherwise altered or improved (including, but not limited to: the installation of sidewalk, curb, gutter, drainage facilities, water mains, or sewer mains, traffic signals or trees) grantee shall, within ninety (90) days of written notice from the director of transportation, and at no cost (direct or indirect) to the city, remove or relocate any grantee facility located within such public right-of-way or public property or perform such work as it deems necessary for the extension of new facilities. In the event the grantee fails to relocate its equipment in a manner approved by the city within ninety (90) days of the city's written notice, absent an extension of time granted by the city, the city may seek revocation of the franchise agreement pursuant to section 21.1.33 of this article. Failure to obtain the city's approval of the location of facilities relocated under this section will be considered a forfeiture under section 21.1.33 of this article. Grantee shall be responsible for any damage it causes to property, including damage to trees and other landscaping, as a result of the relocation or removal of facilities.
(c)
Time limit—Liquidated damages. Failure of grantee to remove or relocate the facility to a location approved by the city within ninety (90) days of the city's written notice shall entitle the city to recover liquidated damages from grantee. The liquidated damages for failure to remove or relocate a facility shall be $250.00 per diem. If grantee believes it will be unable to complete the relocation within ninety (90) days from receipt of notice from the city, grantee shall explain the reasons for its inability in detail and the city and grantee shall attempt to agree on an alternate schedule, subject, to the city's right to finally determine the schedule and liquidated damages, as long as its decision is not unreasonable.
Section 21.1.22 - Bonds.
(a)
Grantee shall obtain and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and file with the city administrator, a corporate surety bond with a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia and found acceptable by the city attorney both to guarantee the timely construction and full activation of grantee's system, and to secure grantee's performance of its obligations and faithful adherence to all requirements of the ordinance codified in this article. Grantee shall provide this corporate surety bond at the time of execution of a franchise agreement, as required by section 21.1.4 of this article. The franchise agreement shall specify the amount of such bond, conditions for withdrawal, and such other provisions as may be required to insure grantee's faithful performance of its obligations.
(b)
The rights reserved to the city with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by the ordinance codified in this chapter or authorized by law; and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such bond shall affect any other right the city may have.
Section 21.1.23 - Insurance Requirements.
(a)
On or before the effective date of the franchise, grantee shall file with the city a certificate of insurance and thereafter maintain in full force and effect at all times for the full term of the franchise, at the expense of grantee, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy, including underground property damage coverage, naming the city as additional insured, written by a company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, protecting the city against liability for loss or bodily injury and property damage occasioned by the installation, removal, maintenance, or operation of the communications system by grantee. The limits of such policy shall be specified in the franchise agreement.
(b)
Grantee shall also file with the city a certificate of insurance for a comprehensive automobile liability insurance policy written by a company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, for allowed, non-owned, hired and leased vehicles operated by grantee, with limits no less than $1,000,000.00 each accident, single limit, bodily injury and property damage combined, or evidence of self-insurance.
(c)
Grantee shall also maintain, and by its acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder, and specifically agrees that it will maintain throughout the term of the franchise, workers compensation and employers liability, valid in the state, in the minimum amount of the statutory limit for workers compensation, and $500,000.00 for employers liability.
(d)
All liability insurance required pursuant to this section shall be kept in full force and effect by grantee during the existence of the franchise and until after the removal of all poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and any other conductors and fixtures installed by grantee incident to the maintenance and operation of the communications system as defined in this chapter. All policies shall be endorsed to give the city thirty (30) days' written notice of the intent to amend or cancel by either grantee or the insuring company.
Section 21.1.24 - Indemnification.
The grantee and each affiliated person shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants and independent contractors from and against all liabilities, whether special, incidental, consequential or punitive, and all other damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with the award of this franchise, the installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of equipment or the provision of services through the equipment. The grantee and each affiliated person also shall cooperate with the city by providing such nonfinancial assistance as may be requested by the city in connection with any claim arising out of or in connection with the selection of franchisees for, or the negotiation or award of, this agreement.
Section 21.1.25 - Services to the City.
Grantee shall cooperate with the city to see that the city's own telecommunications and data transfer needs are met. In addition, grantee shall maintain with the city a current listing of all buildings, both public and private, in which it provides services. No monthly fee shall be charged to the city for this service.
Section 21.1.26 - Compensation to the City.
(a)
Franchise Fee. For the reason that the public streets, alleys and rights-of-way to be used by grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the city are valuable, public properties, acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to grantee of the use of said public streets, alleys and rights-of-way is a valuable property right, without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the city as a franchise fee a percentage of its gross revenue and/or a charge for each linear foot of fiber laid within the City of Roswell. Such percentage or charge, as well as an annual minimum fee, shall be specified in each franchise agreement required to be adopted by this article. The grantee's obligation to pay the franchise fee including the annual minimum fee shall commence on the effective date of the franchise agreement and continue throughout the term.
(b)
Franchise Fee Report. All such payment of franchise fees shall be accompanied by a report to the city.
(c)
Franchise Modification or Renewal Costs. The grantee shall pay at such time and in such manner as the city shall specify to the city or, at the direction of the city, to third parties an amount equal to the reasonable costs the city incurs for the services of third parties (including but not limited to attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal, renegotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of this agreement or the franchise.
(d)
No Credits or Deductions. The compensation and other payments to be made pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a tax, and shall be in addition to any and all taxes or other fees or charges that the grantee shall be required to pay to the city or to any state or federal agency or authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee.
(e)
Interest on Late Payments. If any payment required by this agreement is not actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in this agreement, the grantee shall pay interest thereon, from the due date to the date paid at a rate equal to one (1) percent per month compounded monthly.
(f)
Acceptance of Compensation. No acceptance of any compensation payment by the city shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim that the city may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the city.
(g)
Remedy for Underpayment. If, as a result of an audit or any other review, the city determines that the grantee has underpaid fees in any twelve-month period by ten (10) percent or more, then, in addition to making full payment of the relevant obligation, including interest as described in subsection (e), the grantee shall reimburse the city for all of the reasonable costs associated with the audit or review, including all reasonable out-of-pocket costs for attorneys, accountants and other consultants.
(h)
Ordinary Business Expense. Nothing in this agreement is intended to prevent the grantee from treating the compensation and other payments that it pays pursuant to this agreement as an ordinary expense of doing business and, accordingly, from deducting said payments from gross income in any federal, state or local income tax return.
Section 21.1.27 - Accounts, Records and Reports.
(a)
Grantee shall keep the city fully informed as to all matters in connection with or affecting the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of grantee's system, grantee's accounting methods and procedures in connection therewith, and the recording and reporting by grantee of all revenues and uncollectibles.
(b)
Grantee shall keep complete and accurate books of account and records of its business and operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, subject to approval by the city. If required by the FCC, grantee shall use the system of accounts and the forms of books, accounts, records, and memoranda prescribed by the FCC in 47 CFR Part 32 or its successor and as may be further described herein. The city may require the keeping of additional records or accounts which are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting gross revenues and uncollectibles for purposes of section 21.1.26 of this article. Grantee shall keep its books of account and records in such a way that breakdowns of revenues are available by type of service within the city.
(c)
Grantee shall file annually with the director of finance and the city administrator, on a form approved by the city, no later than ninety (90) days after the end of the grantee's fiscal year, an audited statement of revenues (for that year) attributable to the operations of the grantee's system within. This statement shall present a detailed breakdown of gross revenues and uncollectible accounts for the year. This statement shall be audited by an independent certified public accountant whose report shall accompany the statement. The city may, if it sees fit, have the books and records of grantee examined by a representative of said city to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein.
(d)
Grantee shall report to the city such other information relating to grantee as the city may consider useful and shall comply with the city's determination of forms for reports, the time for reports, the frequency with which any reports are to be made, and if reports are to be made under oath.
(e)
Grantee shall provide the city with access at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes, to examine, audit and review the papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other records of grantee pertaining to the franchise ordinance codified in this chapter. Grantee shall fully cooperate in making available its records and otherwise assisting in these activities.
(f)
The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to grantee's operation of its system within the City of Roswell and Fulton County. Grantee shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis.
Section 21.1.28 - Dispute Resolution.
If grantee shall in good faith maintain that the amount, terms or nature of any adjustment to compensation proposed by the city pursuant to section 21.1.26 is excessive or unreasonable, given the value of the privileges granted under this article and grantee's franchise, grantee shall enter into good faith negotiations with the city as expeditiously as possible to reach an agreement as to the adjustment to compensation. In the event that an agreement as to adjustment to compensation is not reached, grantee shall have the right to make a demand for arbitration in writing to the city administrator. In such event, the city and grantee shall each appoint an arbitrator and a third arbitrator shall be appointed by the arbitrators so appointed. Each arbitrator shall have at least five (5) years of experience in the field of rights-of-way procurement. Pursuant to the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association, or any successor organization, an arbitration shall be held as expeditiously as possible.
Section 21.1.29 - Extension of Term; Continuing Obligation and Holdover.
If the grantee continues to use the telecommunications system to provide services after the term, then the grantee shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this agreement, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions of this agreement, throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of this agreement or the franchise, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. If this agreement terminates for any reason whatsoever and the grantee fails to cease using telecommunications system to provide service, the city, in addition to all other remedies available to it under this agreement or by law, shall be entitled to receive all payments it is entitled to receive under this agreement including, but not limited to, the compensation set forth in subsection 21.1.26(a).
Section 21.1.30 - Renewal.
The grantee may submit a written petition to the city to renew the franchise not later than six (6) months nor more than twelve (12) months before the end of the term. Any proposed renewal, extension or modification of the franchise is subject to the council's approval, modification or rejection and conditioned upon grantee's continuing compliance with this ordinance and others respecting use of the public right-of-way.
Section 21.1.31 - Assignment or Transfer of Franchise.
Neither the franchise, the assets held by grantee under the franchise, nor any rights or obligations of the grantee in the equipment or pursuant to this agreement, nor any guaranty of the performance of the grantee's obligations pursuant to this agreement, nor any part of the capacity of the equipment, either separately or collectively, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by grantee to any other person, firm, corporation, affiliate or entity, without the written consent of the city by mayor and council, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld. The prior written consent of the city shall not be required with respect to the purchase of services in connection with the telecommunications system, or the purchase of capacity of the telecommunication system or the equipment at wholesale rates for the purpose of resale at the retail level unless such purchase involves all or substantially all the services or capacity of the telecommunications system or the equipment or is otherwise intended to evade the consent requirements of this article. Any such transfer or assignment may be subject to additional conditions as specified in the franchise agreement.
Section 21.1.32 - Violations; Breach Procedures.
Upon evidence being received by the city that any violation of the franchise ordinance, any City of Roswell Charter provisions or any ordinances lawfully regulating grantee in the construction and operation of this system is occurring, or has occurred the city shall cause an investigation to be made. The city shall notify the grantee, in writing, of an alleged breach, which notice shall specify the alleged breach with reasonable particularity. The grantee shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice or such longer period of time as the city may specify in such notice, either cure such alleged breach or, in a written response to the city, either present facts and arguments in refutation or excuse of such alleged breach or state that such alleged breach will be cured and set forth the method and time schedule for accomplishing such cure.
If the city determines that a breach has occurred and that such breach is not excusable and has not been or will not be cured by the grantee in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the city, then the city shall prepare a written report which may recommend the action to be taken by the city's governing body. The city shall provide notice and a copy of such report to the grantee. In the event that the city's governing body determines that such breach has not occurred, or that such breach either has been or will be cured in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the city's governing body, or that such breach is excusable, such determination shall conclude the investigation.
If the city's governing body determines that such breach has occurred, and that such breach has not been and will not be cured in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the city's governing body, and that such breach is not excusable, then the city may take any action authorized by law, including revocation or repeal of the franchise or a suit in court to compel compliance. If, in any such proceeding default is finally established, grantee shall be required to pay to the city the reasonable expenses incurred in the prosecution of such suit and all the city's damages and costs (including attorney's fees).
Section 21.1.33 - Revocation and Termination.
(a)
In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city under any franchise or otherwise, the city reserves the right to revoke and terminate any franchise issued by authority of the ordinance codified in this article, and all rights and privileges of grantee hereunder shall cease in the event of material breach, subject to reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, of its terms and conditions. A material breach of grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(1)
Grantee's violation of any material provision of the franchise ordinance codified in this article or any material rule, order or regulation of the city made pursuant to the franchise ordinance codified in this article;
(2)
Grantee's failure to properly compensate the city as required in the franchise ordinance codified in this article;
(3)
Grantee's attempt to evade any material provision of the franchise ordinance codified in this article or to practice any fraud or deceit upon the city or upon grantee's end-user customers or inter-exchange carriers;
(4)
Grantee's failure to comply with section 21.1.5 of this chapter;
(5)
For failure to file and maintain the bond, security or insurance required under this chapter;
(6)
Grantee's failure to comply with section 21.1.26 of this chapter;
(7)
Grantee's failure to respond to or comply with reports, audits, statements and other information lawfully requested by the city;
(8)
Grantee's failure to operate its system for six (6) months after it has been constructed; or
(9)
Grantee's material misrepresentation of fact in its application or negotiations during the franchise process; or the conviction of any director, officer, employee or agent of grantee for the offense of bribery or fraud connected with or resulting from the award of the franchise to grantee.
(b)
The foregoing shall not constitute a material breach if the violation occurs without the fault of grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. Grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship, nor misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees. Revocation or termination shall only take place for material cause.
(c)
If any provision of this chapter shall be preempted by state or federal regulations, or finally adjudged by a court of law invalid or unenforceable and the council further finds that such provision constitutes at that time a consideration material to the continuance of the franchise herein granted, the city reserves the right to revoke and terminate any franchise issued under authority of this chapter.
