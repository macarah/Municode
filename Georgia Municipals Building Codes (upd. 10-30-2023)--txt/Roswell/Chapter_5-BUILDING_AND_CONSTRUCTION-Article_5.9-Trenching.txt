Section 5.9.1 - Definitions.
Excavation means any manmade cavity or depression in the earth's surface, including its sides, walls, or faces, formed by earth removal and producing unsupported earth conditions as results of the excavation. If installed forms or similar structures reduce the depth to width relationship, an excavation may become a trench.
OSHA means the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or successor agency.
Supervisory personnel means any person who has the responsibility for layout, oversight, superintending, directing or controlling an excavation or trench.
Trench is a narrow excavation made below the surface of the ground. In general, the depth is greater than the width, but the width of the trench is not greater than fifteen (15) feet.
