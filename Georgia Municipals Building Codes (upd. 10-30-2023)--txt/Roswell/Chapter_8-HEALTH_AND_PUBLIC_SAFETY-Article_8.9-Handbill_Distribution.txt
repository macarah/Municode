Article 8.9 - Handbill Distribution

Section 8.9.1 - Purpose.
Insofar as unsolicited handbills and flyers are constantly left on private premises and vehicles in public places, there is a problem with litter as such handbills are oftentimes blown into the streets and onto lawns and not retrieved. In addition to the litter problem created by handbill distribution, an accumulation of handbills is a signal to burglars or vandals that the residence is unoccupied. To that end, this article will set out guidelines for distribution of unsolicited handbills.
