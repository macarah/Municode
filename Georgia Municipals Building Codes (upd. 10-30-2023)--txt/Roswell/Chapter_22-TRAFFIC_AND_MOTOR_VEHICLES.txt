The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device provided for under O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18 shall maintain a log for the automated traffic enforcement safety device attesting to the performance of such device's self-test at least once every thirty (30) days and the results of such self-test pertaining to the accuracy of the automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such log shall be admissible in any civil enforcement proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18. The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device shall perform an independent calibration test on the automated traffic enforcement safety device at least once every twelve (12) months. The results of such calibration test shall be admissible in any court proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18.
(b)
Prior to the placement of a device within a school zone, each school within whose school zone such automated traffic enforcement safety device is to be placed shall first apply for and secure a permit from the department of transportation for the use of such automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such permit shall be awarded based upon need. The department of transportation shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of this paragraph.
(c)
If an automated traffic enforcement safety device is moved to or placed in a location where an automated traffic enforcement safety device had not previously been moved to or placed in, no citation shall be issued for a violation recorded by that automated traffic enforcement safety device until:
(1)
The city shall erect signs warning of the use of a stationary speed detection device within the approaching school zone. Such signs shall be at least twenty-four (24) by thirty (30) inches in area, shall be visible plainly from every lane of traffic, shall be viewable in all traffic conditions, and shall not be placed in such a manner that the view of such sign is subject to being obstructed by any other vehicle on such highway. Such signs shall be placed within five hundred (500) feet prior to the warning sign announcing the reduction of the speed limit for the school speed zone. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such signs are properly installed pursuant to this subsection at the time of any alleged violation under this article; and
(2)
That no citation shall be issued for the first thirty (30) days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by a law enforcement agency within a school zone, but rather, a civil warning shall be issued for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
(d)
A law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of a school zone, or an agent working on behalf of a law enforcement agency or governing body, shall send by first class mail addressed to the owner of the motor vehicle within thirty (30) days after obtaining the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle but no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the alleged violation:
(1)
A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the violation, the location of the infraction, the maximum speed at which such motor vehicle was traveling in photographically recorded images, the maximum speed applicable within such school zone, the civil warning or the amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed, and the date by which a civil monetary penalty shall be paid;
(2)
An image taken from the photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction;
(3)
A website address where photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction and a duplicate of the information provided for in this paragraph may be viewed;
(4)
A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of the school zone and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law;
(5)
A statement of the inference provided by Georgia law and of the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted for such violations;
(6)
Information advising the owner of the motor vehicle of the manner in which liability as alleged in the citation may be contested through an administrative hearing; and
(7)
A warning that the failure to pay the civil monetary penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner as provided for in subsection (d) of this Code section shall waive any right to contest liability.
(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images. A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
(f)
Liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this Code section was operated in violation of the speed limit of the school zone, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized statement that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or
(2)
Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(g)
A violation for which a civil warning or a civil monetary penalty is imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall not be considered a moving traffic violation for the purpose of points assessment under O.C.G.A. § 40-5-57. Such violation shall be deemed noncriminal, and imposition of a civil warning or civil monetary penalty pursuant to this ordinance shall not be deemed a conviction and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it be used for any insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
(h)
Any court having jurisdiction over violations of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18(a) shall have jurisdiction over cases arising under this ordinance and shall be authorized to impose the civil monetary penalty provided for by this subsection. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Georgia law, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure, defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise applicable to violations under this ordinance shall apply to enforcement under this ordinance; provided however, that any appeal from superior or state court shall be by application in the same manner as that provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-6-35.
