a.
Employed as an ingredient (including use as an intermediate) in a process to make a product (for example, utilizing old newspaper to make new paper products); or

d.
A material is not "used, reused or recycled" when it is applied to or placed on or in the land in a manner that constitutes disposal which may pose a threat to human health and the environment (for example, utilizing solids containing levels of hazardous constituents (as listed in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 40 Appendix VIII, Part 261 & Chapter 391-3-11 of the Georgia Rules for Solid Waste Management) for fill material when those levels are greater than the background levels in the area to be filled, land applying sludge in excess of generally accepted agricultural practices or use in inherently waste-like materials as fill material) (as defined in section 391-3-4-.07 of the Georgia Rules for Solid Waste Management).

ARTICLE IV. - PUBLIC NUISANCES

Sec. 11-30. - Purpose and intent.
It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisance, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring.
It is therefore the purpose and intent of this chapter to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe or devaluating conditions. To this end, this chapter seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.
