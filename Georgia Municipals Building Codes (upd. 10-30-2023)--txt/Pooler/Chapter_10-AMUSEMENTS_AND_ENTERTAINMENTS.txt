Whereas, the duly elected governing authority of the City of Pooler finds, determines and declares as follows:

That, after a thorough period of research and public involvement, the following standards have been developed in order to simplify the permitting process for alcohol sales in conjunction with providing live entertainment, while maintaining those regulations necessary to provide for public health, safety and welfare.
The proposed revisions will add operational standards, such as zoning requirements and operational standards and require an annual entertainment permit. The entertainment permit would require the permitting of any venue having live entertainment.
Therefore, the changes will require all alcohol-serving establishments having entertainment within the city to obtain an entertainment permit. The changes will create a consistent set of regulations for all entertainment venues within the city.
