This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety.

Adoption of this article is not to be relied upon as a determination by the City of Pooler that operation of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.

Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any State of Georgia law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on the roads of the City of Pooler.

It is declared that derelict motor vehicles, when left unattended on a public street, road or highway, or other public or private real property within the corporate limits of the city, for a period of not less than ten days on public property or 30 days on private property, constitute a health hazard or unsightly nuisance in that they provide a place for insects, rodents and other animals to exist, attract children, vagrants and other individuals and may cause injury to them and obstruct the streets and ways on and in which they may be found. It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide for the removal and disposal of such derelict motor vehicles and the procedures pertaining thereto.
(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § I)
Sec. 82-72. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Derelict motor vehicle means a motor vehicle which is not an abandoned vehicle and/or any part thereof as defined in O.C.G.A. § 40-11-1(1)(A) which is incapable of being moved under its own power and has had one or more of the major parts for its safe operation removed or destroyed, and has no value other than nominal salvage value, provided, that this definition shall not apply to any motor vehicle or part thereof which shall be located within the premises of any junkyard complying with the laws of the state relating to the licensing and regulating of motor vehicle junkyards. Whenever the word "vehicle" is used in this article, it shall refer to a derelict motor vehicle as defined in this section.
Owner means any person, firm, corporation or other entity which is named as owning a derelict motor vehicle and/or having any security interest therein, or lienholder, or other interest as reflected according to any certificate of title for such vehicle issued by any department or agency of a state having authority to issue such certificate, provided, that if no such certificate has been issued by a state or if none is available, nor can be obtained, the information indicating ownership as provided on the vehicle license registration shall be sufficient, and provided, that if with reasonable diligence the information contained on the title certificate and the vehicle license registration cannot be obtained, the owner of a vehicle shall be considered unknown.
Public property means any real property owned, operated, in the possession of or controlled by any federal, state, county, municipal governmental entity or authority created by any such entity, and any street, alley, sidewalk or other right-of-way used, owned or dedicated to public use, or any shopping center parking lot open to and used by the general public.

(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § II)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 82-73. - Duties of city employees.
(a)
The city manager is authorized to designate such city employees as are necessary to identify derelict motor vehicles and cause the removal and disposal of such vehicles; to supervise any contract with a third party to provide for the removal and disposal of such vehicles; and to otherwise cause the implementation of and compliance with the provisions of this article.
(b)
Whenever any derelict motor vehicle is required to be removed from any private real property, with regard to those activities requiring entry onto such property, the designated city employee shall be a peace officer as defined by state law or this Code.
(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § III)
Sec. 82-74. - Procedures.
(a)
When any city employee designated by the city manager in accordance with this article shall ascertain that a motor vehicle and/or a part thereof is a derelict motor vehicle, or may become a derelict motor vehicle by remaining unattended for a period of ten days on public property and 30 days on private real property, provided that on the private real property, the vehicle is not enclosed in any fence, wall or other structure, and which totally obstructs it from public view, he shall prepare a notice to require such vehicle's removal and shall proceed to designate such vehicle as a derelict motor vehicle by affixing a copy of such notice to the vehicle, or part thereof, in a conspicuous place. The notice shall include the following information to the extent that it is available at the time of preparing such notice:
(1)
The vehicle serial number or manufacturer's identification number;
(2)
The vehicle license number;
(3)
The vehicle make, year and model;
(4)
The location of the vehicle;
(5)
The date of execution and placing of such notice on the vehicle; and
(6)
Such other information as may be required by the city manager.
The notice shall also contain the following statement:
"This vehicle has been left unattended on a public street, road or highway, or other public or private property in the City of Pooler. Unless removed by the owner within ten days on public property and 30 days on private property of the date of this notice, this vehicle will be removed at the direction of the city pursuant to the Derelict Motor Vehicle Ordinance of the City of Pooler and thereafter may be reclaimed only pursuant to such ordinance."
The notice set forth in this subsection shall be supplemented by an additional notice imprinted on a water-resistant material, printed with indelible ink, of a size not less than three inches by five inches, to adhere in wind and rain, to be affixed to a window of the vehicle separate from the notice required in this subsection, which shall contain the following language:
"This vehicle is subject to removal pursuant to the Derelict Motor Vehicle Ordinance of the City of Pooler within ten days on public property and 30 days on private property. If the official notice to remove is not elsewhere on this vehicle, please notify the city manager."
The time for removal of such vehicle commences when the notice is affixed to the derelict motor vehicle. The applicable time period is determined by the status of the property on which the vehicle is located when the notice is affixed. A presumption exists that the vehicle remained on the property where the notice was affixed during the notice period if it is present there on the date the notice period expires. If the vehicle is moved to property contiguous to where it was initially noticed and the property is of a different status to which another time period applies, the interval between the date of the initial notice shall be counted toward the time period applicable to the alternate property status on which the vehicle is located.
(b)
If at the expiration of the applicable period as provided in subsection (a) of this section after the posting of the notice, the derelict motor vehicle has not been removed from the public street, road or highway, or other public or private real property upon which it has remained for such period of time, any city employee designated by the city manager shall cause such vehicle to be removed for disposal. Upon the removal of any derelict motor vehicle, it shall be placed in an impounding area for a period of not less than 30 days, which shall be referred to as the "holding period" for the derelict motor vehicle. While being retained within the impounding area for the holding period, no person shall willfully remove any part from such vehicle, nor cause any damage thereto.
(c)
At any time prior to the expiration of the holding period as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the owner of the derelict motor vehicle, upon showing satisfactory evidence of ownership, may claim and take possession of the vehicle by making payment of such towing and storage charges as may have been incurred at the time in such amounts and in accordance with any requirements of the city manager and/or any contract executed by the city pursuant to this section.
(d)
Subsequent to the removal of any derelict motor vehicle and the placing of such vehicle in an impounding area, the owner of the vehicle shall be notified of its removal, impounding and right of reclamation as provided in subsection (c) of this section, provided that the name and address of the owner of the vehicle may be determined with reasonable diligence. Notice to the party entitled to receive notices may be given by placing a copy of such notice in the United States mail addressed to the party entitled to receive such notice, with adequate postage thereon, and shall be sent by certified mail to the addressee only, with a return receipt, within five calendar days after ascertaining the owner of such vehicle. If the notice is unclaimed or returned, no further mail notice shall be required. Any certified mail which is refused shall be deemed to have been delivered. If the notice is unclaimed or returned, the following provisions pertaining to a published notice shall be performed, but the name of the owner shall be specified in the notice rather than reference to an unknown owner, and the owner shall be stated to have an unknown address. Whenever the name of more than one owner is determined, each owner shall be entitled to notice pursuant to this subsection. Whenever it is impossible to determine the name or address of any party entitled to receive notice, notice shall be given to the party as an unknown owner or as an owner at an unknown address by publishing such notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city once a week for two consecutive weeks during the holding period. The notice shall contain information, to the extent it is available at the time of effecting such notice, specifying the:
(1)
Vehicle serial number or manufacturer's identification number;
(2)
Vehicle license number;
(3)
Vehicle make, year and model;
(4)
Location of the vehicle at the time of its removal;
(5)
Location of the impounding area where the vehicle is being stored;
(6)
Name and address of the party who is believed to be the present or last owner from such information as has been ascertained, or if none, then the owner will be stated to be unknown;
(7)
Name and address of the party having custody over the impounding area;
(8)
Date or expiration of the holding period for the vehicle; and
(9)
Right of the owner to reclaim such vehicle.
(e)
Subsequent to the expiration of the holding period, the derelict motor vehicle may be sold, destroyed, dismantled or otherwise disposed of at public or private sale by the city employee designated by the city manager to so act, or a third party with whom the city has contracted to so act, provided that the vehicle has not been claimed by its owner.
(f)
The city manager shall cause records to be made and maintained which reasonably specify the identity of each derelict motor vehicle; its owner; its location prior to removal; its date of removal; the party removing and impounding such vehicle; the date and manner of the vehicle's disposal; procedures to notify the owner and a copy of any notices given pursuant to this section; and such additional items as may by be required by the city manager. Such records shall be preserved for not less than two years from the date of impounding of any derelict motor vehicle and shall be made available for examination by any owner of such vehicle which has been removed pursuant to this section.
(g)
Any funds received by the city from the disposal of any derelict motor vehicle shall be paid to the general fund of the city.
(h)
If a derelict motor vehicle is removed from public property at the request of a law enforcement officer, or if the vehicle is stored if the owner of the vehicle is unknown, the party having possession or control of the vehicle shall seek the identity of and address of the last known registered owner of such vehicle within 72 hours of removal thereof.
(i)
If the derelict motor vehicle is removed from private property at the request of the property owner, or such vehicle is stored if the owner of the vehicle is unknown, the city police department shall be notified, in writing, of the location of the vehicle, the manufacturer's vehicle identification number (VIN), license number, model, year and make of the vehicle, within 72 hours of the removal of the vehicle, and shall seek from the city police department the identity and address of the last known registered owner of the vehicle, and any information indicating that the vehicle is a stolen vehicle.
(j)
If any derelict motor vehicle removed under subsections (h) and (i) of this section is determined to be a stolen vehicle, the city police department shall notify the state crime information center and the owner of such vehicle, if known, of the location of the vehicle, within 72 hours after receiving notice that the vehicle is a stolen vehicle.
(k)
If a derelict motor vehicle is not a stolen vehicle, being repaired by a repair facility or being stored by an insurance company for purposes of repair under a policy, the party having possession and control of the vehicle shall, within seven calendar days of the day the vehicle was removed, notify the owner, if known, of the location of the vehicle and the fees applicable to the removal and storage of the vehicle pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § IV)
Sec. 82-75. - Contractors.
(a)
Any party with whom the city may contract to perform services pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be an agent or employee of the city. Any act as authorized by this article shall be considered to be an act in the name of such party as an independent contractor.
(b)
Any party with whom the city has contracted to perform services pursuant to this article shall comply with all the terms and conditions of this article as may be required to be performed while in the custody and possession of a derelict motor vehicle by such party. Upon the failure of such party to comply with the terms and conditions of this article, such party shall not be entitled to any storage fees. Any party with whom the city shall contract to perform services pursuant to this article shall be licensed by the city to do such business.
(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § V)
Sec. 82-76. - Interference with city employees.

(Ord. of 3-16-1992, § VI)
Sec. 82-77. - Obstructing public property; removal.
Whenever a derelict motor vehicle is present on public property in such a place as to cause any obstruction to pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic, it shall not be necessary to comply with the provisions pertaining to the holding period set forth in section 82-74(b). In such an event, a peace officer or law enforcement officer shall be the person authorized to cause the removal of such vehicle to an impounding area as provided in this article.
