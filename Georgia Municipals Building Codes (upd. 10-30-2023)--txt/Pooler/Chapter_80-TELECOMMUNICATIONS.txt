The intent of this article is to provide standards for the development of wireless telecommunications facilities (WTFs) for personal wireless services and to:
(1)
Promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by regulating the siting of and establishing development standards for WTFs and related equipment and infrastructure.
(2)
Minimize the impacts of WTFs on surrounding areas by recognizing the variety of facilities and establishing standards for location, aesthetics, structural integrity and compatibility.
(3)
Encourage the location and collocation of wireless communication equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual, aesthetic and public safety impacts, effects upon the natural environment, and to reduce the need for additional WTFs.
(4)
Encourage coordination between suppliers and providers of personal wireless services in the City of Pooler (city).
(5)
Follow and promote the policies embodied in Section 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 in such a manner as to not unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services in the city.
(6)
Promote the orderly development of telecommunications infrastructure through coordination of master plans among the city and participating personal wireless service providers.
(7)
Protect the beauty and character of the city, particularly residential districts, recognized historic areas, and scenic vistas and landscapes, while meeting the needs of its citizens to enjoy the benefits of personal wireless services.
(8)
Encourage the use of public lands, buildings, and structures as locations for WTFs as a method to establish a precedence of quality concealment products that will minimize the aesthetic impact of related infrastructure.

To protect the beauty and character of the city, particularly residential districts, recognized historic areas and certain scenic vistas and landscapes as identified herein, all facilities shall be screened to the greatest extent possible. Screening shall occur through the use of design, existing buildings and structures, existing and proposed vegetation, appropriate materials and color. Unlike nonconcealed facilities, concealed facilities shall not be identifiable as a WTF.
EXPAND
Visibility of Facility
Screening and/or Concealment Techniques Applicable WCF Explanation
Design Concealed Attached

Concealed Freestanding Concealed Attached: Feed lines and antennas shall be designed to architecturally match the facade, roof, wall or structure on which they are affixed in order to blend in with the existing structural design, color and texture and in order to provide the least visually obtrusive profile.

Concealed Freestanding: Such facility shall blend into its surroundings through design and siting that is appropriate and typical to the context of the proposed location. Such facility shall also be designed to appear as a structure that would be allowed in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located and that is customary to the location (e.g., a smokestack would not be allowed in a residential district). Examples of concealed facilities include chimneys, steeples, clock towers, light poles, and flag poles. Guyed structure and lattice structure construction is not allowed.
Existing Buildings and Structures Nonconcealed Attached and Combined

Nonconcealed Freestanding Roof Mount: When a WTF extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, the WTF shall be camouflaged within or behind existing architectural features to limit the visibility from public rights-of-way. The WTF should be stepped back from the facade in order to limit its impact on the building's silhouette.

Side Mount: The WTF shall blend with the building's existing architecture and shall be painted or shielded with material which is consistent with the design features and materials of the building.

Freestanding Nonconcealed: To the extent possible, existing buildings and structures should be used to screen a WTF from rights-of-way.
Existing and Proposed Vegetation Nonconcealed Freestanding

NonconcealedAttached

Collocation and Combined Nonconcealed Freestanding: The perimeter of the WTF shall be at least 15 feet in width for landscaping and include: 1) a row of evergreen trees a minimum of 10 feet in height at the time of planting with a minimum two-inch caliper, spaced a maximum of 12 feet apart; and, 2) a row of evergreen shrubs a minimum of two feet tall at the time of planting, planted four feet on center. Within a year of planting, the trees and shrubs shall achieve 80 percent opacity of the security barrier and/or equipment enclosure. Existing trees and vegetation may be used as an alternative or in combination with new plantings to achieve the opacity requirement subject to approval of the City Council after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon a recommendation of the Director of the City Department of Park and Tree or his or her designee. An easement may be required to ensure that vegetation remains intact.

Nonconcealed Attached: To the extent possible, vegetation should be used to screen a WTF from full view.

Collocation and Combined: If the equipment compound and/or landscaping is not in compliance with this Article, compliance shall occur at the time of antenna installation. Landscaping compliance may be waived, wholly or partially, if the site lacks sufficient area.
Color Nonconcealed Freestanding

Attached Nonconcealed

Collocation and Combined Nonconcealed Freestanding: The WTF shall maintain a galvanized gray finish or the City Council after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission may accept other contextual or compatible color, except as required by federal rules or regulations.

Nonconcealed Attached: The WTF shall be painted and/or constructed of materials to match the color of the building or structure on which it is attached, except as required by federal rules or regulations.
Antenna Nonconcealed Freestanding The first antenna placement, and all subsequent collocated antennas, on new antenna support structures shall be flush-mounted, unless it is demonstrated through RF propagation analysis that such antennas will not meet the network objectives of the desired coverage area.
  (5)
Equipment compound and/or equipment cabinetry. Equipment related to the operation of a WTF shall be hidden and/or screened from public view by one or more of the following techniques, which shall also be consistent with the aesthetic/visibility standards identified in subsection (4):
a.
Ground equipment, including platforms. One or more of the following techniques can be used to hide and /or screen equipment:
1.
Locate equipment underground. If a nonconcealed freestanding WTF is proposed, an opaque security barrier consisting of brick, masonry, or other material approved by city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission shall be installed around the antenna support structure that will prevent unauthorized access to the structure. Landscaping as identified in subsection (4) shall be provided.
2.
Locate equipment within a building. The building shall be designed to be consistent with the prevailing architectural style of the neighborhood in which it is located, including exterior materials and roof pitch. The enclosure shall not exceed one story, unless location in a flood plain or other drainage concerns requires it to be elevated.
3.
Locate equipment behind a secured, landscaped perimeter. An evergreen landscape buffer shall surround the perimeter of the WTF. If this method is selected, the buffer requirements identified in subsection (4) apply. Additionally, an opaque fence (chain link with slats or webbing is not considered opaque) or masonry wall as approved by city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission shall be constructed to minimize opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti and other conditions that would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight and attractive nuisances. The fence or wall shall be no less than the above grade height of any equipment within the enclosure, which shall not be taller than one story, unless located in a flood zone.
