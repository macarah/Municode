ARTICLE 10. - HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 10.1. - Intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect the City of Luthersville historic areas from incompatible development and to advance long-term plans for these areas. The community finds that its historic overlay areas are important cultural and economic assets, critical to the City of Luthersville development, heritage tourism and heritage education goals, and ultimately to the public's long-term interest.
Zoning standards and regulations should protect these areas while advancing community development goals and furthering and protecting the public's health, safety and welfare. New construction in these areas should complement rather than interrupt, obscure, or otherwise damage or destroy the historic overlay areas.
