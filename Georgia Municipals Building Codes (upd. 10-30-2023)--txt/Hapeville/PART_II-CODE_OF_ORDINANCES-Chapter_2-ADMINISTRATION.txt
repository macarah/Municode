ARTICLE 6. - CODE OF ETHICS

Sec. 2-6-1. - Intent.
(a)
Declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that the mayor and council, city committees, boards, panels, public officials and city employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code of ethics and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city. This code of ethics shall apply to all officials, employees and members of boards and commissions, task forces, panels, and authorities of the city.
(b)
Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality, and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern.
(c)
Procurement of qualified leaders. It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the city of those men and women who are best qualified to serve. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided.
(d)
Dedicated service.
(1)
All officials and employees of the municipality should be loyal to the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointed officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.
(2)
Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the officially recognized confidential nature of their work.
(e)
Distribution of code. The city administrator is authorized and directed to have such number of said code of ethics printed as in his or her discretion will be sufficient for distribution to the officials, employees and board, panel, task forces, authorities, and commission members, as well as having copies available at the city hall for citizens of the city.

At the conclusion of all questions by board members, the chairman shall end the hearing and permit the board to deliberate in public. If the board decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the board shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require either the complainant or respondent, subject to the respondents right against self incrimination unless the same is waived by respondent, to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The board has no authority to continue the hearing past the 45-day deadline.

(13)
Receipt of additional evidence shall follow the same format outlined hereinabove. Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the board shall continue deliberation then the chairman shall call for a vote. The board's first vote must be whether or not the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the board rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the board, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by complainant, then the board must make a second decision by majority vote as to the appropriate penalty.
