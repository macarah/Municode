(c)
It is further declared to be the policy of the city to educate and encourage generators and handlers of solid waste to reduce and minimize to the greatest extent possible the amount of solid waste which requires collection, treatment, or disposal through source reduction, reuse, composting, recycling, and other methods and to promote markets for and engage in the purchase of goods made from recovered materials and goods which are recyclable.
(d)
The owner and/or occupant of every premise within the city shall be ultimately responsible for the proper handling, storage and disposal of all solid waste generated upon the property.

Sec. 30-25. - Collection of residential solid waste.
(a)
Receipt of service required. In order to protect the public health and sanitation, to prevent the spread of contagious or infectious diseases, and to prevent the breeding of rodents, insects and other vermin, all improved residential properties (single-family and multifamily residences) within the city shall receive regular municipal solid waste collection services from the city sanitation department. All residential customers will be provided once-per-week collection of their solid waste debris (solid waste and/or recycling depending on current schedule).

Such fee shall be imposed against the property itself and payment of the fee shall be enforceable and collected as provided by law for levy and sale of in rem liens.
(b)
Outside storage of residential solid waste; curbside containers. All residential solid waste stored outside the residence pending collection shall be placed inside approved containers with lids tightly affixed. Approved containers shall be those issued by the city to residential customers pursuant to this article, designed to be rolled to the curbside for periodic collection. All waste must be bagged and placed inside the container. Under no circumstances will garbage outside of city-issued containers be collected. If necessary, extra containers may be obtained for an additional monthly fee, as determined by the current fee schedule in affect at the time such additional cart is provided. Each container shall bear a serial number and shall be registered to the assigned customer. All containers shall remain the property of the city. Additionally, in the event a container is lost, stolen or intentionally damaged, the city reserves the right to charge the customer the replacement cost of the container. Except when taken to the curbside for scheduled collection, containers shall be consistently located behind the residence or to a place that is outside of city right-of-way and out of view to neighbors and passing motorist. Containers shall be used exclusively for the storage and transport of solid waste to the curbside.
(c)
Time and placement of containers. Beginning the evening before but no later than 6:00 a.m. on the day of collection customers shall place their containers at curbside in front of the customer's residence. The container (solid waste and/or recycling depending on current schedule) should be placed approximately four feet from the edge of the roadway, but not so as to pose a physical or visual obstruction to motorists. The containers may be placed at curbside the evening before the scheduled day for collection; for example, if the scheduled day for collection is Monday, containers may be placed at curbside on Sunday evening. All carts shall be placed with the front of the cart squarely facing the roadway, so as to be capable of being picked up by automated collection equipment. Where there is insufficient right-of-way adjacent to the roadway, or other topographical difficulties exist which make it unreasonable to conform to the general requirements, customers should place their container at a location mutually agreeable to the customer and the sanitation department, after consultation with the sanitation director or his designee. All containers should be removed from the curbside and returned to a location behind the customer's residence or to a place that is outside of city right-of-way and out of view from the right-of-way no later than 6:00 a.m. following the scheduled day of service. Due to holidays or other unforeseen circumstances, special collection dates will be announced or published through the local news media. Customers are encouraged to make suitable arrangements with neighbors or friends to set out and remove their containers from the right-of-way if absent during the hours specified herein; customers routinely allowing containers to remain at curbside outside of the hours specified shall be deemed to create a nuisance, punishable as a violation of this Code.
(d)
Assisted service for households with mobility-impaired residents. Households in which all regular residents are mobility-impaired may apply for assisted collection service at the same fee as levied for curbside collection. The containers must be placed at the street building line, visible from the street. Applications shall be made on forms provided by the sanitation department director or his designee, accompanied by the certificate of a physician licensed in the state stating that, based upon a physical examination conducted within the past 30 days, the applicant is mobility-impaired or has sufficient medical reasons not to place the container at curbside. Any denial of an application shall be in writing, stating the reason therefor. Aggrieved applicants may, within 20 days of the receipt of denial, request a hearing before the city manager, whose decision shall become final. The sanitation department may request recertification of a mobility-impaired customer annually. It shall be the duty of a mobility-impaired customer to report promptly to the sanitation department any change in medical condition or change in occupancy of the residence.
(e)
Service for multifamily residential developments.

The owner of the development shall decide on a common collection method to be used by all tenants. The owner shall have the option of being serviced by a centrally located commercial container, compactor or containers for curbside collection. It shall be the responsibility of each multifamily residential development to provide adequate containers for storage of its own waste if using centrally located commercial containers or compactors. Before a building permit shall be issued for construction of a new multifamily development, arrangements for the storage and collection of solid waste shall be approved pursuant to city development regulations. Commercial containers at existing multifamily developments serviced by the city sanitation department shall be placed at locations approved by the sanitation director. Any location to be used for centrally located commercial containers or compactors shall have proper infrastructure (i.e., dumpster pad, adequate paving, etc.) to accommodate collection vehicles and personnel.
