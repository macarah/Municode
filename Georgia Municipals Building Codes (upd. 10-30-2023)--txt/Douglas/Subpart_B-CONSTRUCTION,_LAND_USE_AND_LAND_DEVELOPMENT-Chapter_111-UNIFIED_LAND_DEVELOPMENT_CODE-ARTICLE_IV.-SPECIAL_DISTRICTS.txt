ARTICLE IV. - SPECIAL DISTRICTS

Sec. 111-105. - Downtown historic overlay district.
Areas of the city designated as "Historic Overlay Districts," but not designated as "Local Historic Properties" or "Local Historic Districts" specifically by local historic property or local historic district designation ordinances (and therefore under the jurisdiction of the historic preservation commission) fall under the jurisdiction of the design review board. An application for design review approved by the design review board shall be required before a building permit is issued on any improvement, grading, alteration of land or alteration of the exterior of any building commences, for all structures and uses in the Historic Overlay District (HOD).
(1)
An Historic Overlay District (HOD). An Historic Overlay District (HOD) may overlap other districts on the official zoning district map. Pursuant to the establishment of a design review board and the city commission's adoption of an historic overlay district ordinance, the design review board shall review all proposed new construction, development, exterior remodeling (other than ordinary maintenance), re-occupancy and/or demolition within the Historic Overlay District (HOD), and shall approve or deny all such construction, development, exterior remodeling, re-occupancy and/or demolition in accordance with the requirements as set forth in this section.
(2)
Intent and purpose. The intent and purpose of an historic overlay district ordinance is to provide procedures and standards for review and approval of site, landscaping, and exterior architectural design plans for development within the Historic Overlay District (HOD) in order to ensure that such development complies with the provisions of this section and meets design, development and preservation policies adopted by the city in order to:
a.
Enhance and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the city as an attractive and progressive community;
b.
Protect and maintain the value of existing buildings and property;
c.
Ensure architectural harmony between buildings and landscaping in order to promote and protect the aesthetic qualities of the city;
d.
Lessen traffic congestion and minimize traffic safety problems;
e.
Minimize any adverse impacts of new development on existing uses through provisions of screening, buffering, landscaping and other techniques;
f.
Protect public investment by mitigating impacts generated by new development on existing public facilities and utilities; and
g.
Enhance economic opportunities by maintaining the city as an attractive community for prospective developers, businesses and residents.
(3)
Application for design review. An application for design review approved by the design review board shall be required before a building permit is issued on any improvement, grading, alteration of land or alteration of the exterior of any building commences, for all structures and uses in the Historic Overlay District (HOD).
(4)
Approval of application for design review duration and extension. Approval of applications for design review submitted under the provisions of this section shall expire or be extended subject to the same provisions for building permits.
(5)
Pre-application meeting. Prior to the submittal of an application for design review, the applicant may meet with the building inspector and/or the design review board. The purpose of this informal meeting is to ensure the developer's understanding of this section and to inform the applicant of community design policies and standards and to provide an opportunity for review of any preliminary drawings and site plans.
(6)
Application for design review requirements. The specific administration requirements for any pre-application and final application for design review shall be established by the city; however, the application shall contain at least the following three elements, as applicable:
a.
Site analysis. A site analysis, with appropriate topographic data, shall include information on significant manmade and natural features and features to be retained, moved or altered;
b.
Site plan. A site plan at an appropriate scale with accompanying supporting information shall include information on proposed improvements, including internal circulation and parking, landscaping, grading, lighting, drainage, and amenities; and
c.
Architectural design. The architectural design element shall include scaled elevation drawings of proposed structures and information on building materials, colors, and items affecting exterior appearance, such as signs, air conditioning, grills, compressors and similar features. Applicants may use the Historic Preservation Design Guidelines created by the city historic preservation commission and the city as an informal guide, however, the design review board may develop its own specific requirements in addition to those contained in this section.
(7)
Application review. An application for design review shall be submitted in triplicate to the building inspector for review to ensure compliance with provisions of this section and for transmission of two copies to the design review board for review and final action. After the application for design review is submitted and accepted, the chairperson of the design review board shall call a formal meeting within 15 days of the application acceptance. Within 72 hours after the date of formal review meeting, the design review board shall take final action on the application for design review. If the design review board shall fail to take final action upon the application, the application shall be deemed to be approved. The design review board may extend this deadline if requested by the applicant. When circumstances necessitate, the design review board may defer action on an application until its next regularly scheduled meeting, but under no circumstances shall a deferment exceed this provision.
(8)
Decision of the design review board. The design review board shall take final action by rendering one of the following decisions on the applications for design review:
a.
Approval. The applicant shall be authorized to file for appropriate building permits in accordance with the application for design review. Upon approval of the application, the chairperson of the design review board shall notify the building inspector of the approval and transmit a copy of the approved application, with any conditions noted, to the building inspector;
b.
Conditional approval. The applicant shall be authorized to file for appropriate building permits with approved conditions or modifications to the application. Conditions imposed by the design review board shall be to achieve public purposes and shall still permit the developments as accorded high-quality similar developments within the city; or
c.
Denial. The applicant shall not be granted a building permit. The design review board shall specify in writing to the applicant and city commission the reasons for denial. The reasons for denial shall be negative impacts on the environment, property values, surrounding properties, or public health, safety and welfare.
(9)
Enforcement. All exterior architectural design and landscaping and other on-site improvements shall be completed in accordance with the approved application. The building inspector shall make periodic field inspections as required. If a violation is found to exist, the building inspector shall take immediate appropriate action to ensure compliance. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless all on-site improvements, landscaping, and exterior building facades are completed (or guaranteed through the posting of an acceptable performance bond) in accordance with the approved application. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued not to exceed 30 days wherein the on-site improvements can be completed within that timeframe and such conditions present no safety hazard.
(10)
Waiver. The design review board may waive administrative requirements of this section as needed to facilitate the review process, where such requirements are inappropriate or unnecessary.
(11)
General architectural requirements. The general architectural requirements listed in this section are minimum aesthetic standards for structures within the Historic Overlay District (HOD) regulated by the provisions of this section. These requirements shall be used by the design review board in reviewing applications and architectural design plans and drawings, and may be supplemented by specific architectural design policies and standards, as established by the design review board and approved by the city commission.
a.
It shall not be the intent of the architectural requirements of this section to prescribe a narrow range of exterior architectural design choices, but rather to encourage well-designed structures compatible with existing high-quality development in the immediate vicinity and in the surrounding area, and to prohibit poor-quality, garish, and/or incompatible design, which would have adverse effects on public and private investment; and
b.
Each application for design review shall be reviewed by the design review board, based upon, but not limited to, the following policies and standards:
1.
Design shall be in harmony with the general character of developments of high-quality in the immediate vicinity and the surrounding area, considering factors such as mass, building materials, placement, height, changing land use patterns, and consistency of exterior architectural treatment;
2.
Design components shall be planned in such a fashion that they are physically and aesthetically related and coordinated with other elements of the project and surrounding environment to ensure visual continuity of design;
3.
Design shall protect scenic views, particularly those of open space, and utilize natural features of the site;
4.
Design shall protect adjacent properties from negative visual and functional impacts; and
5.
All exterior forms, attached to buildings or detached, shall be in conformity to and secondary to the building.
(12)
General landscaping requirements. The landscaping requirements listed in this section are the minimum design standards for all development regulated under the provisions for the Historic Overlay District (HOD). These requirements shall be used by the design review board and the building inspector in reviewing applications and site plans, and may be supplemented by specific landscaping standards and specifications established by the design review board and approved by the city commission.
a.
Landscape design and planning shall be integrated with the overall design concept for the project; therefore, the design review board shall evaluate landscaping schemes as to their relationship to buildings and structures, as well as to the existing natural and developed landscapes, and to other adjacent landscaping on private property and public rights-of-way;
b.
Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or, at the applicant's option, replaced with suitable vegetation;
c.
Landscaping or privacy fences shall be used whenever possible to screen objectionable views or nuisances which are visible from the roadway, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, and similar features;
d.
Grassed areas shall be of sod or seeded with a variety suitable to the area that produces complete, permanent coverage;
e.
No artificial plants, trees, or other vegetation shall be installed;
f.
All landscaped areas shall be provided with a sprinkler system or readily available water supply; and
g.
All landscape design shall incorporate recommended best management practices (BMPs) for water conservation.
(13)
Tree requirements. The following tree and planting and maintenance requirements shall be met within the Historic Overlay District (HOD):
a.
Except as otherwise required by this section and to meet specific community design policies established by the city, trees shall be planted and/or retained in areas of the site to enhance the overall project design and to provide such amenities as visual attractiveness, natural resources protection and energy conservation;
b.
All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated so as to prevent damage from environmental changes resulting from any building or other improvement; and
c.
The design review board may vary the minimum landscaping and tree requirements of this section, if specific circumstances and/or site conditions warrant such actions.
(14)
Agreement and bonding. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer or owner may be required to post a performance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of one year after approval or acceptance thereof by the city in a sum established by the design review board, if specific circumstances and/or conditions warrant such action (such as intentional failure on the part of the owner or developer to comply with these provisions on a prior occasion or occasions). Such bond shall be in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all landscaping required in the approved design plan. At the end of one year, the building inspector shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer and the bond company of any replacements/corrections required to be made.
(15)
Maintenance. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping and other features of the design plan approved by the design review board.
(16)
Appeals. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the design review board shall be entitled to file an appeal with the governing body.
a.
Said appeal must be addressed and submitted in writing to the mayor and city commission;
b.
Said appeal shall set forth each and every basis upon which the application was approved or denied, and shall set forth each and every reason that the approval or denial should be overruled;
c.
The governing body shall then set a time and date at the next regular meeting of the city commission whereby the aggrieved party may come before it and submit proof to the city commission that the approval or denial is improper;
d.
The city commission shall afford the applicant sufficient time in which the applicant may address each reason that said aggrieved party contends the design review board was in error. The city commission shall then hear from a representative of the design review board as to why said application was originally approved or denied, and what positive or negative impact said structures would have on the city;
e.
The city commission may question the aggrieved party, the applicant and/or the design review board representative in order to clarify or expand upon the position taken by the aggrieved party, applicant and/or the design review board; and
f.
Thereafter, the mayor and city commission shall vote and decide whether to overrule the initial decision of the design review board or whether to permit the decision of the design review board to stand.

Modifications and/or mitigation. The historic preservation commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness based on modifications or mitigation that it sees fit, including, but not limited to:
A.
Requiring the applicant to adequately document the historic building in its original setting through photographs and/or measured drawings prior to demolition. In such cases, the historic preservation commission will review all recorded materials to ensure thorough documentation prior to granting a certificate of appropriateness for demolition;
B.
Only allowing the limited removal of structurally unsound construction on a building, in the interest of public safety, instead of the demolition of structurally sound additions which are not original to the building, but are significant examples of an accepted academic style and have become historic in their own right (50 years of age or older).
(4)
Approval of certificates of appropriateness. The historic preservation commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the historic preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts:
a.
Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation.

b.
In the event the historic preservation commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the historic preservation commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of the property will have 30 days in which to do this; and
c.
In the event that the condition is not remedied in the 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in subsection (14) of this section and, at the direction of the city commission, the historic preservation commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commissions.
(13)
Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this section or this article shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.
