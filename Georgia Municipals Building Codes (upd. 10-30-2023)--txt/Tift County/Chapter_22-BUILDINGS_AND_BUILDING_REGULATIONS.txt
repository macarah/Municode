Sec. 22-126. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Approved means accepted by the county.
Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural sources such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted or contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
Backflow means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended source.
Backflow by backpressure means the reverse flow of water caused when the downstream pressure becomes greater than the pressure in the potable water supply system.
Backflow by backsiphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system.
Backflow preventer means a device or means designed to prevent backflow, as follows:
(1)
Air-gap means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel, and in no case less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable water system, an emergency bypass shall be installed around the air-gap system and an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the bypass system.
(2)
Reduced pressure principle device means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valve between the two check valves, tightly closing shutoff valves on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and county-approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at a level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged.
(3)
Double check valve assembly means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shutoff valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention devices. To be approved these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing.
Building official means building official of the county.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
Cross connection means any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection between a public potable water distribution system and a customer's water distribution system which is cross connected to a contaminated fixture, industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary water system, constitutes one type of cross connection. Other types of cross connections include connectors such as swing connection, removable sections, four-way valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices, sliding multiport tube, solid connections, etc.
Cross connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying cross connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of cross connection.
Cross connection control coordinator means the cross connection control coordinator of the county.
Cross connections, controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Hazard, degree of means derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system of the county.
(1)
Hazard, contamination means any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create or, in the judgement of the county, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. An example of a health hazard is the structural defect, including cross connections, in a water supply system.
(2)
Hazard, plumbing means a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap separation or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing type cross connections are considered to be a health hazard.
(3)
Hazard, pollutional means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system, but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
(4)
Hazard, system means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
Industrial fluids system means any system located within the unincorporated area of the county containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water system. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies, circulated cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acidic solutions and other liquids and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes.
Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health, but which does adversely and unreasonably effect such waters for domestic use.
Water, potable means any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption.
Water, nonpotable means water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability.
Water, service connections means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system; i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connections shall also include water service connections from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.
Water, used means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
