Chapter 30 - SUBDIVISIONS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 30-001. - General requirements and minimum standards.
A.
A well designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all the necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, every subdivider/developer shall be required to make the improvements outlined in this chapter in accordance with the specifications herein or otherwise adopted by the city council. The improvements may be made by the appropriate local authority at the expense of the subdivider/developer or the subdivider/developer can make the improvements with the approval of the appropriate local authority.
B.
All existing roads in the city are hereby classified as shown on the official city street map adopted by the city council. Any improved road and any new road shall, upon acceptance and dedication, be classified by the city engineer subject to review by the city council.
C.
Future thoroughfare and other street plans shall be shown on the official city street map. All roads and other features of the thoroughfare plan for the city shall be platted by the subdivider/developer in the location and to the dimension indicated on the thoroughfare plan adopted by the city council.
D.
Approval of any proposed development may be denied, if the city council determines that such developments would necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for the provision of maintenance of such roadways.
E.
Where proposed subdivisions and proposed developments about existing or dedicated or platted streets and the right-of-way of said streets are inadequate, the subdivider/developer shall provide to the city a deeded right-of-way to meet the minimum standards and proposed routing of the roadway. Right-of-way shall be provided from the centerline of the existing public city roadway along all lands abutting said roadway or right-of-way on both sides of the centerline when property lies along both sides of the roadway. The subdivider/developer is responsible for the length of city street through the length of the development. The subdivider/developer shall give the required right-of-way as follows:
1.
If the subdivider/developer owns property on both sides of the city street, the right-of-way will be taken equally from each side of the centerline.
2.
If the subdivider/developer only owns property on one side, the additional required right-of-way shall be taken from the subdivider/developer's property.
F.
The subdivider/developer shall submit construction plans and a cost estimate to the planning and zoning office. The plans shall be reviewed by staff and the planning and zoning commission. Once the planning and zoning commission approves the plans, the subdivider/developer shall pay the amount set by the planning and zoning commission into the appropriate paving fund. It will be the incumbent upon the subdivider/developer to furnish and install a driveway or driveways from the existing, or dedicated or platted ways to each prior to the sale of the lot or the issuance of any building permits for the lot.
G.
The subdivider/developer shall incur the cost of construction and installation of all required public improvements as shown upon the developer's approved construction plans including but limited to drives, roads, storm drainage systems, fire hydrants, dry fire hydrants, water lines and sanitary sewers.

The zoning administrator shall return, within 30 days, the submitted sketch plans to the subdivider where the plans do not comply with the regulations set forth in this resolution. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review and no formal application shall be required.

(Ord. of 3-11-2008, § 31-007)
Sec. 30-008. - Provision for public land.
A.
Dedication or reservation for public use. Where features of the comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces are located in whole or part in a proposed development, or when these features have not been anticipated by the comprehensive plan, but are considered essential by the council, such features shall be dedicated or reserved by the developer. Provided, however, that no more than ten percent of the total area of the proposed development, exclusive of street right-of-ways, shall be required for dedication or reservation to fulfill the requirements of this section.
B.
Land not required or suited for public use. Whenever a plat proposes the reservation of land for, or the dedication of land to, public use, and the council finds that such land is not suitable for public use, the council may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land. The council shall waive the reservation or dedication provisions whenever the public body directly responsible for land acquisition executes a written release, stating that such planned feature is not required or is not to be acquired. In the absence of such a waiver, the council shall disapprove plats when planned features, as specified by the comprehensive plan or deemed essential by the council, are not incorporated into the plat.
C.
Dedication. The developer may deed restrictively the land to be used for a specified public use to the city by submitting, with the final plat and documents, a deed to the property involved, clear of all liens and encumbrances, and transferable to the division of the city government which will have ultimate control over the use of such property, provided that the governing body is not obligated to accept.
D.
Reservations. In the event the developer feels that a donation through dedication would work as unusual hardship on him, he may elect to reserve the area in question. Whenever the land reserved is not purchased, acquired, optioned, or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a three-year period from the date or recording the development plat or at the time that at least 50 percent of the available lots are built on and occupied, the developer may claim the original reservation and cause it to be developed in a manner suitable to the developer subject to the provisions of this chapter.
