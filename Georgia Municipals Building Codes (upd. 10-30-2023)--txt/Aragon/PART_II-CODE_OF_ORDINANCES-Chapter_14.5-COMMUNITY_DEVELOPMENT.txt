Chapter 14.5 - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 14.5-1. - City Wide Enterprise Zone.
In accordance with the 2013 revision of the Urban Redevelopment Plan and the Georgia Enterprise Zone Employment Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-88-1 et seq. (hereinafter "the Act"), the city hereby designates the City Wide Enterprise Zone within the Aragon Urban Redevelopment Area. This zone meets the qualifications and criteria of the Act due to the existence of the following:
(1)
General distress. The high crime rate and presence of abandoned structures within the City Wide Enterprise Zone satisfies the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(d) for general distress.
(2)
Pervasive poverty. All parcels within the City Wide Enterprise Zone are in census blocks which have or are adjacent to census blocks which have 15 percent or greater poverty according to the 2010 Census. This satisfies the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(a).
(3)
General blight. The proposed Enterprise Zone is within an approved Urban Redevelopment Area; thus, the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(f) demonstrating blight is satisfied.
(4)
Legal description. The area of the City Wide Enterprise Zone includes all parcels within the corporate limits of the city.
(5)
Tax abatement. Property owners qualifying under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-4(b) or 36-88-8(b) shall receive the lesser of $2,500.00 per year or the maximum property tax abatement allowed under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-8(a)(1).
