ARTICLE III. - FEEDING OF DUCKS, BIRDS, ETC., ON PUBLIC PROPERTY

Sec. 10-82. - Findings.
(a)
The city, in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and its wildlife by prohibiting the feeding of as well as creating a condition which results in a congregation or congestion of domestic and migratory waterfowl within the city, finds that feeding the waterfowl increases the potential for damage to public parks, may cause water quality problems and may increase the potential for the spread of disease to residents.
(b)
In addition, it is the intent of this article to protect the welfare of the waterfowl and migratory birds themselves, since wildlife studies have shown that the feeding of waterfowl and migratory birds can interrupt their normal migration patterns, cause nutritional problems, and promote the spread of serious waterfowl/migratory bird diseases such as avian cholera, plague and botulism.
(c)
It is also the intent of this article to minimize the attraction of these birds by restricting their feeding and other acts that encourage the birds to halt their migrations and to reside in the city.
