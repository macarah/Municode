Sec. 12-29. - Lien taken for delinquent occupation tax.
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the occupational tax officer of Douglas County, Georgia, upon any tax of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the county of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by the ordinances of said county and the laws of Georgia. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the appropriate officer of said county upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances of said county and the laws of Georgia, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.
