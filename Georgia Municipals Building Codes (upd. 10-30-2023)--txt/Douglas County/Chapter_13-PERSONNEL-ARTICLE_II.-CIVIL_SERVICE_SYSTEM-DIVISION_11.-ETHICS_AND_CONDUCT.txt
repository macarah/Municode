Sec. 13-146. - County dress code.
(a)
Appearance is an important part of community relations and it is not only important that employees be courteous and efficient but that they also contribute favorably to the county's image through proper dress and personal grooming. Employees should appear on the premises appropriately and modestly dressed, neat and clean in person, and in clothing that is devoid of unpleasant perfumes and body odors. Good taste must be displayed with regard to fit. Tight, extremely baggy, low cut or revealing garments are not acceptable for the work setting. Appropriate appearance includes hairstyles.
(b)
The following should be considered a set of standards and guidelines for what is appropriate to wear in the workplace and to provide consistency in the type of dress worn throughout the county. (Please note that department heads reserve the right to require change in an employee's attire if it is deemed inappropriate.)
(1)
Female personnel: Hair should be neat and clean. Dresses or pantsuits should be modest. Denim may be worn in denim coordinates. Employees should be properly attired, and this means no halters, shorts, blue jeans, see-through blouses or slogan T-shirts.
It shall be the policy of the Douglas County Board of Commissioners that office employees who are not designated to wear uniforms will be permitted to wear split skirts upon the approval of their supervisor. Employees who work outside the office environment will be allowed to wear jeans, split skirts, capris leggings are acceptable if worn with appropriate coverings (long blouse, dress or tunic), and shorts upon the approval of their supervisor. The clothing must not be higher than two (2) inches above the middle of the knee. Supervisors who approve clothing under this policy must assure that it provides a well-mannered and professional appearance for the employees. Clothing with holes, torn, dirty, or similar appearance is not acceptable.
(2)
Male personnel: Hair should be kept neat and clean and above collar. Faddish and long hairstyles are not appropriate in the professional departments and are not considered safe for the maintenance or construction related employees.
For reasons of safety, no facial hair, except a moustache, may be worn by a firefighter or deputy Sheriff unless approved by department head (ie, undercover, etc.)
Unless you are required to wear a uniform or if your position requires a specific type of clothing, daily attire for men should include knit slacks, dress pants, Khakis, long/short sleeve dress shirts, button down shirts and polo style shirts. This does not include tank tops, shorts, blue jeans, see through shirts or slogan T-Shirts.
(3)
Footwear: In an effort to keep the workplace safe and the environment professional, the following shoe types should not be worn to work; flip flops, excessively worn or soiled shoes, or any shoes that the department head feels is inadequate for the workplace and the environment in which it is worn.
Employees are required to wear their county identification badges where visible at all times while at work.
Exceptions:
•
Special accommodations may be made for this dress code, based upon health reasons documented by a physician's note.
•
Exceptions to these guidelines shall be made for those departments that have a specific dress code or uniforms (public safety, maintenance, transportation, appraisal, property management, etc.) or for employees who regularly work outdoors.
•
The department head has the discretion to make adaptions to the dress code guidelines for special events.
•
Please use the aforementioned standards and guidelines as a benchmark for casual Fridays.

Sec. 13-147. - Non-harassment policy.
It is the firm policy of the county to maintain a workplace free from unwanted harassment based upon race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran's status or any other status protected by applicable state, federal or local law. All such harassment is prohibited. Retaliation against employees or prospective employees reporting harassment is also prohibited.
Harassment. Unlawful harassment is prohibited by the policy and consists of verbal or physical conduct that is abusive toward an individual. Such prohibited harassment may occur because of that individual's race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran's status or other prohibited reason that has the purpose or effect of:
(1)
Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment;
(2)
Unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or
(3)
Otherwise adversely affecting an individual's employment opportunities.
Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to:
(1)
Epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening, intimidating or hostile acts that relate to race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran's status or other prohibited reason; and
(2)
Written or graphic materials which are abusive towards an individual or group because of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, disability, veteran's status or other prohibited reason and which are communicated on walls, bulletin boards, through electronic communications, or otherwise circulated in the workplace.
This policy extends to all electronic and voice mail communications.
Sexual harassment. All county employees must be allowed to work in an environment free from unsolicited and unwelcomed sexual conduct and comments. Sexual harassment is a violation of the law and of this policy. Sexual harassment is defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
(1)
Submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment.
(2)
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or
(3)
The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments. It refers to behavior which is not welcome, which is personally offensive, which debilitates morale, and which therefore interferes with the work effectiveness of the individual harassed. Sexual harassment may occur between employees or between employees and suppliers/customers and is not limited to employees and supervisors.
Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to, the following:
•
Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, unwanted sexual advances, or sexually-oriented verbal "kidding" or abuse;
•
Physical conduct, such as unwanted touching, patting, pinching, blocking normal movement or assault;
•
Subtle pressure for sexual activity;
•
Demands to submit to sexual requests, accompanied by implied or direct promises of preferential treatment or threats concerning an individual's employment status;
•
Visual harassment such as sexually-explicit or sexually-derogatory posters, obscene gestures; cartoons, photographs, or drawings; or
•
Retaliation for opposing, reporting or threatening to report unlawful harassment, or for participating in an investigation, proceeding or hearing regarding potential harassment.
Employee responsibility. Employees should not tolerate harassing conduct. Any employee who believes that he or she has experienced unlawful harassment in connection with his or her employment or who is aware of the harassment of other employees or prospective employees has a duty to report the potential policy violation so that the appropriate corrective action may be taken.
All employees are responsible to ensure that they do not participate in, promote or support any form of harassment that affects the workplace.
Management responsibility. Managers and supervisors are to comply with the county's anti-harassment policy and to prevent and correct any harassment prohibited by the Policy. Managers and supervisors are responsible to ensure that the employees in their areas are aware of the policy and that any and all complaints of harassment are promptly and properly investigated and any appropriate action taken. The personnel department is available for consultation.
Complaint procedure Any employee or prospective employee who experiences harassment in connection with his or her employment, or who is aware of the harassment of other employees or prospective employees, should immediately contact his or her supervisor, or the human resources director or the county administrator. If you have made a complaint which you believe has not been properly addressed or resolved, you should immediately contact the human resources director or the county administrator. Complaints should be in writing where possible and should include all details, specifying all names, dates, times, etc.
Any reported violation of this policy will receive prompt and appropriate action. The county will investigate all complaints alleging harassment and all instances potentially constituting harassment that come to its attention. When conducting an investigation, care will be taken to protect confidentiality to the degree possible, while still permitting the county to conduct the investigation and to comply with applicable federal, state and local law.
Following an investigation, the county will take prompt and appropriate corrective action to remedy any harassment. Employees who are found to engage in harassment will be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination.
If a harassment complaint is direct against a county representative normally involved in processing such complaints, the functions assigned to the (those) person(s) by these procedures will be transferred to a superior as designated by senior county management.
No retaliation. The county strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee for using the complaint procedure or for truthfully and in good faith filing, testifying, assisting in or participation in any manner in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing regarding potential harassment.

Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Sept. 15, 1992, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, its inclusion herein as § 13-147 was at the discretion of the editor.
Sec. 13-148. - Drug-free workplace statement.
The county is a drug-free workplace.
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the workplace, and disciplinary action will result for violation of this prohibition pursuant to the county merit system, section 13-101 (9). Disciplinary action includes; reprimand, probation, suspension, demotion/reduction in salary, and termination. If an employee is convicted of a criminal drug statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, use, or possession of any controlled substance for a violation occurring in the workplace, the employee must notify the director of human resources within five (5) days of such conviction. A conviction includes a plea of nolo contendere. As a condition of employment, an employee is required to abide by the terms of this drug-free workplace statement.
Any individual covered by this policy may be subject to a fitness for duty evaluation, and urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the short-term effects of substance abuse or alcohol misuse.
Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made or authorized by a supervisor who is trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who reasonably concludes that an individual covered by this policy may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse.
As a condition of employment, an employee is required to abide by the terms of this drug-free workplace statement.
If an employee needs information, assistance, and/or counseling on the dangers of drug abuse in the work-place, the employee may contact the director of human resources or the county's E.A.P. services to be directed to an agency or person who can provide assistance.
