ARTICLE XI. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 42-724. - Statutory authorization.
The Constitution of the State of Georgia provides in Article IX, Section II, delegated responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Fannin County, Georgia, board of commissioners does hereby ordain this article.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XIII, art. I(A))
Sec. 42-725. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Fannin County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XIII, art. I(B))
Sec. 42-726. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to the health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging or other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XIII, art. I(C))
Sec. 42-727. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain;
(3)

(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XIII, art. II, § G)
Sec. 42-735. - Penalties for violation.
Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall be subject to a fine of not more than $300.00 under the procedures outlined in section 42-360. Said person shall be liable for all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the board of commissioners of Fannin County, Georgia, from taking such other lawful actions as are necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XIII, art. II, § H)
Sec. 42-736. - Variances.
(a)
The Fannin County board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the land development officer in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners of Fannin County may appeal such decision the superior court of Fannin County.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to reserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the Fannin County board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The land development officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Fannin County board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
