ARTICLE VIII. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 42-506. - Purpose, authority, etc.
(a)
Findings.
(1)
The wetlands in Fannin County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on the upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(c)
Authority. See section 42-410(c).
(d)
Jurisdiction. See section 42-410(d).
(e)
Cite. This article shall be known and cited as the "Wetlands Protection Ordinance."
(f)
Interpretation. See section 42-410(f).

Sec. 42-507. - Wetlands protection district established.
(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Fannin County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wetlands inventory maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Fannin County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. X, art. II)
Sec. 42-508. - Protection criteria.
(a)
Local permit or permission required. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the Fannin County land development office.
(b)
Army Corps of Engineers' determination. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the Fannin County land development officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
