Sec. 46-1. - Loitering or prowling.
(a)
A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(b)
Among the circumstances that may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrests for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern that would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have expelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(c)
A person committing the offense of loitering or prowling shall be guilty of a violation of this section and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in section 1-12.
