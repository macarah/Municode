ARTICLE II. - STANDARDS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES

Sec. 28-26. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of all wireless communications towers and antennas which will encourage the development of a competitive wireless communications marketplace while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public and maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the community. The goals of this article are:
(1)
To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact of telecommunications towers, antenna support structures and wireless communications facilities;
(2)
To minimize the total number of towers and antennas within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of the county;
(3)
To promote and encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites among service providers;
(4)
To locate telecommunications towers and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
(5)
To encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas to minimize adverse visual impacts;
(6)
To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless communications facilities by insuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed when no longer used or when determined to be structurally unsound;
(7)
To enhance the ability of the providers of wireless communications services to deliver such services to the community effectively and efficiently; and
(8)
To preserve those areas of significant scenic or historic merit.

(1)
Through technology which has been demonstrated in actual applications (not simply through tests or experiments) to operate in a workable manner; and
(2)
In a manner which has a reasonable likelihood of generating a reasonable profit or other financial benefits, when measured over the term of the lease.
Height. When referring to a tower or other structure, height means a distance measured from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on the tower or other structure, including the base pad and any antenna.
Historic or scenic views. Geographic areas in the county which have been formally designated on the National Historic Register; have been included in any nature preserve or scenic preservation efforts; have been identified in the county comprehensive plan; or have sufficient historic or scenic merit as determined by the planning and zoning department or the board of commissioners. A scenic view may be from a stationary viewpoint or be seen as one travels along a roadway or path.
Microcell. A wireless communication facility comprising an antenna extending no more than four feet above the structure to which it is attached, and with an area no larger than 576 square inches (e.g. 3' × 1½' panel antenna or 2' diameter parabolic antenna) as viewed from any one point.
Preexisting towers and preexisting antenna. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supported or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers and cellular telephone or PCS towers.
Principal use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure.
Tower. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supported or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone or PCS towers.
Wireless transmission facilities. The buildings, cabinets, equipment and property, including but not limited to, generating and switching stations, repeaters, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, pedestals, antennas, towers, alternative tower structures, electronics and other appurtenances used to transmit, receive, distribute, provide or offer low-power mobile voice transmission, data transmission or other wireless communications by linking a wireless network of radio wave transmitting devices through a series of short range, contiguous cells that are part of an evolving cell grid.

(Ord. of 2-5-2001(2); Ord. of 9-15-2003(1); Ord. of 1-12-2021 )
Sec. 28-31. - Approval process.
(a)
Uses subject to administrative approval. Subject to certification by the planning director of compliance with the general requirements, development requirements and standards enumerated above, the following uses may be administratively approved within 30 days of receiving application, supporting engineering certification and lease approval, if any, without the necessity of public hearing.
(1)
Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the county provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible and a license, permit or lease authorizing such tower is thereafter approved by the county.
(2)
Installing an antenna on an existing structure, so long as said installation is considered to be a stealth technology installation that does not significantly change the profile of the existing structure and so that the installation is not readily noticeable to the untrained eye. Such installations including cables leading to the antennas shall be painted to match the paint and colors on the existing structure and shall not protrude from the existing structure in a noticeable fashion.
(3)
Co-location by installing an antenna on any existing tower or alternative tower structure.
(4)
Replacing an existing tower with a new tower designed to accommodate two or more users so long as such new tower does not exceed the height limitations of subsection 28-30(f) and setback requirements of this article are met. After the replacement tower is built only one tower shall remain on such site. Support equipment shall, where technically feasible, be located underground.
(5)
Locating any alternative tower structures (manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, or light poles that, based on staff determination, effectively camouflage or conceal towers and antennas) provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or otherwise incorporated into the alternative structure.
(6)
Installing any antenna or tower not to exceed the limitations contained in subsection 28-30(f) and provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or shielded to the satisfaction of the planning director or his/her designee.
(7)
Constructing and installing a new tower that will host First Responders Network Authority (FirstNet) or services of similar import that benefit first responders and enhance public safety.
If the planning director or his/her designee determine that any application for an administratively approved use does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, administrative approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Such evidence shall be summarized for the applicant along with a recommendation as to whether the applicant should pursue a variance or proceed to a public hearing as specified in subsection (b) below. Applicants may appeal the administrative denial to the county board of commissioners pursuant to the procedures described in article XX, policies and procedures, section 70-689, public hearing process, of the zoning chapter. Any other party aggrieved by the decision of the planning director or his/her designee may file an appeal to the board of commissioners including payment of the filing fee. For purposes of this section an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated.
The board of commissioners shall dispense with the appeal by either:
(8)
A determination that the application is valid and meets all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article, which shall result in the issuance of a permit.
(9)
A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an approved administratively use under this article, but, owing to special conditions, a variance as to separation or setback requirements:
a.
Will not be contrary to the public interest;
b.
Will relieve unnecessary hardship; and
c.
Shall preserve the intent and spirit of this article.
(10)
A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article and the deficiencies cannot, subject to the conditions listed above, properly be cured by a variance.
Applications which do not satisfy all applicable criteria must, as a result, apply for a public hearing before the board of commissioners as specified in subsection (b) below.
(b)
Other uses—Public hearing required.
(1)
If the proposed tower or antenna is not included under the above described administratively approved uses, or the application does not on its face satisfy the development standards and other criteria specified herein, then a public hearing before the board of commissioners shall be required for the approval of the construction of a wireless transmission facility in all zoning districts. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the planning and zoning department and pay the required fee at such time. Applications, when complete, shall be placed on the next available agenda of the board of commissioners. At least 30 days prior to any scheduled hearing, the planning and zoning department shall cause a sign to be posted on the property and the publication of a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation. Said notice shall state the nature of the application, street location of the proposal and height of the proposed structure.
(2)
Before approving an application for an "other use," the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. The factors considered in granting such a permit include those enumerated in sections 28-29 and 28-30. The board of commissioners may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in their discretion doing so will advance the goals of this article as stated in section 28-26.

If, upon inspection, the county concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice to the applicant, said applicant shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the applicant fails to bring the tower into compliance within the 15 days, the county may remove the tower at the applicant's expense. Prior to removal of any tower, the county may consider detailed plans submitted by the applicant for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17.
(c)
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17.
(d)
All maintenance or construction on wireless transmission facilities shall be performed by persons employed by or under contract to the owner between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday except in cases of emergency. Access to facilities on county owned property shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the department responsible for such property. The hours of access to county sites shall not exceed those specified above. Persons may not be present on site unless performing construction or maintenance at such site.
(e)
The owner or user of any telecommunications facility shall be required to submit a "facility in use certification" annually to the license and permits department. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months or is not properly maintained shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same and any structures housing supporting equipment within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed or returned to good condition within said 90 days, the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
