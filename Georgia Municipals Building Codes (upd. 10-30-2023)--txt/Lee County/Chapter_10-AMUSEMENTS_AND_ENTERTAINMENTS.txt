DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose.
The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment businesses. However, the board of commissioners also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish a balance between the protections afforded by the First Amendment and the public health, safety and welfare of the citizenry of the county and reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate government interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.

If a license is suspended or revoked by the business inspector, the licensee may appeal the decision of the business inspector to the board of commissioners by filing a written notice of appeal with the business inspector within ten days from the effective date of written notice received by the licensee in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a memorandum, or other writing, setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in support of the appeal. The business inspector may submit a memorandum in response to the memorandum filed by the licensee upon appeal to the board of commissioners. The business inspector's decision shall be final unless an appeal is timely filed. An appeal shall stay the business inspector's decision until the appeal is heard or withdrawn. The business inspector shall place the appeal on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners occurring not less than five nor more than 30 days after receipt of the appeal.

The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in this article.
(2)
The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the action of the board of commissioners.
(f)
At any hearing, the hearing officer shall receive oral and written testimony regarding the appeal. Hearings shall be conducted under rules issued by the hearing officer, which shall be consistent with rules applied in administrative proceedings, and shall ensure that each party may present evidence, cross examine witnesses, and be represented by legal counsel.
(g)
The hearing officer shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding 15 days from the termination date of such hearing, submit a written report to the board of commissioners. Such report shall contain a brief summary of the evidence considered, and state the findings, conclusions and recommendations. The report shall recommend that the board of commissioners sustain, overrule or modify the action of the business inspector. The report shall be filed with the business inspector and shall be considered a public record. A copy of such report shall be forwarded, by certified mail, to the appellant on the same day it is filed with the business inspector. The business inspector shall place the hearing officer's report on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners for their action as deemed appropriate.
(h)
The board of commissioners may adopt or reject the hearing officer's decision in its entirety or may modify the proposed recommendation.
