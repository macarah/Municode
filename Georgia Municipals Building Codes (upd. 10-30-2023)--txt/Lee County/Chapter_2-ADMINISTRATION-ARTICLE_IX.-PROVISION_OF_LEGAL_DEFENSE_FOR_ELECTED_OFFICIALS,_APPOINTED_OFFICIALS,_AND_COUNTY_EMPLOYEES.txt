Sec. 2-401. - Civil actionsâ€”Payment of costs of defense.
Any county elected or appointed official, and any county employee, against whom any civil action (as herein defined) is brought or threatened by reason of any action taken by such county officer, county appointed official, or county employee taken in good faith in the course of his or her duties shall be indemnified by Lee County from Lee County's general fund for the costs of defense, including reasonable attorney's fees, actually paid or incurred by such county officer, county appointed official, or county employee in connection with proceedings related to the defense or settlement of such action. Such costs of defense shall only be authorized for payment upon compliance with and subject to the following:
(1)
A detailed written request regarding the payment of costs of defense under this article shall be submitted by the county elected official, county appointed official, or county employee seeking such reimbursement to the county manager, and if, after review of the request, the county manager determines that there is probable cause to believe that such request may be sufficient to authorize payment of the costs of defense under this article, then such request shall be submitted to the board of commissioners for consideration at the next county commission voting meeting which is scheduled to occur no sooner than 30 days of the date such request is submitted. Such written request shall contain, at a minimum, identification of the claimants, the basis of the claim, the reason why the claim cannot be defended by the county attorney or legal counsel hired by the county's liability insurance carrier, the estimate of the total costs of defense that would be paid by the county, and such other information as may be required by the county manager.
(2)
No such costs shall be paid except upon approval of the governing body of the county. Any attorney's fees paid shall be based upon reasonable hourly rate charges for such attorney and, unless agreed by the governing body, such hourly rate for attorney's fees shall not exceed the normal hourly rate then charged by the county attorney. Fees charged for paralegal time shall be no greater than one-half of the attorney's fees paid to the attorney. The governing body shall be authorized to impose a maximum amount of costs of defense which it will pay in connection with any particular civil action or in connection with any particular county elected official, county appointed official, or county employee, and any approval of the payment of the costs of defense shall not prohibit the governing body from rejecting future payment requests in connection with the same civil action.
(3)
The attorney selected to provide a defense for the county official, county appointee, or county employee shall be selected by the county official, county appointee, or county employee in his or her sole discretion, and any costs of defense not covered in accord with the provisions of this article shall be the sole responsibility of the county official, county appointee, or county employee, and Lee County shall have no liability therefor.
(4)
No costs of defense shall be payable hereunder for any such costs that were incurred by the county elected official, appointed official, or county employee prior to the date of approval of the payment of defense costs for the elected official, appointed official, or county employee in connection with the subject civil action unless the governing body determines that the previously incurred costs of defense would have been paid hereunder except for the legal inability of the county elected official, appointed official, or county employee to make such request under this article or for the excusable neglect of the county elected official, appointed official, or county employee in failing to submit such request in a timely manner.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, a count elected official, county appointee, or county employee shall not be authorized to hire or retain outside counsel under this article where a civil action is being defended or is to be defended by the county attorney or by legal counsel retained by the county's liability insurance carrier unless there are claims raised in the civil action which are not claims covered by the county's liability insurance and the county attorney is unable to defend such claims due to a conflict of interest or for some other reason as determined by either the county attorney or the board of commissioners. In such event, outside counsel shall only provide a defense in connection with such claims that are not covered by such insurance and shall not, in any manner, replace or duplicate the legal defense being provided by the county attorney or the attorney hired by the county's liability insurance carrier. Unless there is a conflict of interest, if outside counsel is hired, the county attorney shall monitor the legal proceedings, and shall make such reports to the board of commissioners as he or she may deem appropriate or as requested by the board regarding the civil action.
