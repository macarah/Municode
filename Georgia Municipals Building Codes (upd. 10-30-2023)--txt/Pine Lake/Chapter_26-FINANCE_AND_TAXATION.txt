Sec. 26-21. - Introduction.
(a)
Purchasing is the procurement of supplies, equipment and services at the lowest prices consistent with the quality needed for the effective operations of the departments of the City of Pine Lake. This procurement is an important function of the city, and for any purchasing department to be truly effective, there must be full cooperation between all departments. Serving the needs of each department will be the foremost consideration of the purchasing department. However, to obtain the greatest value for every dollar spent it is necessary to follow a set of procedures when purchases are made.
(b)
The procedures outlined are to be used by all city employees in requesting and purchasing equipment and supplies.
(c)
Changes will be issued as new procedures are approved.
