Revisions to current Code: The ARB will provide recommended revisions to current land development regulations to better assure that residential and commercial development will be undertaken in a manner that: (i) has minimal negative impact on the city's existing traffic infrastructure, floodplains lake and wetlands; and (ii) provides protection to community from the increases in storm water runoff caused by construction of impervious cover; and (iii) provides meaningful protection of the communities trees and other natural resources and (iv) provides a methodology for new development to provide public facilities (such as parkland) proportional to the new development's impact on such public facilities.
(2)
Development guidelines: Recommend development guidelines that include, but are not limited to, protecting significant features of the natural environment, providing community open space, encouraging variety of housing types, encourage infill development and specify architectural standards and streetscape standards, including location of ingress and egress during construction and parking of construction vehicles; and planned traffic ingress and egress after building completion.
(3)
Guidance for multiple housing developments: review, evaluate, and advise developers on the appearance of developments that involve two or more homes that are built adjacent to one another to ensure that they each have a uniqueness that does not disrupt the eclectic housing outlook of the community.
