Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Part I of this volume is the Charter of the City, as adopted by 1991 Ga. Laws (Act No. 121), page 3935. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added for purposes of clarity. At the end of each section appears a historical note reference to amendatory Acts, if any. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the base act. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used.
