DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

Sec. 21-271. - Terms and definitions—Solar land uses.
For purposes of this article, certain terms and words related to solar land uses, and associated legal, scientific, technical, and general terms, are hereby defined, and shall have those meanings ascribed to them as provided herein. All other words and phrases shall assume their common, ordinary meaning, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, or a specific definition has been ascribed to them as provided within a separate section of this article.
( Ord. No. 557 , 7-9-15)
Sec. 21-272. - Categories of solar land uses.
The terms and definitions provided in this subsection refer to the types of principal and accessory solar land uses that are regulated by the provisions of this article. For purposes of categorizing and defining solar land uses, the terms herein may be considered "umbrella" in nature, meaning that they encompass a wide variety of utility scale solar collection, conversion and transmission systems for off-site power consumption as well as small-scale individual systems intended for on-site power consumption for uses such as a residence or business. Some of the terms provided in this subsection are augmented by supporting figures, and/or representative illustrations.
(1)
Solar energy system. A system capable of collecting and converting solar radiant energy (through direct, diffuse, and/or reflective collection) into heat, mechanical, or electrical energy and transfers the produced electricity in to a separate apparatus to store or to a point of use which include, but are not limited to, water heaters, interior space heaters or coolers, or electrical energy generation. Solar energy systems primarily consist of solar collection devices and mechanical equipment related to solar energy (transformers, inverters, etc.).
(2)
Solar energy system, principal (PSES). A solar energy system which is the principal or primary use on a single lot or parcel which is used to collect and convert solar energy into usable electricity using on-site equipment for the primary purpose of transmitting electricity off-site to be used by an electric utility. There systems include all uses defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under code 221114 which includes solar farms. (See Figures B.1 and B.2).
Figure B.1: A principal solar energy system may occupy an entire lot.
Figure B.2: A property owner may choose to subdivide their property and place a solar farm on one of the newly created lots thus creating a principal use for that lot.
(3)
Solar energy system, accessory (ASES). A solar energy system that is an accessory use to the principal use of a property, meaning it is incidental to the principal use and is subordinate in area or purpose. Accessory systems may be roof-mounted, ground-mounted or parking-mounted. (See Figures C.1 and C.2.)
Figure C.1: Accessory solar energy systems may include building-mounted and/or ground-mounted systems, as shown in this illustration. They may be allowed in front, side or rear yards, although some restrictions may apply.
Figure C.2: Accessory solar energy systems can also include parking-mounted systems, as illustrated above. An accessory system can include any combination of building-mounted, ground-mounted or parking-mounted systems, subject to additional conditions.
( Ord. No. 557 , 7-9-15)
Sec. 21-273. - Methods of collection.
Solar collection systems come in a variety of configurations, utilize variable technologies and materials, and incorporate interrelated structures and components, in order to actively collect, convert, and transmit solar radiant energy in a safe and efficient manner. The terms and definitions provided in this subsection represent some, but not all, of the solar collection structures and components related to the solar land uses regulated by the provisions of this article.
(1)
Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. A solar collection system which produces electricity by the use of photovoltaic cells which generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. A PV system may be roof-mounted or ground-mounted. Photovoltaic systems are generally comprised of the following components:
(2)
Solar thermal systems. A solar collection system which produces electricity by the use of photovoltaic cells which generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. A PV system may be roof-mounted or ground-mounted. Photovoltaic systems are generally composed of the following components:
a.
Flat plate collection. System which collects solar radiation to heat a liquid which in turn will be used to heat water or enclosed areas. This system generally contains a plate (panel) over tubes housed in a shell.
b.
Evacuated tube collection. System general composed of hollow tubes which contains a liquid used for the purpose of heating large volumes of water or heat water to a high temperature.
(3)
Concentrated solar systems. A solar collection system that uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight and create temperatures high enough to heat water or fluids to drive steam turbines that in turn create electricity:
a.
Parabolic trough. Curved mirrors are used to focus the sun's radiant energy onto a receiver tube that runs down the center of a trough. High temperature transfer fluid passes through a heat exchanger to heat water.
b.
Compact linear fresnel reflector. Similar to the parabolic trough, with the exception of long parallel rows of mirrors being used as a lower-cost option.
c.
Power tower. Structure where mirrors are used to focus the radiant energy of the sun on a receiver at the top of a tower to heat transfer fluid to produce steam.

Parking-mounted systems may cover any amount of parking spaces on a parcel but may not be installed in such a way that prevents the use of more than ten percent of existing spaces. (See Figures 2.4 D1 and D2.) A system mounted on top of a parking garage would be considered a building-mounted system. Such systems cannot impact the minimum number of parking spaces or the dimensions of parking spaces as required by City of Thomson Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.
