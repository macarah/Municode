(2)
Street names within new subdivisions shall be provided on the final plat map which shall be submitted to the office of the city manager and must be approved by the mayor and council prior to final plat processing.
(3)
For other new streets or naming of unnamed streets, the owner or owners of properties abutting the street may submit recommendations, in writing, for a name to the council member for that district or to the office of the city manager.
(b)
Guidelines for renaming streets.
(1)
Property owners abutting an existing street which has an existing name may petition the mayor and council for a name change.
(2)
Requests for street name changes shall require approval signatures of 90 percent of the property owners abutting the street and the payment of an applicable application fee, set by resolution of the mayor and council, and the applicant shall pay the cost of street sign replacement should a new name be approved.

(Ord. of 5-2-2023(1), § 1)
Sec. 26-185. - Addressing procedures.
modified
(a)
Address numbers.
(1)
Address numbers shall be clearly readable from the street and shall contrast with the background color.
(2)
If a structure is more than 75 feet from the street or is otherwise not clearly visible from the street, its address shall be posted at the driveway or the primary access to the residence from the public or private street. The address sign shall be no less than four feet or more than six feet above the ground on a substantial, maintained support structure. The view of the address from the street must be unobstructed.
(3)
All primary letters, numbers, and symbols, whether attached to a building structure or ground support structure, shall be a minimum of four inches in height, with one-half inch spacing between numbers, and shall be contrasting with the background color.
(4)
Property owners are responsible for displaying proper address number identification in accordance with this article.
(b)
Address number assignments. The following are basic standards for addressing:
(1)
The existing block structure will be followed. Distance between addresses is set at 20 feet for possible addresses. Numbers will be rounded to stay consistent.
(2)
All east-west street names and addressing shall begin at Hwy 25, all north-south street names and addressing shall begin at the Central of Georgia Railroad tracks. Streets that do not begin on Hwy 25 or the railroad tracks will stay consistent with surrounding block numbering and direction.
(3)
Even numbers shall appear on the South and East sides of streets and odd numbers on the North and West sides.
(4)
If a building (commercial, industrial, office, residential or combination thereof) has a number of entrances, each serving a separate occupant, individual addresses will be assigned to each entrance.
(5)
A building (commercial, industrial, office, residential or combination thereof) with one main entrance shall be assigned one number with the owner of the structure responsible for providing designated individual sub-unit numbering or alphabet designation.
(6)
Manufactured home parks shall have individual house numbers consistent with numbers 1, 2 and 3 above. Manufactured home parks shall have streets consistent with the city ordinances. Streets shall be named in accordance with city policies.
(7)
For multiple buildings in a development (commercial, industrial, office, residential or combination thereof), it may be appropriate to establish a private street centerline for addressing purposes. Buildings would then be addressed using the established street centerline in accordance with numbering procedures in this Ordinance.
(8)
A diagonal or meandering street shall be assigned numbers depending upon the quadrant and the address base line that it most favors.
(9)
Circle and loop street direction designations shall be determined by the road's predominate direction (N, S, E, W).
For circle streets, the numbering shall start at the intersection point of the road closest to the origination point and shall proceed in a clockwise direction using a consecutive numerical order with the odd/even numbers based on the starting point of the circle street as if the street were straight.
For loop streets, the beginning of the street is designated by the closest intersection to the origination point and increased numerically to that point that is farthest from the origination point.
(10)
Property parcels with structure(s), or bare land parcels which are accessed by a driveway shall be assigned an address at the point where the driveway intersects a named street.
(11)
For parcels that are accessed by multiple driveways, the owner shall designate a primary access point that will be used for address assignment. If this primary access point is not designated by the property owner, the E-911 director, or his or her designated officer, shall make the official determination to allow the proper addressing of the property.
(12)
Parcels served by a common driveway that accesses fewer than three parcels shall be assigned an address at the point where the access intersects a public or private street or named common driveway. Each property shall be assigned a different address.
(13)
In no case will addresses be issued to illegal structures or uses that are not properly permitted under the zoning ordinance.
For effective and efficient emergency service and enhanced 911, it is important to provide consistent and uniform addressing procedures throughout the county. In addition to the basic standards for addressing set forth in this article, the Jenkins County addressing guidelines to be adopted by resolution by the city council shall be followed to provide solutions to addressing situations that do not fall within the type of streets or scenarios that are provided in this article.

Historical impact.
(iii)
Humanitarian efforts.
(iv)
Significant lineage.
(v)

The application shall be submitted to the city manager for review. The city manager shall ensure that all criteria are met prior to submitting the application to the mayor and council for their consideration at their next regular meeting.
(3)
Approval of the application shall be in the sole discretion of the mayor and council. If final approval is given to the application by the mayor and council, the cost of the signs and any necessary mounting hardware shall be determined by the city manager and shall be paid by the applicant to the city prior to ordering the signs. The city manager, or his or her designee, shall then ensure that the honorary name signs are created and installed at the location approved by the mayor and council, generally at the point of beginning of the road and at the end of the road. Honorary designations shall be for the entire road.
(c)
Designation period. Honorary names shall be for a ten-year period but may be renewed if approved by the mayor and council. Applications for renewal shall be processed in the same manner as new requests, requiring a new application and administrative fee.

ARTICLE VIII. - REGULATION OF ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS

Sec. 26-200. - Findings and purpose.
The mayor and council of the City of Millen, Georgia ("city") find that carts commonly used at commercial stores for shopping are being abandoned on the streets and public rights-of-way of the city and that the abandonment of these carts creates an unsightly blight upon and diminishes the aesthetic appeal of the city. Furthermore, the subsequent removal of these carts requires the unnecessary expenditure of public resources and funds.
(Ord. of 2-2-2016(1))
Sec. 26-201. - Abandonment of carts prohibited.
A business utilizing carts, commonly known as "shopping carts," or "grocery carts" ("cart" or "carts"), in connection with its business is prohibited from allowing any person, persons or entities to remove the cart or carts from the property of the business resulting in the cart or carts being abandoned or left upon the streets, ditches, public rights-of-way, or upon any other public space, or upon the property of another without the property owner's express consent. Further, no person may remove a cart from the parking area of a business without the express permission of the business. Persons found to be in possession of a cart off the premises of the business owning the cart may be cited for violating the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 2-2-2016(1))
Sec. 26-202. - Retrieval by city and assessment of storage fee.
The carts of a business which are found upon the streets, ditches, public rights-of-way, or upon any other public space, or upon the property of another without the property owner's express consent shall be removed by employees of the city and stored at a central location. The city manager, or his or her designee, shall notify the business of the removal and storage, if the business can be identified from the appearance of the cart, through its owner or manager. The business shall be allowed to retrieve the cart upon payment of a retrieval and storage fee set periodically by the city manager, but which shall not exceed $100.00 per cart.
(Ord. of 2-2-2016(1))
Sec. 26-203. - Failure of owner to retrieve cart.
Upon the expiration of 30 days from the mailing of the notice in section 26-202, the city may dispose of the cart in any manner it deems practicable, including selling the carts to another person or entity. In the event of sale of the cart or carts, the funds shall be placed in the general account of the city for use by the city.
(Ord. of 2-2-2016(1))
Sec. 26-204. - Enforcement.
Violations of any provision of this article shall be charged by citation and penalized as provided in section 1-6 of this Code, provided, however, that no citation shall issue to a business if payment of the retrieval and storage fee is made as provided in section 26-202.
(Ord. of 2-2-2016(1))
