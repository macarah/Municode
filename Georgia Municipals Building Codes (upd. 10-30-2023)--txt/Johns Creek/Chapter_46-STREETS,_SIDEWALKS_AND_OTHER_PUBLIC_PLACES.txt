Permit.
(1)
A separate permit otherwise referred to as a right-of-way encroachment permit ("permit") shall be required for each proposed deployment, collocation, attachment or new installation location.
(2)
Permit applications must contain a demonstration that proposed facilities meet the following objective design guidelines:
a.
Intent and purpose. Small cell facilities in the public rights-of-way and utility poles installed or repurposed in the public rights-of-way for deployment of small cell facilities shall be designed in such a manner to maximize compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and to minimize any negative visual impact on the surrounding neighborhood. The objective design standards contained in this code section regulating the location context, color, stealth design, and concealment of the proposed small cell facility shall apply, unless a waiver of the objective design standards contained herein is approved by the Mayor and city council.
b.
Permittees shall not place or maintain signage on communications facilities, including small cell facilities or utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities, in public rights-of-way, unless otherwise required by federal or state law, provided; however, existing structures that lawfully supported signage before being repurposed may continue to support signage as otherwise permitted by law.
c.
A small cell facility shall not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by applicable codes, local codes or regulations, a permit issued by the city, or state and federal laws and regulations or as permitted by the city.
d.
A new small cell facility shall not be located within 300 feet of another small cell facility within the same right-of-way. Collocated communications facilities may be located as close as 150 feet to another small cell facility within the same right of way. Two or more facilities may be collocated on the same pole.
e.
Design and stealth design standards for new utility poles or replaced utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities. All proposed new or replaced utility poles for deployment of small cell facilities shall meet the design standards contained in this code section, or the license agreement and permit, unless waived by the mayor and city council.
1.
A replaced or restructured utility pole to accommodate the deployment of a small cell facility shall be in the same location as the original utility pole.
2.
The replaced or restructured utility pole shall be substantially similar in finish, base and pole design, diameter, material and height as the original pole being replaced, unless the city requires a different design, color or composition to be consistent with applicable city standards for new utility poles.
3.
The height for a new utility pole or replaced utility pole installed pursuant to this code section, and the license agreement and permit shall not exceed the height of the tallest existing utility pole, in the same right-of-way, measured from grade, in place within 500 feet of the proposed location of the small cell facility. If no utility pole exists within 500 feet in the same public right-of-way, the height shall be limited to 50 feet measured from grade. Height shall include only the height of the utility pole and shall not include any light, antennas, masts or other attachments to the utility pole.
4.
New utility poles shall be designed to be substantially similar in design to other utility poles in the same block or vicinity of the public rights-of-way. Such design aspects to follow include the material, base, pole diameter and style, location and style of attachments, finish, and cap, as applicable. By way of example, if existing utility poles in the same area of the public rights-of-way are light poles, the new utility pole should be designed substantially similar to such light poles and to the extent consistent with location context regulations, equidistant between existing poles. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any such stealth utility pole for deployment of a small cell facility shall function in the same manner as the facility it is intended to resemble in compliance with the City Code, at the expense of the permittee. By way of example, if a permittee installs a utility pole for deployment of a small cell facility to resemble a nearby light pole, the facility should include a light that is operated in the same manner as other light poles, at the applicant's expense unless and until ownership of such pole is transferred to the city.
5.
Notwithstanding this subsection, if the proposed location of a new utility pole for deployment of a small cell facility is within a public right-of-way that is within a particular special district, zoning district, planned unit development, community development district, community redevelopment agency, historic property, or a homeowners' association that has design standards applicable to utility poles, such proposed utility pole shall substantially comply with such design standards.
6.
If there are no existing utility poles in close proximity to a new utility pole for deployment to resemble or any applicable design standards based on the location, the new utility pole shall be designed to follow the city's design standards. The following required sections of the pole shall be consistent in proportion and detail with Johns Creek design standards:
A.
Powder coated bronze (TNEMEC 1075-D1421) and metal material;
B.
Non-ornamental base;
C.
Smooth tapered shaft, and;
D.
Non-ornamental capital, designed to conceal wires and equipment.
7.
This subsection does not authorize the installation of a new utility pole for deployment of a small cell facility in a location that is otherwise prohibited pursuant to court order or applicable codes.

(1)
Within 20 days of receipt of a written application, the city shall:
a.
Notify the applicant in writing of the commencement and completion dates of any widening, repair, reconstruction, or relocation of the applicable right of way that is scheduled to commence, or is anticipated in good faith to commence, within 24 months after the application is filed;
b.
Notify the applicant, based on the city's good faith preliminary review of the information provided in the application, of any aspect of the application that appears to be grounds for the city's denial of the application pursuant to this Code; and
c.
Determine whether the application is complete and inform the applicant of its determination in writing. If the city determines that an application is incomplete, it shall specifically identify to the applicant in writing all missing information within such 20-day period; otherwise the application is deemed complete. If the city identifies missing information to the applicant as provided in this paragraph, the applicant may submit such missing information to the city within 20 days of receipt of notification in writing from the city that the application is incomplete without paying any additional application fee, and any subsequent review of the application by the city for completeness shall be limited to the previously identified missing information. If the city determines that an application remains incomplete, or if the city determines that the applicant has made material changes to the application other than to address the missing information identified by the city, the city shall notify the applicant of such determination in writing within ten days of receipt of the resubmission of the written application, and absent an agreement to the contrary between the city and the applicant that is confirmed by email or other writing, such notice shall constitute a denial of the application. If the city does not provide such written notification to the applicant within this ten-day period, the application shall be deemed complete.
(2)
The city shall make its final decision to approve or deny the application within 30 days of the written determination that the application is complete or when the application is deemed complete under subsection (e)(1)c. of this code section, whichever is earlier, for a deployment, and within 70 days of the written determination that the application is complete or when the application is deemed complete under paragraph subsection (e)(1)c. of this code section, whichever is earlier, for the installation, modification, or replacement of a pole or decorative pole.
(3)
A decision to deny an application pursuant to this code section shall be in writing, shall identify all reasons for the denial, and shall identify the provisions of applicable codes or other standards applicable pursuant to this code section on which the denial was based. The decision to deny shall be sent to the applicant contemporaneously. The review period shall run until the written decision is delivered to the applicant.
(4)
If the city fails to act on an application within the review period provided for in subsection (e)(2) of this code section, the applicant may provide the city written notice that the time period for acting has lapsed, and the city shall then have 20 days after receipt of such notice to render its written decision. The application shall be deemed approved by passage of time and operation of law if the city does not render its written decision within such 20 days.
(5)
An applicant may, at the applicant's discretion and subject to the consolidated (batch) application requirements file a consolidated application. Applicants are discouraged from filing consolidated or batch applications, in that each deployment will be considered separately and approved or denied individually without regard for any interdependence. Additionally, the allowable review time for a mixed batch application is the longer of the multiple allowable time frames.
(6)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and to the extent that an application constitutes an eligible facilities request, the city shall not deny the application and shall approve the application within 60 days according to the procedures established under 47 C.F.R. 1.40001(c).
(f)

Beginning on July 1 of the calendar year following the date that the final adjudication is no longer subject to further appeal or to review by the United States Supreme Court, the monetary caps provided in subsections (f)(1)a. through (f)(1)e. of this code section for the fees or rates to which the determination applies, excluding any increases that have been made under subsection (f)(2) of this code section, shall double; and
b.
Beginning on July 1 of the second calendar year following the date that the final adjudication is no longer subject to further appeal or to review by the United States Supreme Court, the monetary caps in subsection (f)(1)(a) through (f)(1)(e) a., b., c., d. and e., of subsection 3) l) of this Code section for the fees or rates to which the determination applies shall terminate. In place of any monetary caps that terminate pursuant to this subsection, applicants shall pay fees or rates, as each may be applicable, that constitute the fair and reasonable compensation due to the authority under applicable law.
(4)
An applicant shall not be subject to any fees or rates other than those expressly provided for by this code section or as may be otherwise detailed in the voluntarily license agreement.

(1)
Ordinary maintenance and repair.
(2)
The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung between poles or support structures in the right of way in compliance with applicable codes; provided, however, that the city may require a wireless provider to obtain permits for any additional activities such as electrical work, excavation, or closure of sidewalks or vehicular lanes within the right of way if otherwise required by generally applicable law. Such permits shall be issued on a nondiscriminatory basis upon terms and conditions applied to any other person's similar activities in the right of way.
(i)
General relocation policy.
(1)
In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, and in the reasonable exercise of its police powers, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity may require adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities, and small cell facilities owned and maintained by wireless service providers. The city deems the right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way to be permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. thus, the cost of relocating a small cell facility installation when the city reasonably exercises its police power shall be borne by the wireless infrastructure provider. In such instances, the city shall work in good faith with the wireless providers to identify and provide suitable alternative locations for the placement of the removed wireless facilities if available and consistent with this code section.
(2)
Whenever the city determines that relocation of a small cell facility is necessary under this provision, the city shall give wireless service provider 60 days' notice within which to relocate or otherwise remove the small cell facility. Should the wireless infrastructure provider not relocate as directed by the city, the city may disconnect and remove the wireless attachment, ancillary equipment or the entire small wireless facility at the wireless infrastructure provider's expense. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and wireless service provider shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice. Failure to timely reimburse shall terminate right to be in the city's right-of-way.
(3)
Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the right to cut or move or disconnect any small wireless facility located within its rights-of-way as the city, in its sole discretion, may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider and provide it an opportunity to move its own small wireless facility, prior to the city cutting or removing such facility and the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider after cutting or removing the small wireless facility. The city shall not be liable for any damages to small wireless facilities or other infrastructure that is cut or removed during such emergencies. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and wireless service provider shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice.
(j)
Any company, partnership, association, corporate entity or individual ("cell company") seeking to install small cell facilities in the city, but not within the city's right-of-way shall comply with section 19.3.1.

Sec. 46-97. - Application review procedure.
(a)
Upon receipt of a complete application for permit, the city manager shall have it reviewed by the city departments, the services of which may be impacted by the event.
(b)
Upon receiving reports from the city departments, the city manager shall consider the impact of the event as whether it will unreasonably disrupt and obstruct the necessary flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic or endanger the public's health, safety, or welfare.
(c)
As part of the city manager's review, conditions may be made for alternate routes and locations of the event to ameliorate issues of traffic flow and public safety, which conditions shall attach to the permit, if issued.
(d)
The city manager shall also review an applicant's plans for:
(1)
Trash clean up and disposal provision;
(2)
First aid provision;
(3)
Vehicle and trailer storage provision; and
(4)
Toilet facilities available to participants.
If the city manager determines an applicant's plans presented for these services to be inadequate, the application may be denied.
(e)
Upon completion of the review of the application, the city manager shall issue a permit for the event, including its proposed routes of travel, if the city manager finds the event can occur without unreasonably impacting upon the use of the public streets, public property, and resources of the city and without endangering the public's health, safety, and welfare.
(f)
Any person whose application under this article is denied by the city manager may appeal such denial within three business days after the denial to the city council, which shall consider such appeal at the next regularly scheduled meeting following the filing of the appeal.
(g)
The city council in considering the appeal shall determine if good cause exists for denial of the permit and after hearing and receiving all evidence, shall either uphold the decision of the city manager or reverse the decision and grant a permit. In reversing, the city council may attach any requirements deemed necessary to the permit, as conditions to its issuance for protection of the public health and safety.
(h)
The city hall grounds may not be used for holding a parade, assembly, demonstration, or other event on any weekday prior to 8:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. or on any Sunday prior to 1:00 p.m. or after 5:00 p.m.
