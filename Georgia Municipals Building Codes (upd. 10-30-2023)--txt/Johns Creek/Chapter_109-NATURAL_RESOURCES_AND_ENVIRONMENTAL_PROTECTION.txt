Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-03-07, Exh. A, adopted March 16, 2015, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article II, §§ 109-19—109-25, pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

Sec. 109-19. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. Article IX, subsection II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, [the] City of Johns Creek, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Johns Creek, Georgia.
(c)
Designation of ordinance administrator. The director or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article.
(d)
Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto:
(1)
The flood insurance study (FIS) for Fulton County dated June, 18, 2010 with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto.
(2)
Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas including:
a.
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the city; and
b.
Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared by utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by the city.
c.
Base flood elevation data are required for all proposed subdivision and other developments greater than or equal to 50 lots or five acres within or adjacent to A-zones.
(3)
Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and floodprone areas including:
a.
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state, or federal agency applicable to the city; and
b.
Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology approved by the city.
(4)
The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at city hall.
(e)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(f)
Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.
(g)
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

(c)
General standards.
(1)
The following uses are permitted within the 100-year floodplain:
a.
Agriculture, including forestry and livestock raising, requiring no structure. Agriculture and forestry access roads are permitted provided they are constructed in conformance with the development regulations.
b.
Dams, provided that they are constructed in accordance with the requirement of this article, the United States Department of Agriculture Soil and Conservation Service and when applicable, meet the specifications of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
c.
Fences having sufficient open area to permit the free flow of water and/or debris.
d.
Identification, regulatory and warning signs.
e.
Public and private parks and recreational areas including boat ramps and docks and other functionally dependent uses not including temporary or permanent structures; provided, such use is approved by the department of community development and, if applicable, the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
f.
Parking.
g.
Utility lines, pipelines, sewers, roads and stream crossings (if no other means of access is available), and similar features, provided they are constructed in such a manner as to permit the free flow of waters.
(2)
No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions regulatory flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property; or
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(3)
Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection (2) above shall also meet the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
c.
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection (d);
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters;
f.
For residential lots, not less than 70 percent of the buildable land area must lie above the base flood elevation, a minimum of three feet, and/or not less than 50 percent of the minimum lot area must lie above the base flood elevation.
g.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy or completion can be issued.
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the city. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below.
(2)
Encrochments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the city.
(f)

The city board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this article. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(b)
The city board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the director in the enforcement or administration of this article. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
All decisions of the Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals regarding properties located within the city limits of the city prior to December 1, 2006 are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference. Such decisions of the county board of zoning appeals will have the same legal effect as if they were decisions of the city board of zoning appeals.
(e)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(f)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(g)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(h)
In reviewing such requests, the city and the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(i)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and,
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
(4)
The director shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(j)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city and board of zoning appeals shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request.
(k)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city and the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(l)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures.
(1)
Variances from the buffer and setback requirements in subsection (a) of this section may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
a.
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. Once established by the city council, the board of zoning appeals of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
b.
Except as provided above, and until such time as the city council establishes the board of zoning appeals, the city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council. Once established by the city council, the board of zoning appeals of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the board of zoning appeals. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
(2)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship.
(3)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
a.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
1.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
2.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
3.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
4.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; at least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
5.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; a stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
6.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
b.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
1.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
2.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
3.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
4.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
5.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
6.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

Sec. 109-119. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
modified
(a)
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. Additional standards which apply and will be enforced by Johns Creek are:
(1)
Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan: Requires a 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer and 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee and its impoundments and a 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer (all measured from the edge of the water) on perennial tributary streams in a Corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments. The corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton Counties). Streams in the basin of the corridor are required to be protected by buffers, but no required width is specified. (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.)
(2)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for Small (under 100 square miles) Water Supply Watersheds Authorized under Part V of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, these criteria require 100-foot undisturbed buffers and 150-foot setbacks on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake. Beyond seven miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet. Equivalent protection measures can be adopted with approval from Georgia DCA and DNR.
(3)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for River Protection Authorized under the 1991 Mountains and River Corridors Protection Act of 1991, these criteria require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cfs (excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced above). The buffer is measured from the top of the stream bank.
(4)
Other such state and federal regulations as may be adopted from time to time.
(b)
While the requirements of this article are intended to apply to all streams in the City of Johns Creek, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation. In addition, nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider buffers for purposes of protecting greenspace, preserving habitat or other goals that may not be specifically mandated by legislation.
(c)
Variance.
(1)
Variances consideration. Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing in December 1990 prevent land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements would create an extreme hardship. Hardships shall be evaluated in accordance with the following:
1.
If the applicant complies with the buffer widths and required practices, he or she cannot make reasonable use of his or her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance;
2.
The variance is the minimum possible deviation from the buffer widths that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;
3.
The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape, or topography, and the applicant did not cause the hardship;
4.
The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the DNR water supply watersheds;
5.
In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, and the quality of downstream water, including but not limited to water used to supply public drinking water, has been maintained or improved; and
6.
The applicant certifies that the applicant has not and does not intend to apply for a variance from the minimum buffer requirements contained in the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act for the same stream(s) for which a variance is sought pursuant to this section.
(2)
Variance procedure. At a minimum, variance applications shall include all the information required in section 109-118(b)(3)a. Variances shall be submitted and processed in accordance with section 22.13 of the zoning ordinance.
(3)
Mitigation. Mitigation measures are required to offset the effects of any proposed encroachment on the parcel.
(4)
Septic tanks. No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.

Sec. 109-151. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of BMPs shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the EPD director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by Johns Creek or of any state general permit issued by the division, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 Nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten Nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the EPD director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install or maintain BMPs shall constitute noncompliance with any land disturbing permit issued by Johns Creek or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. When such noncompliance is identified by the director of community development, official notice will be posted on that property.
(4)
The director EPD may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur as outlined by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System requirements.
(5)
The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
Rules and regulations governing land disturbing activities. The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and/or minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Proper erosion and sediment control measures must be installed along site boundaries prior to stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities as deemed by the director of community development to minimize erosion and prevent sediment from leaving the site.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to minimum erosion potential.
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented.
(5)
The disturbed area and duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect all exposed areas (especially steep cuts and/or banks, etc.) during development.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable.
(9)
Sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, sediment barriers, construction exits or similar BMPs as outlined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section, and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills.
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Migrated soil materials or soil materials displaced by mechanical means from land disturbing sites to adjacent water courses, such as lakes, ponds, streams and creeks, etc., must be remediated. The remedial work shall be conducted as per a remedial plan approved by Johns Creek.
(14)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of temporary or permanent bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, those such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(15)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section.
(16)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(17) and (c)(18) of this section, there is an established 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the EPD director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment where otherwise allowed by the EPD director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated is the project plans and specifications are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection.
b.
Temporary structural best management practices are required to be removed at the completion of project. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer way be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim underbrush in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(17)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and steams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions section 109-150(4), there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be conducted between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the EPD director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of this section and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the director of community development. The EPD director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(18)
There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
d.
Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.
(d)
Adoption of additional requirements. Nothing contained in this article and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
Injury to property not evidence of standards violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided in this article or terms of the permit.
(f)
Additional requirements. Where the director of community development finds, through inspection, that property owners have been adversely affected due to violations clearly identified by the director of community development, or that the approved current plans do not adequately address the features of the site, the director of community development can require additional BMPs, drawings and revisions to comply with the minimum requirements as outlined in this section.

Sec. 109-152. - Land disturbance application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the city that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, post-development stormwater management ordinance, development regulations, floodplain management/flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
Prior to any land-disturbing activity, the property in question must be part of an approved and recorded legal lot of record (exemption plat, minor plat, or final plat). Additionally, no land-disturbing activity, including grading, excavating, filling and/or foundation work, shall be conducted within the city, until a land-disturbance permit or a building permit (for those projects not requiring a land-disturbance permit under this article) shall have been issued by the director of community development allowing such activity, pursuant to the provisions herein provided. If a project is to be developed in phases, then a separate land disturbance permit or building permit is required for each phase not to exceed 25-acre increments and the development sequence should be followed on all projects issued a land disturbance permit.
(2)
No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Johns Creek without first obtaining a permit from the city department of community development or its successor to perform such activity.
(3)
All developments, construction, improvements, utilities and demolitions that occur within the boundaries of the incorporated limits of the city that disturb more than 5,000 square feet of land shall be required to submit an application for a land-disturbance permit.
(4)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of community development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed conforms to the provisions of subsections 109-151(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by seven copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans and a physical address of the property owner (post office box not acceptable). All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(5)
A minimum fee, as set by the Johns Creek City Council, shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, of the project area.
(6)
In addition to the city's permitting fees, fees also will be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(7)
The permit applicant shall be required to post a bond (surety) in the form of insurance bond, cash, or irrevocable letter of credit prior to issuing the permit. The bond amount shall be determined as established by the city department of community development, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, desilting detention ponds, water bodies, stormwater facilities, roadways, installing a fence with locking device, reestablishing damaged buffers and similar or related actions.
(8)
If a permit applicant has had two or more outstanding violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the city may deny the permit application.
(9)
If applicable, immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the city shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the city. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 109-151(c)(16) and (c)(17) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if Johns Creek and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(c)
Plan requirements.

A stand of historical significance.
d.
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
Tree bank means a site such as a school or public park where the owner/developer shall donate and plant the required trees when it is not feasible to plant the required trees within their site's project area.
Tree preservation ordinance means this article as approved and adopted by the city council of the City of Johns Creek to provide standards for the protection, preservation and replacement of trees regulated and enforced by the city arborist in conjunction with the department of community development or designated agent through development and construction permits and processes.
Tree save area means all areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees and/or preserving natural buffers.
Tributary means any perennial stream (or portion thereof) within the affected area that is portrayed as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 Quadrangle Maps, 1968 edition, or other perennial streams as identified by the City of Johns Creek.
