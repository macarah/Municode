(b)
No person shall ride a bicycle or propel roller skates, skateboards or other similar devices on sidewalks which are properly designated for pedestrians only.

When such signs are in place, no person shall disobey the signs.

(g)
A violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a violation of the Johns Creek City Code, enforceable by the city police department in accordance with section 54-2(c).
(h)
This article is not to be relied upon as a determination that riding a bicycle on public streets or public multi-use trails is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this section. All persons who ride a bicycle on public streets or public multi-use trails do so at their own risk and peril, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including motorists, other bicycles, and pedestrians. The city has no liability under any theory of liability and the city assumes no liability for permitting biking on public streets and public multi-use trails.
