CHAPTER 3. - PROCEDURES FOR SUBMISSION AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR PRELIMINARY PLANS AND PLATS

Section 3.0 - Preliminary Plat.
The Sole Commissioner of Pulaski County shall be the official platting authority. As the official platting authority, the Sole Commissioner of Pulaski County hereby delegates to the Enforcement Officer the power to approve or deny all preliminary plats in accordance with the standards set out in this Ordinance. The Enforcement Officer must first approve a preliminary plat for a subdivision prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit or initiation of any land-disturbing or construction activities.
Section 3.1 - Pre-Application Review.
Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider may, at his or her discretion, consult early and informally with the Enforcement Officer for advice and assistance. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. If the tract of land is not to be initially subdivided in its entirety, the subdivider should provide sketch plans for the entire tract and indicate the proposed unit divisions or staged development boundaries.
No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review, and no format application shall be required.
Section 3.2 - Procedure for Preliminary Plat Approval.
Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the subdivider shall submit to the Enforcement Officer a preliminary plat, prepared by either an engineer or surveyor licensed by the State of Georgia, of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedure:
Application for Preliminary Plat Approval: Following any pre-application review of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit a complete application requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat to the Enforcement Officer in accordance with the schedule published by the Sole County Commissioner. If the proposed subdivision includes or abuts on any part of the State Highway System, two (2) copies of the preliminary plat shall be forwarded by the Enforcement Officer to the appropriate office of the Georgia Department of Transportation for recommendation and approval as provided in O.C.G.A. ยง 32-6-151.
Not less than six (6) copies of the preliminary plat shall be submitted to the Enforcement Officer who shall distribute one (1) copy each to the County Road Superintendent and the County Health Officer. The Enforcement Officer shall retain the remaining copies of the preliminary plat for review.
Review of Preliminary Plat: The Enforcement Officer shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations set forth in this document. The County Health Officer shall review the proposed method of sewage disposal and water supply for the subdivision and express its written approval, disapproval, or approval subject to listed modifications to the Enforcement Officer. The County Health Officer has thirty (30) days following submission of the preliminary plat to notify the Enforcement Officer of its findings. If the County Health Officer has made no finding within the thirty (30) days, a statement must be provided to the Enforcement Officer from the County Health Officer as to why no action has been taken. The County Road Superintendent shall review the preliminary plat for compliance with all State and County regulations and express his or her written approval, disapproval, or approval subject to modifications to the Enforcement Officer. The County Road Superintendent must notify the Enforcement Officer of these findings within the thirty (30) days following submission of the preliminary plat or submit in writing to the Enforcement Officer his or her reasons for not being able to produce any finding.
Preliminary Approval: Following review of the preliminary plat and other related material, the Enforcement Officer may approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions within sixty (60) days of the submission of the preliminary plat. If the Enforcement Officer issues an approval or approval with conditions, a Certificate of Preliminary Approval will be issued noting the conditions of such approval on four (4) copies of the preliminary plat with one (1) copy being returned to the subdivider, one (1) copy to the County Health Officer, one (1) copy to the County Roads Superintendent, and one (1) copy to be added to the records of the Enforcement Officer. If review and approval was required by the GDOT, the Certificate of Preliminary Approval shall be noted on one (1) additional copy of the preliminary plant and shall be returned to the GDOT.
Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a Final Plat. It indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat. The subdivider is responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and any other requirements including those stated in any conditional approval. The Enforcement Officer shall not approve any preliminary plat that shows a lot or situation that would clearly require a variance in order to be reasonably usable.
Expiration of Time: If the Enforcement Officer takes no action within sixty (60) days of preliminary plat submission, then the preliminary plat is approved. In the event that the GDOT recommends rejection or it fails to act within thirty (30) days from submission, then the deadline for approval or disapproval of the plat by the Enforcement Officer shall be no more than five (5) working days after the receipt of the GDOT's action or the expiration of the thirty (30) days without action, whichever is later. Preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further effect twelve (12) months from the date of the preliminary approval unless the Enforcement Officer extends this deadline with due cause.
Disapproval: The Enforcement Officer may find reasons detrimental to the public safety, health, and general welfare, or in conflict with any adopted plans of Pulaski County, which would cause disapproval of the preliminary plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be made on four (4) copies of the preliminary plat with one (1) copy being returned to the subdivider, one (1) copy to the County Health Department, one (1) copy to the County Road Superintendent, and one (1) copy being added to the records of the Enforcement Officer. The applicant may reapply for preliminary plat approval in accordance with Section 3.7 herein.
