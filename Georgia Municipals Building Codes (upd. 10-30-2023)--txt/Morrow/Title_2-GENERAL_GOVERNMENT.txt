Rules of decorum. In legislative debate, the mayor and councilmembers shall, to the maximum extent possible, keep their remarks germane to the matter before the city council at that time. Councilmembers shall refrain from attacking the motives and character of the mayor or other councilmembers participating in a debate.
The mayor and all councilmembers must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. The presiding officer of the council, who shall be the mayor, or in his absence the mayor pro tempore, shall be responsible for maintaining the order and decorum of meetings. All remarks should be directed to the presiding officer and not to individual councilmembers, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate and may be ruled out of order. If the presiding officer fails to enforce order and decorum, another member may raise a point of order, obtain a second, and with support of the majority present, act to enforce said order and decorum.
(b)
Rules of order.
(1)
Councilmembers. Members of the city council desiring to speak shall first address the chair, gain recognition by the presiding officer, and confine himself or herself to the question under debate, avoiding personal attacks and indecorous language.
(2)
Limitation of debate.
a.
Under the "comments" section of the agenda, each councilmember shall confine his or her remarks to a total of three minutes.
b.
During other portions of the agenda, general debate, or debate on any particular agenda item, a councilmember shall confine his or her remarks to five minutes. After all who desire to speak on an item have spoken, members wishing to speak a second time shall be given two minutes by the presiding officer.
(3)
Interruptions. A councilmember, once recognized, shall not be interrupted when speaking except for a point of order and shall hold the floor until completion of his or her remarks or until the allotted time for speaking has elapsed.
(c)
Purpose. It is not the intent of this section to, in any way, hinder or impair the full and free expression of the competing viewpoints in city council debate. Instead, it is the intent of this section to foster citizen confidence in government through encouraging civil, respectful meetings. The failure to strictly observe these procedures shall not affect the jurisdiction of the city council or invalidate any action taken at a meeting that is otherwise held in conformity with law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the city council, by majority vote, may grant additional time as requested for comments by either party.
