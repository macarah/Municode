Section 907A - Community university planned district (C.U.P.D.).[2]
Purpose and intent: The purpose and intent of this article is to establish a uniform procedure for review and approval of projects; to protect, enhance, preserve or reuse places, sites, buildings, structures, objects, streets, street furniture, sidewalks, neighborhoods, and landscape features; provide for aesthetic, economic, and functional value of properties, neighborhoods, and structures; and to promote aesthetics of the built environment, business viability, neighborhood preservation and public safety in the City of Morrow Community University Planned District (CUPD).
The added purposes of this Community University Planned District allows developers the opportunity to maximize the building floor area on each lot, locate parking off the street frontage so that businesses can move close to the sidewalk and more readily attract pedestrians, place buildings at a minimal front setback line close behind a sidewalk of adequate width, encourage construction of at least three-story buildings, locate retail uses on the ground-floor street frontage preferably adjacent to other retail uses, locate on second and higher floors office, service, or residential uses that generate pedestrian traffic from the general public to utilize the continuity along the street frontage of retail uses, provide better access to the land areas remaining undeveloped or underdeveloped, develop sidewalks and building features (e.g., entrances, weather protection) so as to maximize safety, comfort, ease of movement, and convenience for pedestrians.
The scope of this zoning also includes standards for sidewalks; pedestrian and site lighting; street trees; site development; design, materials, location and orientation of buildings and accessory structures; landscaping; screening and material. These standards are necessary to implement the goals contained in the City of Morrow Livable Community Initiative Study. Such goals include, but are not limited to, implementing an integrated transportation and land use plan; creating a town center, applying design guidelines; improving traffic and the pedestrian environment, aesthetics of the built environment, and business viability; preserving neighborhoods and promoting public safety. Community University Planned District (CUPD) standards apply to all properties within the district for which initial development or redevelopment is taking place; provided that nothing in this article shall prohibit homeowners of existing single-family homes from improving their homes in accordance with traditional standards of the RS-80 District and city adopted codes of technical regulations. This proviso shall exempt from compliance, improvements to homes that would otherwise be affected by the 40 percent trigger of the review process below; provided further that any single-family home for which demolition of 50 percent or more of the existing home is sought, shall comply with the full terms of this article.
Studies and master plan. The City of Morrow received money from the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 2001 to study and design a pedestrian and transportation friendly town center. The Sizemore Floyd Company was hired to hold public hearings, develop community support, and to create a preliminary design plan that met the desires of the Morrow community and the smart growth concepts required for Metro Atlanta. The master design plans, visual aids, and model shall be used as a guide to create new development within the Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) area. Most of this area is commonly known as Gateway Village, but really represents the Community University Planned District (CUPD) in our comprehensive plans and land use maps. Should a concern relating to our intent for the CUPD district arise by developers, staff, or future Morrow leaders, the LCI study and findings shall offer visual and empirical data proving our community's intent and the ARC's approval of our plans.
Review process. Applications for improvements to developed sites and/or existing structures shall meet the standards contained in this article for installation of sidewalks, pedestrian lighting, and street trees, when the proposed interior and/or exterior renovation of a building and/or site redevelopment improvements have a declared value equal to or greater than 40 percent of the property's most recent tax assessment, building or expansion of floor space of an existing building.
Estimated costs of, including but not limited to, demolition, construction, installation, and fabrication, including labor and materials, for both interior and exterior improvements, shall be submitted at the time a building and/or land disturbance permit application is filed.
The declared value of improvements under multiple permits shall be cumulative and shall include the value of improvements under permits issued for the previous seven years, from the date the most recent application is filed.
All land disturbance permit applications for new construction shall meet the standards contained in the CUPD district.
All building permit applications for new buildings shall meet the standards contained in the CUPD district.
Where two or more properties, lots or parcels are located within the same block or have frontage on the same side of the street between two intersecting streets, and are under common zoning or ownership and are being developed or re-developed as a single development operation or a series of coordinated development operations, these properties shall be considered as a single property for purposes of this article.
When a portion of any parcel, lot, property, or development, falls within the boundary of the CUPD district, the entire development shall meet these standards.
Section 1. Purpose of district. The intent of the Community University Planned District (CUPD) is designed to create a site for mixed-use development that forms a new town center for the City of Morrow.

1.
More than one principal land use is proposed for development on a single parcel under single or multiple ownership.
2.
Exceptions or variations to the size, dimensional changes in standards required or other requirements of the zoning ordinance are being sought.
In order to qualify for a planned center zoning classification, a proposed planned center must first meet the following requirements:
1.
The proposed development must be compatible with land use existing in the district to which the -PC district is to be appended. For example, a residential planned center must be appended to a residential district, a commercial planned center must be appended for a commercial district, etc.
2.
The area proposed shall be in one ownership, or if in several ownerships, the application for amendment to the zoning ordinance shall be filed jointly by all of the owners of the properties included in the plan.
3.
A sketch plan of the proposed planned center shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning board. The sketch plan may be a free-hand sketch made on a plat showing topography, having contour intervals of ten feet or less. The sketch plan shall include all of the contiguous property under one ownership and shall contain the following information:
—
The planned center name;
—
The owner and designer of the planned center;
—
Date, scale and north arrow;
—
Proposed uses and the acreage in each proposed use;
—

4.
Subsequent to sketch plan approval, a formal development plan shall be prepared incorporating comments and modifications suggested by the planning and zoning board.
This plan shall be reviewed and a recommendation made to the city council by the planning and zoning board. Specifically, such plan shall include the following elements:
a.
A plot plan drawn to scale by a registered engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect or architect showing the exact dimensions of the parcel or parcels of land under consideration, and including the following:
—
A site plan drawn to scale (1" = 100' or 1" = 50') and indicating all property dimensions, platting and street systems, proposed building sites, plans for the protection of abutting properties, means of ingress and egress, access and circulation arrangements, off-street parking and loading facilities, proposed reservation or dedications for streets and other public facilities, and, if requested, two-foot vertical contour intervals. The site plan shall include the name of the development and the developers, a north point, the depth of field survey, tract boundary lines, dimensions, bearing, angles and reference points to at least two permanent monuments.
—
If the proposal includes the subdivision of land for any purpose or the provision of new streets, the information required above and any additional information required with the submittal of preliminary plats under the subdivision regulations of the City of Morrow, the site plan shall be processed simultaneously as a preliminary plat under the subdivision regulations of the City of Morrow, and as a part of the application for a planned center district classification as provided for in this ordinance.
b.
A written report shall be submitted by the applicant, reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning board and the city council, and such report shall explain the type, nature, intent and characteristics of the proposed development, and shall specifically include, where applicable:
—
A general description of the proposal;
—

—
Tabulations of the overall density for residential uses, if any, and other data that the planning and zoning board and the city council may require.
c.
The planning and zoning board may also request that the applicant have an environmental impact report prepared by a mutually agreed upon qualified professional. This report shall objectively discuss positive and negative impact of the proposed development on adjacent land uses, traffic patterns and volumes, vegetation and wildlife habitat and area aesthetics. An environmental impact report shall be mandatory if a proposed project generates 2,000 vehicle trips per day or adds at least 30,000 gallons per day to sewage treatment plant capacity.
Administrative procedures:
Any request to establish a -PC district shall be considered an amendment to the zoning ordinance and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established herein.
The proponents of the planned center shall begin construction exactly as proposed within two years of the recording of the amendments. If such construction is not commenced and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the city council may initiate action to abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of the actual development. It is intended that a planned center be designed to carry out the objectives of the planning practices established by this ordinance and to be so developed within a reasonable time.
It is recognized that changes in the detail of an originally proposed plan could occur. The planning and zoning board is therefore authorized to act on proposed changes from the original plan provided said changes do not materially affect the basic design or negate any special features which were designed to facilitate traffic or preserve neighborhood character. Written approval of the planning and zoning board shall be required for all changes made.

Section 914 - AG Agricultural district.
Purpose: This district is composed of certain lands and structures in the city presently having a predominately rural character and which will likely retain this rural character for an indeterminate period of time. Regulations in this district impose only minimum restrictions on the use of land for agricultural purposes, and these minimum regulations are intended primarily to protect nearby residential uses from possible objectionable effects of certain agricultural operations such as livestock raising, storage of fertilizer, or sawmill operations. Regulations relating to the operation of quarries are intended to ensure that these operations will not constitute a hazard to public safety and to encourage the quarrying of the property in such a manner that when quarry operations are completed, the land will be usable for other purposes such as private or public recreation areas, water storage or industry.
As the need and demand for additional open land suitable for urban development is determined by the planning commission [planning and zoning board], selected portions of this agricultural district may be rezoned for more intensive forms of development.
Permitted uses:
Single-family dwellings, including additional single-family units located on the same lot or parcel as the principal building on the basis of one single-family unit for each ten acres in addition to the lot area required for the principal residence. The additional units shall be subject to all of the yard requirements of this district.
Accessory uses:
Home occupations
Conditional uses:
Churches and other places of worship with attendant educational-recreational buildings. No church, synagogue, chapel, or other place of religious worship and instruction shall be located within 100 yards (300 feet) of any establishment that sells or offers to sell any distilled spirits in accordance with the licensure and permitting requirements of the state and the city.
Cemeteries, provided that the location of these uses shall be limited to any locations where they may best serve as a transitional open use between less compatible uses and to locations abutting state or federal highways.
Clubs, private and public, including golf and country clubs, fishing clubs, gun clubs and other similar enterprises.
Privately owned and operated recreational facility having an area of not less than 50 acres and containing recreational facilities open to the paying public. A comprehensive development plan for the entire area shall be submitted to the planning commission [planning and zoning board] in addition to specific plans for each of the commercial facilities to be developed.
Athletic fields or stadiums, racetracks and speedways, and recreation areas for public uses including golf driving ranges, swimming pools, fishing lakes and similar recreational uses when located on a tract of land not less than five acres.
Airplane landing fields and helicopter ports and accessory facilities for private or public use including flight strips.
Schools and publicly owned and operated community structures and lands.
Public utility structures and lands.
All conditional nonresidential uses in the agricultural district shall conform to the standards of performance described in the LM district and shall be so constructed, maintained and operated as to not be injurious or offensive to the occupants of adjacent premises by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dust or other particular matter, electrical disturbance, toxic or noxious waste material, odor, fire and explosive hazard or glare.
Space limits:
Minimum lot area: One acre.
Minimum lot width: 100 feet at the building line.
Minimum front yard: 50 feet.
Minimum rear yard: 40 feet.
Minimum side yard: 15 feet.
Maximum building height:

(Ord. No. 2013-48, § 3, 9-24-13)
Section 915 - Mixed use district (MU).[4]
Purpose and intent: The purpose and intent of this article is to establish a uniform procedure for review and approval of projects; to protect, enhance, preserve or reuse places, sites, buildings, structures, objects, streets, street furniture, sidewalks, neighborhoods, and landscape features; provide for aesthetic, economic, and functional value of properties, neighborhoods, and structures; and to promote aesthetics of the built environment, business viability, neighborhood preservation and public safety in the City of Morrow.
The added purposes of this mixed use district allows developers the opportunity to maximize the building floor area on each lot, locate parking off the street frontage so that businesses can move close to the sidewalk and more readily attract pedestrians, place buildings at a minimal front setback line close behind a sidewalk of adequate width, encourage construction of at least three-story buildings, locate retail uses on the ground-floor street frontage preferably adjacent to other retail uses, locate on second and higher floors office, service, or residential uses that generate pedestrian traffic from the general public to utilize the continuity along the street frontage of retail uses, provide better access to the land areas remaining undeveloped or underdeveloped, develop sidewalks and building features (e.g., entrances, weather protection) so as to maximize safety, comfort, ease of movement, and convenience for pedestrians.
The scope of this zoning also includes standards for sidewalks; pedestrian and site lighting; street trees; site development; design, materials, location and orientation of buildings and accessory structures; landscaping; screening and material. These standards are necessary to implement the goals contained in the City of Morrow Livable Community Initiative Study. Such goals include, but are not limited to, implementing an integrated transportation and land use plan; creating a town center, applying design guidelines; improving traffic and the pedestrian environment, aesthetics of the built environment, and business viability; preserving neighborhoods and promoting public safety. The mixed use district (MU) standards apply to all properties within the district for which initial development or redevelopment is taking place; provided that nothing in this article shall prohibit homeowners of existing single-family homes from improving their homes in accordance with traditional standards of the RS-80 District and city adopted codes of technical regulations. This proviso shall exempt from compliance, improvements to homes that would otherwise be affected by the 40 percent trigger of the review process below and further provided that any single-family home may be rebuilt following damage or destruction by fire or other natural causes without regard to the 50 percent limitation on demolition.
Review process. Applications for improvements to developed sites and/or existing structures shall meet the standards contained in this article for installation of sidewalks, pedestrian lighting, and street trees, when the proposed interior and/or exterior renovation of a building and/or site re-development improvements have a declared value equal to or greater than 40 percent of the property's most recent tax assessment, building or expansion of floor space of an existing building.
Estimated costs of, including but not limited to, demolition, construction, installation, and fabrication, including labor and materials, for both interior and exterior improvements, shall be submitted at the time a building and/or land disturbance permit application is filed.
The declared value of improvements under multiple permits shall be cumulative and shall include the value of improvements under permits issued for the previous seven years, from the date the most recent application is filed.

All building permit applications for new buildings shall meet the standards contained in the MU zoning classification.
Where two or more properties, lots or parcels are located within the same block or have frontage on the same side of the street between two intersecting streets, and are under common ownership and are being developed or re-developed as a single development operation or a series of coordinated development operations, these properties shall be considered as a single property for purposes of this article.
When a portion of any parcel, lot, property, or development, falls within the boundary of the MU district, the entire development shall meet these standards.
Streetscape Standards:
Street trees shall be:
1.
Centered two feet from the sidewalk between the sidewalk and back of curb on streets. Street trees may be placed adjacent to the sidewalk away from the street, if in conflict with utilities.
2.
A minimum four inch caliper.
4.
Planted at approximately 40 feet on center.
5.
Selected from the species listed in attachment.
6.
Of a single species on any single property, although other required trees on property need not be of a single species.
7.
Shall contribute towards the requirements of the Tree Preservation Ordinance.
Sidewalks:
1.
Sidewalk widths may be tapered between streetscape types.
2.
Sidewalk paths shall be continued across the entire length of all concrete aprons and shall be textured to match the appearance of sidewalk materials, in color, texture and design.
3.
Where rights-of-way are insufficient to accommodate the required sidewalk and planted strip, the streetscape may be located outside the right-of-way.
4.
Where the front setback for a new building is not an exception, a sidewalk 15 feet in depth shall extend from the eight foot grass strip to the building face. Street trees may be planted in the portion of the sidewalk area nearer the street curb. This sidewalk requirement also shall apply to an addition to an existing building except for alteration of existing front parking or where the space between the existing front building face and a line 15 feet behind the curb is landscaped or improved for pedestrian use.
Weather protection. Awnings or canopies are not required, but any awnings and canopies approved by the city council may extend over sidewalks (public or private), to protect patrons and to facilitate movement of pedestrians from building to building in inclement weather. Supporting structure for such awnings or canopies shall not block any portion of a public sidewalk. Awnings and canopies and any signs suspended from them shall clear the sidewalk by at least eight feet.
Pedestrian circulation requirements. Substitute or alternative pedestrian routes through or between buildings for part or all of the requirements in this chapter may be authorized by special administrative permit, upon a finding by the city council that: (i) such pedestrian ways are not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter; and (ii) such pedestrian ways provide equal or improved pedestrian circulation. That portion of the pedestrian circulation requirement of this chapter which lies within the net lot area shall constitute a corresponding portion of the open space requirements.
Development pattern and land access. As development and redevelopment occur, a pattern of a sidewalk (15 feet) on each side, with any utilities so located that tree-planting wells may be placed in that portion of the sidewalk nearer the curb, and marked pedestrian crossings, including curb "bump-outs" at all intersections and midblock pedestrian crossings. This pattern shall be designed to permit safe, low-speed circulation of cars and pedestrians throughout the area, provide for the creation of small lots and buildings, and facilitate placement of additional buildings at the sidewalks of such additional streets. Other street configurations may be considered, subject to a determination that the purposes and provisions of this overlay district are satisfied to a reasonable degree.
Pedestrian lighting:
1.
Pedestrian lighting shall be installed when new or upgraded sidewalks are constructed.
2.
Pedestrian lighting shall be spaced 60 feet apart and shall be equal distance from required street trees, in accordance with the Georgia Power Area-wide Pedestrian Lighting Plan.
3.
Fixtures design shall be approved by the Morrow Public Works Director.
4.
On intra-parcel sidewalks, fixtures shall be installed to maintain a minimum lighting level on the pathway of six foot-candles.
Site Development Standards:
Intra-parcel walkways. A continuous, on-site intra-parcel walkway of at least five feet in width is required to connect the public sidewalk to the main entrance(s) of that property's building(s), and shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), in all respects. Intra-parcel walkways crossing parking lots shall be distinguished from parking lots by the use of colors, texture (use of different materials), difference in rise above the parking lot or a combination of these means, to minimize auto-pedestrian conflict.
Landscape strips and planting materials:
1.
There shall be a ten foot wide landscape strip adjacent to the edge of the sidewalk.
a.
Strip between street and sidewalk—Material and width. Two-foot wide brick paver, eight-foot wide planted strip (groundcovers, grass).
b.
Sidewalks—Required in all districts. Width of sidewalk—Fifteen feet.
2.
Ground covers and mulch or similar materials, shall be utilized in parking lot landscape islands. Turf grass is permitted with an expectable landscape and irrigation plan.
Buffers. A 40-foot natural or enhanced buffer with an eight-foot City of Morrow approved masonary wall shall remain between all MU zoning classification developments and any remaining RS-80 single family residential zoned property as defined by the Future land Use Map designed in April 2004. A MU development that abuts an RS-80 community, but is divided by a road, shall use the public right-of-way for their side of the roadway as the starting point and move back 40 feet to meet the buffer requirement. The city council may require additional plantings, enhancements, walkways, paths, lighting, or other community functional needs to incorporate the MU development into the adjacent residential community.
Accessory structures and screening:
1.
Accessory structures shall not be located in any yard adjacent to a public street or viewable to the general public.
2.
Loading docks, refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, exterior work areas, mechanical equipment or other utilities if visible from a public street shall be screened from public view by one or a combination of the following elements: continuous evergreen plantings, opaque approved fences or other material related to the primary landscape or architectural elements on the site.
3.
When plantings are used as screens, such plantings shall be evergreen. Such plantings shall count toward required minimum landscape areas rather than being in addition thereto.
4.
Where walls or approved fences are used in lieu of planted screens, landscape materials shall be incorporated into the screening scheme whenever feasible.
5.
Where a parking lot, parking structure or gas fueling bays front directly on a public street, a continuous screen of evergreen (to be equally effective all year) planting shall be provided. Said screen shall be a minimum height of two feet, a maximum height of three feet, and minimum width of five feet. Such planting shall contribute to the minimum landscape areas.
Fences and walls. The following standards apply to common fences and walls around businesses, residential developments, and detached and attached residential subdivisions along public street frontages. The following standards are in addition to the standards set forth in the regulations, fences and walls.
1.
Allowable materials include: natural and man-made stone, brick, ornamental decorative or wrought iron or aluminum, or architectural concrete.
2.
Fencing made of barbed wire, razor wire, plastic, cloth, wood, or chain-link is prohibited,

4.
When the back of the building is visible to a public street, fences or walls shall be opaque.
5.
Application for fence and wall permits shall be approved by the city manager.
Parking. The City of Morrow strongly encourages structured parking in the MU zoning classification. Existing surface parking exceeds the needs of the community and reduces our ability to create a pedestrian friendly environment for our guests, corporations, and residents.
Front parking. No parking, driveway, or other area for vehicles shall be placed between the building and the street.
Existing parking in front of buildings. Upon adding floor space to a lot with an existing building, where parking requirements are otherwise met, existing parking in front of buildings shall be replaced by uses such as
1.
Expansion of the existing building, including a one-story expansion such as a porch,
2.
Outdoor seating for serving food or beverages, or
3.
A pedestrian courtyard.
Bicycle parking: A minimum of one bicycle parking space shall be provided for every 20 auto spaces.
Off-site parking. Where alternative off-site parking (either public parking or private parking obtained by lease or easement) is provided within 200 feet of the property, the on-site parking requirement may be reduced to as little as zero, provided that the total of on-site and alternative off-site parking together shall meet the requirement for the proposed use and
a.
The building meets the requirements regarding number of stories or
b.
The use of existing floor space is proposed to be altered in a manner that requires more parking spaces (e.g., an existing space is being changed from office to retail use, or a restaurant is expanding the number of seats).
The availability of alternative off-site parking for a particular development shall be determined based on
1.
The total number of off-site parking spaces that will be available by the time of occupancy of the new floor space,
2.
The cumulative amount of new floor space for which the off-site parking spaces are counted in meeting the parking requirement, and
3.
The maximum number of such off-site parking spaces likely to be utilized at any one time by the cumulative new floor space.
Parking ratios. The number of parking spaces provided for a site shall meet but shall not exceed the number calculated from the parking ratios required by the Zoning Ordinance, unless such higher number is justified to and approved by the city council. For a building of three or more stories, floor area lost to stairwells and elevator shafts shall not be included in total floor area for parking calculations.
Minimum number, maximum number. The following are the minimum and maximum number of off-street parking spaces and loading stalls required by type of permitted uses in the Mixed Use Classification (MU). Twenty percent of the total required parking spaces may be set aside for compact and sub-compact cars. For any use not listed the city council shall determine the proper requirements by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein so as to assure equal treatment follows the principles set forth. In making any such determination, the city council shall follow the principles set forth at the beginning of this article.

In no case shall the front setback specified for the underlying zoning district take precedence. Exceptions to the aforesaid front setback are where a pedestrian courtyard (including outdoor seating for a business serving food or beverages) is created behind the sidewalk, in which case a building that abuts the courtyard may be set immediately behind it, where a building must be set back from the street to a location where the property is wider, because the street frontage is too narrow for the building, or where an addition to an existing building is at such a substantial distance from the aforesaid setback line or so located that it is determined that it can not reasonably be extended to that line (e.g., an addition to an existing building set well back on a shopping center property).
Building setbacks. Building setbacks in yards adjacent to public streets may be increased to a maximum of 35 feet to accommodate outdoor space needed for plazas, dining, art, fountains, bicycle parking, gathering and seating places, gazebos or similar uses.

Section 916 - RS-30 Fee simple town houses district.
Intent. It shall be the intent of this zoning district to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities are flexible in design. The city gains the advantage of variety in building types, compatibility of use and optimum community development. The fee simple town house zoning is intended to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning and to assure the provision of parks and recreation land and facilities for the use of the occupants of the development. Review of the development plan by the planning and zoning board and approval by the city council is required to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
Ownership control. All of the land in a fee simple town house development shall be owned initially by an individual, by a corporation or some other legal entity. Individual properties may be sold after a final plat has been recorded with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the fee simple town house development as originally approved and developed.
General deed covenants. The entire fee simple town house development shall be included within private deed covenants running with the land to assure the continuance of the planned residential development in accordance with approved plans and development.
Homeowners associations and maintenance agreements: All residential developments created after January 1, 2000, are required to have a homeowners association and current maintenance agreements.
