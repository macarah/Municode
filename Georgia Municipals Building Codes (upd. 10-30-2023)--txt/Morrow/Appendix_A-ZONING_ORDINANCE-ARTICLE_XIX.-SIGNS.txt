Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-04 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted April 10, 2018, amended Art. XIX in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XIX, §§ 1901—1926, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2016-04, § 1(Exh. A), adopted May 24, 2016.

Section 1901 - Findings of fact and purpose.
(a)
The City of Morrow finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises.
(b)
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's residents and business community
(c)
As a result of the city's regulation of signs beginning in 1974, commercial areas of the city present an aesthetically pleasing environment which supports and promotes robust business activity within the city as well as providing a zone for traffic substantially free of unsafe diversions.
(d)
The city's intention in enacting sign legislation has never been directed at nor enforced against the content of the signs, but has rather focused on the physical characteristics of the sign structures.
(e)
The purposes of this article are to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication within the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this article. In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the city, the mayor and council have considered planning studies, reports, news articles and related information from a variety of sources.
(f)
Signs provide an important medium through which individuals, organizations, institutions, and businesses may exercise their right to freedom of speech and expression and convey a variety of constitutionally protected messages.
(g)
The provisions in this article which regulate signs on the basis of size, height, shape, design, spacing, placement, and distance, but not on the content of any constitutionally protected message conveyed therein, provide an appropriate balance between the right of freedom of speech and expression via the sign medium and the protection of the substantial governmental purposes stated above.

The notice shall provide a reasonable time within which to accomplish such removal, but generally no more than 30 days. Failure of the owner or other responsible person to remove or repair the sign in accordance with the notice shall result in issuing of a citation to the owner and placing the case on the municipal court docket for hearing as a nuisance, provided that where a sign is dilapidated to such an extent that the safety of the public is endangered thereby, the city manager is authorized to secure or remove the sign so as to alleviate the hazard to the public.
