(b)
Consistency matrix and comprehensive plan text. In making decisions as to whether a rezoning application is consistent with the comprehensive plan, the director shall determine whether the property to be rezoned is consistent with the character map and consistent with the future land use map, based on the following consistency matrix, as well as, the policies and principles of the text of the comprehensive plan. Such additional considerations may include the policies for the character area in which the private property is located, principles for ensuring consistency with the adopted character maps, descriptions of land use categories, general land use policies, and land use policies for specific types of land uses.

Property with more than one character area or future land use designation. Any rezoning application for property that is designated as being in more than one character area, or in more than one future land use category (i.e., split between two or more designations), shall be considered inconsistent with the character map and future land use map if the rezoning application is inconsistent with any one of the character areas or any one of the future land use categories the subject property is designated.
