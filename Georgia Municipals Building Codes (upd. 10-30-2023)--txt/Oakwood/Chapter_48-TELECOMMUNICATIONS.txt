(Ord. No. 316, § 2, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 48-78. - Purpose.
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunication providers and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunication facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety, property values and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunication carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive municipality in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this article shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunication facilities in the city;
(2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunication facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunication towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; and
(6)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Ord. No. 316, § 1, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 48-79. - Exclusions.
The following shall be exempt from this article:
(1)
Any tower and antenna under 70 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the FCC; and
(2)
Any present or future telecommunications facilities used for private or public purposes and located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city; provided a license or lease authorizing the telecommunications facility has been approved or will be approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 316, § 3, 6-14-1999)
Sec. 48-80. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district.

Micro telecommunication facilities shall be allowed in all zoning districts as a use by right following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official.
(b)
The placement and installation of all other telecommunications facilities shall be restricted to the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts and shall be subject to city council approval.

Sec. 48-81. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred location sites.
(1)
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting and/or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the administrator or the city council to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, antennas should be less noticeable when affixed to utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges and flag poles than when placed on commercial or residential structures.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any residential structure or site shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. No. 316, § 5, 6-14-1999)

General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
(1)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of such a facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building and safety codes for telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time.
(2)
Regulatory compliance. All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, to the extent required by any such regulations, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, the FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. Any required lighting shall be restricted to dual lights (medium intensity white strobe lights daylight mode and red obstruction lights nighttime mode) unless the FAA or state aeronautics division requires some other form of lighting.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely comparable with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the equipment shelters or cabinets from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The city council may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms, or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the city.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
All property necessary to satisfy setback requirements covering the total height of the tower shall be under the ownership or control of the applicant. The requirement for control may be satisfied by lease or easement approved by the local governing authority. Multiple towers on the same site are permitted provided they meet all setback and separation requirements. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers:
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from any adjacent property line, as measured radially from the base of the tower to the property line of the subject property.
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for buildings.
b.
The city commission may approve a reduction in any of the required setbacks based on a finding that the adjacent land, including its future development pursuant to its zoning designation at the time of the application, will not be impacted in an adverse manner. The criteria used to determine those impacts are those set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers.
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(4)
With the exception of those towers to be located on the same parcel of property, towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable or if the tower has insufficient antennas mounting space or insufficient structural capacity to accommodate co-location.
(5)
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the city council or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(6)
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing such as a chainlink fence not less than six feet in height.
(7)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. The clustering of new towers on the same parcel near existing telecommunications facilities is encouraged.
(8)
Towers shall be located in a manner such that all ice-fall or debris from the tower structure or guy wires will not fall outside the parcel under the ownership or control of the applicant and on which the tower is located.
