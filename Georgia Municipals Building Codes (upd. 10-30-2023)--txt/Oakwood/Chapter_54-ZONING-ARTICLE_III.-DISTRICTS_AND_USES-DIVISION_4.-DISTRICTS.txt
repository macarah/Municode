The City of Oakwood finds that the size, scale and character of multi-family residential uses directly affects adjacent land uses and the public health, safety and welfare. The City finds that highway oriented multi-family residential uses are incompatible with single family neighborhoods and are inconsistent with the needs of the City. The City desires to be an oasis with a small town feel with open space protected from unregulated growth and density. The City desires to be a diverse community that is an open walking community that interacts person to person. The City strives to have governmental services open to all supported by fair taxes balanced between residential, commercial and industrial. The City wants to keep its trees and green spaces and attract others who are concerned about our environment, our water and our air - all for our public safety, health and welfare. Thus, the purpose and intent of the R-4 Residential District set forth in Exhibit "A" is to: (1) Provide for multi-family residential housing types that are compatible with single-family neighborhoods and commercial nodes; (2) Encourage the development of multi-family housing with limited neighborhood serving commercial uses; (3) Improve the aesthetics of the built environment; (4) Protect existing stable single-family neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with their scale, character and needs and (5) Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the plaiting of trees and greenspace protection.
