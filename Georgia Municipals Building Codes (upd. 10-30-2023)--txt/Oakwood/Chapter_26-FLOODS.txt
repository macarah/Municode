(Ord. No. 432, art. 2, § 201, 8-14-2006; Ord. No. 2015-CO-02-726, § I(1), § 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 2018-CO-02-756, § 1, 3-12-2018; Ord. No. 2018-CO-10-774, § 1, 11-12-2018; Ord. No. 2022-CO-12-850, §§ 1, 2, 1-10-2023)
Sec. 26-2. - Findings.
(a)
The city finds that floodplain management involves the designation of floodprone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. The city further finds that floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality.
(b)
Specifically, the city finds the following:
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and economical purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(3)
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
a.
Protect human life and health;
b.
Minimize damage to private property;
c.
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
d.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4)
It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(5)
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. Section 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Oakwood, Georgia does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. No. 432, art. 1, § 101(a), 8-14-2006; Ord. No. 2018-CO-02-756, § 2, 3-12-2018)
Sec. 26-3. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

Sec. 26-67. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments.
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(Ord. No. 432, art. 4, § 404, 8-14-2006; Ord. No. 2015-CO-02-726, § I(5), § 3-9-2015)
Sec. 26-68. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the city.
(Ord. No. 432, art. 4, § 405, 8-14-2006; Ord. No. 2015-CO-02-726, § I(5), § 3-9-2015)
Sec. 26-69. - Maintenance requirements.
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The city may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.

ARTICLE V. - VARIANCES

Sec. 26-133. - Variance procedures.
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Hall County, as provided by law.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the city manager and the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
i.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
ii.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
iii.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
d.
The city manager shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city manager and city council shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city manager and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city manager and the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
