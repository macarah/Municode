(Ord. No. 433, Â§ 701, 11-14-2005)
Sec. 40-21. - Findings.
(a)
The city council does hereby determine that:
(1)
Land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition;
(2)
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased non-point source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(3)
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(4)
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or credits. The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas that provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
(5)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution.
(b)
Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion and non-point source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(Ord. No. 433, Â§ 101(a), 11-14-2005)
Sec. 40-22. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable;
(6)
Coordinate site design plans that include greenspace with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(7)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and
(8)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and long-term follow up.
