In the event that the official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the Mayor and City Council may by zoning ordinance adopt a new official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior official Zoning Map, and shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted the date of March 21, 2006 as part of the Chamblee Zoning Ordinance."

The Planning and Development Director is the final authority in determining the current zoning status of land, buildings and structures in the city.
(b)
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of any zoning district boundaries as shown on the official Zoning Maps, the following rules apply:

Where possible, a rezoning file shall be used for delineating zoning boundaries. Such records shall have precedence over information otherwise contained on maps.
(2)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines.
(3)
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, each portion shall be governed by the zoning district that each portion is classified.
(4)
Where areas appear to be unclassified on the Zoning Maps, and classification cannot be established by the above rules and there is no other evidence of its existing or past classification, such areas must be considered to be classified NR-1 until action is taken by the Mayor and City Council to amend the Zoning Maps.
(c)
Where uncertainties continue to exist or further interpretation is required beyond that presented in the above subsections, the question shall be presented to the Mayor and City Council to enact a clarifying ordinance and Mayor and City Council's action shall be recorded on the Zoning Maps.
