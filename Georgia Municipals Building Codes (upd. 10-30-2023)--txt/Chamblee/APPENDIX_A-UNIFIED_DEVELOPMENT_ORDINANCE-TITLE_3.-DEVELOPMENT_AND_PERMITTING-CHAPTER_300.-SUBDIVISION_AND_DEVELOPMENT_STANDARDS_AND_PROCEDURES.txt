CHAPTER 300. - SUBDIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL

Section 300-1. - Authority and purpose.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this Title of the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) is to establish procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of land which facilitates the creation of functional neighborhoods enhancing the quality of life for the immediate residents, adjoining neighborhoods, and the City as a whole. This Title aims to achieve the following:
(1)
Orderly growth and development of new and redeveloped neighborhoods;
(2)
Coordination of streets within proposed neighborhoods with existing or planned streets and other public facilities;
(3)
General distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding;
(4)
Dedication or reservation of parks, squares, and recreational areas, accessible to all residents to serve as community focal points;
(5)
Set standards for landscaping and detailing of the public domain of streets, parks, and squares to promote a pedestrian oriented atmosphere and civic awareness; and to
(6)
Provide for pleasing visual environments to ensure public health, safety and the general welfare to residents of the City.
(b)
This Title is designed to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewer, stormwater management facilities; for the dedication of rights-of-way or easements for streets and utility purposes; to ensure the proximity of residential areas to centers of employment and shopping; to facilitate the further subdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land; and to provide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better identification and permanent location of real property boundaries.
(c)
This Title is also designed to protect and enhance the quality of the natural environment of the City by encouraging the preservation and protection of significant existing trees (in accordance with the City Tree Preservation and Replacement Regulations, Chapter 320, Article 4); assisting in the natural control of solar heat; reducing the impact of development on the community's storm drainage system; assisting in soil conservation and flood control; reduction of air emissions and noise; conserving the City's water supply; and enhancing the visual and aesthetic appearance of the community.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)

When through lots are required for residential subdivisions abutting boulevards, primary or secondary streets a vehicular no-access easement of at least ten feet in width shall be required abutting the back of curb of such thoroughfare, across which there shall be no right of access except approved bicycle or pedestrian pathways. The vehicular no-access easement may be incorporated into the design of the required sidewalk zone and/or landscape zone for the streetscape or landscape strip along such major thoroughfare. See Section 320-22 for landscaping requirements of vehicular no-access easements.
(e)
The Planning and Development Director may approve an unbuildable lot of record in a proposed subdivision only for the following purposes:
(1)
No lot shall be reduced in size so that minimum lot width or depth, size of yards, or any other lot requirement is not maintained. This limitation shall not apply when a portion of a lot has been lawfully acquired for public purpose or for unbuildable lots used exclusively for subdivision identification signage or subdivision entrance landscape features or stormwater facilities.
(2)
To provide a location for a ground sign permitted in Chapter 260.
(3)
To provide a location for a stormwater management facility as provided in Section 340-39, Post-Development Stormwater Management Performance Criteria.

Section 300-13. - Reserved.
Section 300-14. - Conservation subdivisions.
(a)
Purposes.
(1)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
(2)
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(3)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(4)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(5)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
(6)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
(7)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
(8)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
(9)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
(10)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
(11)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(12)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
(b)
General regulations.
(1)
Applicability of regulations. This conservation subdivision option shall be limited to the NR-1 zoning district. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except for minimum lot size. Minimum lot size may be reduced, provided that all minimum setback and building spacing requirements are met, without the need for a variance.
(2)
Minimum subdivision size. Conservation subdivisions shall be a minimum of five acres in area.
(3)
Reserved.
(4)
Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided shall be held in single and separate ownership. If it is to be sold in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(5)
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the Planning and Development Director or his/her designee:
a.
Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
1.
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
2.
The 100-year floodplain;
3.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; or
4.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
b.
Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations pertinent to a conventional subdivision. When using this method, the developer is entitled to achieve a yield that is equivalent to that shown on the yield plan multiplied by the factor of 1.2, provided all setback regulations are met or appropriate variances are obtained.
(c)
Application requirements.
(1)
Site analysis map required. Concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan, the applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this article. The preliminary site plan shall include the following features:
a.
Property boundaries;
b.
