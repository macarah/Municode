DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 78-36. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
City manager means the City Manager of the City of Chamblee, Georgia. The city manager may delegate his authority or be assisted by other employees as required.
Event means any parade, public assemblage, or special event as defined within this article.
Organization or group of private persons means a group of three or more persons, or their representatives, acting as a unit.
Parade means a group or number of people or vehicles, or the combination thereof, consisting of ten or more vehicles, 20 or more persons, five or more vehicles and ten or more persons, or a combination of three or more vehicles and five or more persons, proceeding or moving in a body or in concert along the streets or sidewalks of the city. Specifically excepted from this definition are funeral processions.
Producer means any person responsible for planning, producing and conducting an event. An event permit shall be issued only to an individual person. Therefore, if a group, organization, association, or other entity is producing the event, a designated producer shall be named for purposes of the permit, and this individual shall be solely and fully responsible for compliance with all provisions, including all financial requirements of this article and other applicable laws.
Public assemblage means any march, demonstration, picket line, procession, motorcade, rally, or gathering for a common purpose, consisting of persons, animals, or vehicles or a combination thereof upon or in the streets, parks, or other public grounds within the city that interferes with or has a tendency to interfere with the normal flow or regulation of vehicular traffic or that endangers or has the reasonable possibility of endangering the public's health, safety, or welfare.
Special event means a gathering of people, generally lasting from a few hours to a few days, designed for entertainment, recreation, and/or education. Special events either affect the ordinary use of parks, public streets, rights-of-way, or sidewalks, disrupt the flow of traffic on public streets or sidewalks, or include alcohol service or sales where it is not normally permitted. Common special events in Chamblee are 5K races and festivals. Filming by a film production company does not require an event permit but does require a film production permit which is handled by a separate process in chapter 35.
Vendor means any person or persons or entity who engages in the sale to the public of any food or food products, goods, services, or merchandise of whatever nature from any location, either mobile or stationary, on a temporary itinerant basis on any public street, sidewalk, or right-of-way as an authorized participant of a permitted event.
