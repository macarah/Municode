If such sanitary billing remains unpaid, the tax commissioner or authorized designee, shall have the authority to issue a fi fa or execution against the property served, which fi fa or execution shall have the same lien dignity and priority as fi fa's or executions issued for city taxes. Each annual installment shall become a lien against the property served on January 1 of each year in the same manner that a lien attaches for city taxes, and such lien shall cover the property of the owner until such billing for sanitary services is paid. Any sanitary billing amount that remains unpaid shall accrue penalty, interest and fi fa charges in the same manner and at the same rate as delinquent city taxes.

The city shall provide material relating to the education and marketing efforts of the infrastructure maintenance fee as well as provide education and training to licensee's employees to ensure consistent message is conveyed to constituents of the city. For purposes of verifying the amount of such fee, the books of the licensee shall at all reasonable times be subject to inspection by the duly authorized representatives of the city.
(c)
Credit for fees/taxes paid. If any licensee is also subject to the payment of occupation taxes to the city, said taxes shall serve as a credit to reduce the infrastructure maintenance fee, which reduction shall be calculated at the time of the May 20, quarterly payment. Credit shall also be given at that time for the license fee paid under this article.
(d)
Licensees shall, from time to time, provide the city with the necessary statistics regarding solid waste collected and disposed which shall allow the city to comply with state reporting requirements. Such information shall be in the manner and format requested by the city and provide adequate details for the city to maintain compliance with local, state, federal and all other guidelines relating to solid waste collection, removal and disposal.
