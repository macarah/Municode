Editor's note— Ord. No. 2012-002, § 1(exh. A), adopted Sept. 4, 2012, amended Art. VI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, §§ 46-125—46-129, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 4-5-2011, §§ 1—3(exh. A).

Sec. 46-125. - Purpose.
Neighborhoods are facing significant threat of becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are abandoned, foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure. Improperly maintained and secured abandoned and/or foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of abandoned and/or foreclosed real property. There is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article.
This foreclosure registry will require creditors or mortgagees to provide the county with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing abandoned and/or foreclosed real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Chapter 14—Buildings and Building Regulations, Chapter 42—Natural Resources, Chapter 46—Nuisances and Chapter 58—Solid Waste of the Code of Morgan County, Georgia.
