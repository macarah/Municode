(b)
In addition to any punishment for violating this chapter, any such violation may subject a licensee to the revocation or suspension of his or her license, as set forth in sections 6-301 and 6-302.
(1)
Any revocation or suspension based upon a violation of this chapter will subject the licensee to a reinstatement fee between $500.00 and $1,000.00, to be determined in the discretion of the board.

This reinstatement fee is non-refundable and must be paid prior to the reinstatement of any license issued under this chapter.
b.
No new license shall be issued to a licensee whose previous license was revoked or suspended until the reinstatement fee is paid.
