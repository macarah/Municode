(e)
Budget required. Any agency, authority or entity requesting part of its operating funds from the county, as precondition of approval, will be required to submit a budget showing the relationship of county funds to relevant line items of the recipient's budget and agree to submit to audit by outside independent auditors approved or provided by the county. Submission of a budget by constitutional officers and audit of the budget does not submit any constitutional officer's budget allocation to county control or direction. The audit report shall examine the actual use of county funds as compared to the uses as proposed by the requesting agency or entity. Where the county's participation is less than $5,000.00 the board of commissioners may agree to substitute internal audit by county personnel for outside auditors.
(f)
Appropriations. No expenditures shall be legal or proper unless appropriations adequate to meet that expenditure have been made in the budget.
(g)
Expenditures. No expenditure of county funds from whatever source may be made for a nonpublic purpose.
(h)
Appropriation increases. Any increase in appropriation in a departmental expense category, whether accomplished through change in anticipated revenues or through a transfer of appropriations among departments or nondepartmental expense, shall require the approval by resolution of the board of commissioners. The transfer of appropriations among the various line items of a departmental budget or nondepartmental expense shall require only the approval of the county manager. However, no transfer within a departmental budget affecting the salary appropriation, whether increase or decrease, shall be accomplished without approval of the board of commissioners. This subsection is inapplicable to constitutional officers.
(i)
Appropriation transfers. No appropriation transfer from a sinking fund or debt retirement fund shall be made until all legal obligations and requirements of such funds have been satisfied.
(j)
Unobligated appropriations. All appropriations which are not obligated at the end of the fiscal year shall lapse and shall become a part of the planned and unencumbered surplus which may be appropriated for the next fiscal year.

ARTICLE VI. - ACCOUNTING

Sec. 66-120. - Accounts.
(a)
The following funds may be established and shall be used as necessary to provide the proper accounting of all financial activities of this county:
(1)
General fund: to account for the general government operations and all financial transactions not properly accounted for in another fund.
(2)
Special revenue funds: to account for the proceeds of special revenue sources, other than special assessment, or to finance specified activities as required by law or administrative regulation.
(3)
Debt service funds: to account for the payment of interest and principal on longterm debt other than special assessment and revenue bonds.
(4)
Fixed assets and capital projects: to account for the receipt and disbursement of monies, including bond funds, used for acquisition of equipment or capital facilities other than those financed by special assessment and enterprise funds.
(5)
Enterprise utility funds: to account for the financing of services to the general public where all or most of the costs involved are paid in the form of charges by users of such services.
(6)
Trust and agency funds: to account for assets held by a governmental unit as trustee or agent for individuals, private organizations, and other governmental units.
(7)
Intergovernmental service funds: to account for the financing of special activities and services performed by a designated organizational unit within the same governmental jurisdiction.
(8)
Special assessment funds: to account for special assessments levied to finance public improvements or services deemed to benefit the properties against which the assessments are levied.
(b)
A complete self-balancing group of accounts shall be established and maintained for each fund used. This group of accounts shall include all general ledger accounts and subsidiary records necessary to reflect compliance with legal provisions, and to set forth the financial position and the results of financial operations of the fund. In order to reflect the true fiscal position of each account and to prove compliance with legal provisions each fund should be self-balancing. This means that the double-entry system of bookkeeping should be used. For each account debited, there is an offsetting credit and vice-versa. The total of the credits and debits must equal each other. The double-entry system provides a basis for checking the accuracy of the information recorded to the accounts.
(c)
Additional accounts, as follows, may be maintained:
(1)
A fixed assets account for the purpose of accounting for those assets which:
a.
Are of a tangible nature;
b.
Have a life longer than three years; and
c.
Have a value greater than $5,000.00.
Fixed assets shall be removed from the account when disposed of. In order to be recorded as a fixed asset, the item must meet these three criteria.
(2)
A general longterm debt account for the purpose of accounting for longterm debt which is supported by general revenues, and for recording and fairly representing the liability for longterm debt at any time from date of issuance until the debt is retired.
(d)
To the extent possible, the modified accrual basis of accounting shall be used so that expenditures, other than accrued interest on longterm debt, are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred and revenues are recorded when cash is received, except for material or available revenues which shall be accrued to reflect properly the taxes levied and the revenues earned. All receipts and disbursements shall be posted promptly and at least on a monthly basis. To the extent possible, all interfund transfers shall be cleared by the end of the fiscal year.
(e)
Comprehensive annual financial report.
(1)
Financial statements and reports showing the current conditions of budgetary accounts shall be prepared and presented to the board of commissioners at least every three months. Not later than three months after the close of the fiscal year, a comprehensive annual financial report covering all funds and financial operations shall be prepared and published.
(2)
A summary of this report, containing at least a statement of revenues and expenditures as of the close of the preceding fiscal year and the combined balance sheet for all funds and account groups, will be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
(f)
All the funds, accounts and financial transactions of the county shall be subjected to an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant who is to be selected by the board. The audit shall be conducted according to the standards set forth in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants publication titled Audits of State and Local Governmental Units.
