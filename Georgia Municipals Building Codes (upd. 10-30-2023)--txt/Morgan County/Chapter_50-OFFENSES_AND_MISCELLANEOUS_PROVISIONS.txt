--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-001, § 1(exh. A), adopted May 19, 2015, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 50-11.1—50-11.8. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 50-21—50-28.

Sec. 50-21. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to encourage alarm users and alarm companies to properly use and maintain alarm systems and to reduce or eliminate false alarms, which unduly divert emergency services from responding to actual emergencies.
(Ord. No. 2015-001, § 1(exh. A), 5-19-2015)
Sec. 50-22. - Applicability.
This article governs fire, medical and security alarm systems intended to summon emergency response from emergency medical, fire department or law enforcement and provides for civil penalties for malfunctions and violations.
(Ord. No. 2015-001, § 1(exh. A), 5-19-2015)
Sec. 50-23. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alarm company means any entity that sells, leases, maintains, services, repairs, alters, replaces, moves, installs or monitors alarm systems in Morgan County.
Alarm system means any system, device or mechanism intended to detect and signal the occurrence of activity requiring the immediate need for emergency services at the premises at which such device or set of devices is installed.
Alarm user means any individual or entity, who owns or leases an alarm system or on whose premises an alarm system exists.
Cancellation means the process whereby an alarm company terminates the need for an emergency response by notifying the emergency communications center after an alarm dispatch request.
Duress alarm means a silent alarm system signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a life-threatening situation or crime in progress requiring law enforcement response.
Emergency response means sheriff's department, fire rescue or emergency medical services response.
False alarm means the activation of an alarm system to summon emergency personnel which occurs as a result of mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, unless the request for response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before the sheriff's department, fire rescue or emergency medical services arrives at the alarm site. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, sheriff's department, fire rescue, or emergency medical services personnel find no evidence indicating a need for an emergency response, such as: unauthorized entry, robbery, other such crime was committed, attempted, or occurred in or on the premises, which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system; or a fire having occurred which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system; or a medical emergency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm, which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by violent conditions of nature, nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user or alarm system. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system and the alarm company upon receiving such permission does not request emergency dispatch.
Local alarm means an alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site that is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is not monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an alarm company or user.
Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting the sheriff's department, fire rescue or emergency medical services for dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this section, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting emergency dispatch.
(Ord. No. 2015-001, § 1(exh. A), 5-19-2015)

(2)
