ARTICLE III. - ROADS AND SIDEWALKS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 105-296. - Subdivisions; streets.
(a)
Classification of proposed streets. Prior to submission of preliminary plat, the developer shall meet with the city manager and his designee to have the proposed street classified, in order that it can be accepted into the city's system. In some cases, it may be desirable for a street to have a higher classification based upon ultimate development of the entire area, which is not necessarily just the one development being submitted. This is particularly true in the more outlying areas around the city. Street continuity may require that a cul-de-sac street be provided in a current development at the property line, such that it can be extended in the future. In a case of this nature, the current development would provide the street to the property line. The future development would pick up at the property line and continue the street.
(b)
Existing streets. When development is proposed on an existing street, all improvements required under these standards shall apply to the side of the street which the development abuts.
(c)
Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system shall extend existing streets, but to current city standards. If lots front on the existing city street, it shall be improved out to an acceptable city or county road by the developer.
(d)
Alleys. Alleys may be provided to the rear of all lots except lots with double frontage.
(e)
Restriction of access. When a subdivision fronts on an arterial or major collector, double frontage lots shall be provided with frontage on an interior street with no access to the arterial or major collector.
(f)
Dead end streets. All dead end streets shall have a cul-de-sac as defined in the City of Emerson Standard Details.
(g)
Conformity to the city street classification map. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform as specified. Street plans and profiles shall be approved by the city.

(2)
No intersection shall be at an angle of less than 75 degrees.
(3)
The property line at street corners shall be mitered adequately to permit construction of a 13-foot clear shoulder behind the curb and gutter.
(4)
Sight distance at intersections shall meet requirements of this regulation. (See City of Emerson Standard Details.)
(5)
Islands at intersections shall be subject to individual approval by the city. In no case shall anything extend more than two feet above the back of the curb within the right-of-way of the street to be intersected.
(6)
Landings shall be required for all intersections. These landings shall be as defined in the City of Emerson Standard Details.
(7)
Opposing tee street intersections shall be directly aligned or shall be offset at least 200 feet.

No proposed street name shall duplicate an existing street name within the city or the county regardless of the use of the suffix "Street," "Avenue," "Boulevard," "Drive," "Place," "Way," "Court," or however otherwise designated.
(3)
All street names are subject to the approval of the city.
(j)
Traffic studies. The city may require that a traffic study be performed prior to the issuance of any permits to evaluate the current capacity of streets expected to carry the traffic volumes from the proposed development.
