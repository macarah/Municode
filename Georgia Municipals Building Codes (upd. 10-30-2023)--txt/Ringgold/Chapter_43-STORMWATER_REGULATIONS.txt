Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2015-0126, adopted Jan. 26, 2015, repealed former ch. 43, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former ch. 43, §§ 43-1—43-10 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2007-0123, § I, adopted Jan. 23, 2007.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 43-1. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter:

Sec. 43-26. - Water quality.
All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and
(3)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.

Sec. 43-27. - Stream channel protection.
Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
(2)
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(Ord. No. 2015-0126, § 1, 1-26-15)
Sec. 43-28. - Overbank flooding protection.
Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under section 43-27 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
Sec. 43-29. - Extreme flooding protection.
Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.

For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(Ord. No. 2015-0126, § 1, 1-26-15)
Sec. 43-31. - Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures.
The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 43-26. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(Ord. No. 2015-0126, § 1, 1-26-15)
Sec. 43-32. - Drainage system guidelines.
