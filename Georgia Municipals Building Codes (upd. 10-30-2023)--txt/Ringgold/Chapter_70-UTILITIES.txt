Sec. 70-1. - Removal, relocation of utility facilities.
(a)
Any utility using or occupying any part of a city street, easement or other property owned by the city which the city has undertaken to improve or intends to improve shall remove and relocate its facility when, in the reasonable opinion of the city, the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the use or safe operation of such street, easement or property by the traveling public or when, in the reasonable opinion of the city, the facility will interfere with the contemplated construction or maintenance.
(b)
Whenever the city and councilmembers reasonably determine it is necessary to have a utility removed and relocated, the city shall give to the utility at least 60 days' written notice directing the removal and relocation of such utility obstruction. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the city may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from the receipt of such final notice. If such utility does not, within ten days of receipt of such final notice, begin to remove or relocate the facility or, having so begun removal or relocation, thereafter fails to complete the removal or relocation within a reasonable time, the city may remove or relocate the same with its own employees and do whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation. Unless the state department of transportation agrees to pay for the removal or relocation pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 32-6-173, the utility will be responsible for the expense. A statement of such expense shall be submitted to the utility, which shall make payment to the city within 60 days after the receipt of the statement. If the utility does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the city within 60 days, the city manager shall certify the amount for collection and take appropriate action to collect the indebtedness from the utility.
(c)
Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive any utility, relocated from a location in which it owned a property interest, of compensation for such property interest.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 70-58. - Statement of findings.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the storm sewer system of the city that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(2)
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the storm sewer system of the city from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(3)
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically disbursed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the storm sewer system of the city;
(6)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city;
(7)
Therefore, the city must adopt this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the storm sewer system of the city is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(Ord. No. 06-0213-02, § 1(70-48), 2-13-06)
Sec. 70-59. - Statement of policy and intent.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law.
(b)
This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the storm sewer system of the city in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Regulate the contribution to the storm sewer system of the city by any person;
(2)
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the storm sewer system of the city;
(3)
Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the storm sewer system of the city; and
