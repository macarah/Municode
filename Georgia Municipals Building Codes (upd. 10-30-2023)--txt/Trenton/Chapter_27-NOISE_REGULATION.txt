Sec. 27-2. - Sound level limitations.
(a)
No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any sound source in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound level limits set forth in Table 1, when measured at or within the real property line of the receiving property using the slow response setting unless otherwise noted.

Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and as necessary at other conditions including, but not limited to, design maximum and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made at or within the property line of the impacted site, unless otherwise directed in this chapter. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purpose of this chapter, noise measurements are measurements measured on the A- or C-weighted sound scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established by ANSI.

The sound level meter and calibrator must be re-certified annually at a laboratory approved by the noise control administrator. A field check of meter calibration and batteries must be conducted before and after every set of measurements, and at least every hour as necessary.
(c)
Total and neighborhood residual sound level measurements shall be taken in accordance with procedures established and approved by the noise control administrator. Calculation of source sound levels shall conform to accepted practice established by ANSI.
