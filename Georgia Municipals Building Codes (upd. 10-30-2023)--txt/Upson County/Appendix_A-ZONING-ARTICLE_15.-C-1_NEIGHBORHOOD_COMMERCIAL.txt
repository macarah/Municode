Cross reference— Businesses, ch. 26.

Section 1501. - Purpose.
C-1 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve small business areas of a limited nature that serve primarily the residential neighborhood in which they are located. Development standards for C-1 districts are designed to promote compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhood.
Section 1502. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a C-1 district.
The factors contained in section 410 of this ordinance must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Upson County.
Section 1503. - Boundaries of C-1 districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all C-1 districts within Upson County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
