ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 78-306. - Suitability of land.
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion or that is, due to topographical or other reasons, unsuitable for development shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or property destruction, unless hazards can be and are corrected.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-1, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-307. - Name of subdivision.
The name of the subdivision must have approval of the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-2, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-308. - Access.
Access to every subdivision shall be provided over a public street, and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street or a private street meeting the standards of a public street and approved.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-3, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-309. - Conformance to adopted comprehensive plan.
Proposed subdivisions shall conform to the adopted comprehensive land use plan of the county and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission. When features of the adopted comprehensive plan, such as schools or other public places including sites, parks, major streets, or other land for public uses, are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-4, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-310. - Reservation or dedication of public use areas.
(a)
Reservation of plan features. Where the features of the comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces, are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider; provided, however, that no more than ten percent of the total area of the subdivision shall be required for reservation to fulfill the requirements of this section. Whenever the land required for such plan features is not purchased, acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a two-year period from the date of recording the subdivision or by the time that at least 75 percent of the lots are built on and occupied, whichever is sooner, the subdivider may claim the original reservation and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider, subject to this chapter. Whenever a public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release, stating that the reserved land is not to be acquired, the planning commission shall waive the reservation requirements.
(b)
Reservation omissions. The planning commission shall not approve any plats of a subdivision when such planned features, as specified by the comprehensive land use plan, are not incorporated into the plat, and the reservation requirements for such features have not been waived.
(c)
Unnecessary or unsuitable reservations. Whenever the planning commission finds that proposed reservation of land or dedication of land for public use is not required or suitable for such public use, it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-5, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-311. - Large-scale developments.
A comprehensive group development, including large-scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission, although the design of the project does not include standard streets, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from this chapter can be made without destroying its intent. The developers of such proposals are urged to consult early with the planning commission to coordinate, plan, and plat properly.
(Ord. No. 134, § 5-6, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-312. - Community assets.
In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees and watercourses and for historical spots and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property.

Sec. 78-370. - Development along major arterial limited access highway or railroad right-of-way.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major arterial highway, a limited access highway, or a railroad right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access or at a suitable distance for an appropriate use of the intervening land, with double fronting lots, reverse frontage, and a nonaccess reservation suitably planted, if applicable. In such cases due regard should be given to requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances, and lots should have access only from the access street.

Sec. 78-371. - Intersections.
The centerlines of no more than two streets in a subdivision shall intersect at any one point.

Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments in a subdivision, but shall not be provided in one- and two-family residential developments unless the alley or service drive is to provide secondary access to a lot whose natural grade is more than six feet above the finished street grade (see section 78-468) or unless the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for an alley or service drive.
(Ord. No. 134, § 6-111, 5-11-2000)
Sec. 78-378. - Marginal access streets.
Marginal access streets are streets which are constructed so as to provide secondary access only. No more than six lots may abut any such street in a subdivision, and no such street may exceed 1,000 feet in length. Such streets may not be used as through streets and should be permitted only when lots abut an arterial or collector street.

Sec. 78-419. - Frontage arrangements.
The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each lot with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to an approved street contained within the proposed subdivision. Each lot must front for at least 30 feet upon an approved street or road. See section 78-421 pertaining to panhandle or flag lots.
(Ord. No. 134, § 6-33, 5-11-2000)

Sec. 78-421. - Panhandle or flag lots.
Panhandle or flag lots, of required width and area, will be allowable in a subdivision where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 30 feet wide, and the panhandle access shall not be more than 500 feet long.

Such easements shall not be less than 12 feet in width and, where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines.
(2)
Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision.
