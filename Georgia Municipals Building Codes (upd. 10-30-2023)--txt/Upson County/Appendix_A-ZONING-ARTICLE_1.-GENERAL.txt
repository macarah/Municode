ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL

Section 101. - Short title.
This document is entitled "the Zoning Ordinance of Upson County, Georgia." It may also be known by and cited by the short title of "Upson County Zoning Ordinance."
Section 102. - Authority.
Counties of the State of Georgia are authorized by the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, article 9, section 2, paragraph 4 [Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ IV], and chapter 66 of title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, to exercise the powers of planning and zoning; and it is hereby determined by the board of commissioners of Upson County, Georgia, that it is necessary and desirable to adopt these zoning regulations under the authority of the above-cited constitutional and statutory provisions.
Section 103. - Jurisdiction.
This ordinance applies to all land within the unincorporated areas of Upson County, Georgia, and within the limits of any inactive municipality in accordance with chapter 70 of title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
Section 104. - Purposes.
A.
The zoning ordinance of Upson County, Georgia seeks to encourage the development of desirable land use patterns within Upson County in accordance with the Upson County Land Use Plan (where one exists). The promotion of sound land use patterns is intended to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of certain conditions that can threaten the general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Upson County. This ordinance should serve the following purposes:
1.
Reduce the occurrence of hazardous traffic patterns and general congestion.
2.
Secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers.
3.
Assure that adequate light and air are provided.
4.
Prevent the overcrowding of land and undue concentration of population.
5.
Facilitate the adequate provision of public utilities and facilities.
6.
Promote adequate living conditions and sustained suitability of neighborhoods.
7.
Protect property against blight and depreciation.
B.
Additional benefits to the public interest that can accrue from the development of sound land use patterns are as follows:
1.
Efficient development and use of community utility networks.
2.
Economy in governmental expenditures.
3.
A higher level of convenience, order, prosperity, and aesthetics.
C.
While the Upson County Zoning Ordinance must be enforced fairly and uniformly, there are certain circumstances where special considerations need to be factors in Upson County's land use policy-making and implementation. The federal Fair Housing Act of 1988 makes it unlawful to refuse to make "reasonable accommodation" (modifications or exceptions) to rules, policies, practices or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. Reasonable accommodation considerations may require Upson County to look at the purpose and intent of certain of its land use regulations from a different perspective in specific cases.
