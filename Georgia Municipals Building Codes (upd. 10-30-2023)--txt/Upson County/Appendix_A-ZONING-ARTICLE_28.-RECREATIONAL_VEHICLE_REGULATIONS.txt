ARTICLE 28. - RECREATIONAL VEHICLE REGULATIONS
DIVISION 1. - IN GENERAL

Section 2801. - Purpose and intent.
It is the intent of this section to more fully detail Upson County's recreational vehicle/travel trailer/motor home regulations as described elsewhere in the zoning ordinance and in certain zoning districts. It is Upson County policy that recreational vehicles shall not be considered equivalent to nor be permitted as permanent residential structures. Permanent residential structures are built to meet either State of Georgia/International Code Council (ICC) Building Codes or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) standards. Recreational vehicles are intended for short-term vacation stays, itinerant travel, temporary emergency shelter, special circumstances housing and the like.
Specific, existing, recreational vehicles and recreational vehicle facilities are designated as legal non-conforming uses (grandfathered-in) for certain specified portions of these standards.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2802. - Permitted locations and requirements.
Each zoning district contains language that indicates the level and type of recreational vehicle use that may be employed in that district. Special overarching land use provisions may also be developed to address the appropriate use, placement and density of recreational vehicles.
A.
Recreational vehicles stored outdoors or in accessory structures on residential lots must be stored in conformance with the accessory structure requirements of the respective zoning district. In those instances where the rear yard is not accessible by means of a driveway, alley or has insufficient side yard clearance for the passage of a recreational vehicle, the recreational vehicle may be parked in the front yard. Recreational vehicles shall not be required to be towed or placed over any in-service septic tank or drain field. In those instances where a recreational vehicle is to be parked or stored in the front yard, the recreational vehicle shall be parked proximate to the side property lines, but no closer than five feet from the property line. Such recreational vehicles must remain unoccupied, except as indicated in other parts of the Upson County Zoning Ordinance.
B.
Recreational vehicles must be currently registered and tagged, having the official, current license plate mounted in the appropriate location on the vehicle.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2803. - Prohibitions.
Recreational vehicles are not permitted as permanent residences in any zoning district. Legally stored recreational vehicles shall not be used for living, sleeping or housekeeping purposes. Recreational vehicles shall not be used as storage sheds.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2804. - Special circumstances.
Pursuant to language found in each zoning district's requirements, recreational vehicles may be permitted as temporary residences for limited periods of time in those zoning districts under special circumstances. Those special circumstances primarily include temporary accommodation for medical issues, emergency circumstances and temporary housing during residential construction. Language found in the zoning district sections of the zoning ordinance provides more details on approval processes and conditions of approval for such temporary arrangements.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2805. - Recreational vehicles as short-term guest housing.
As described in this section, recreational vehicles are permitted as short-term guest quarters in zoning districts permitting single-family-residential units. Recreational vehicles that are owned by non-Upson County residents, guests or visitors and are registered and tagged from outside the county, may be parked or occupied by such guests or visitors on property on which a permanent, occupied dwelling unit is located for a total cumulative period not to exceed 30 days per calendar year while visiting the resident of such property. Any individual or family remaining for 16—30 days shall register with the Upson County Building and Zoning Department. This cumulative total period may include visits by a single guest or multiple guests over the period, but no more than one recreational vehicle at a time. The recreational vehicles shall have self-contained sanitary facilities.
Such recreational vehicles may be parked in the front yard. No portion of a recreational vehicle may extend over, or interfere with, the use of any sidewalk or right-of-way intended for pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2806. - Short-term recreational vehicle residence.
In addition to emergency and special exception situations, short-term residence is permitted in recreational vehicles in recreational vehicle parks. Such short-term residence may not exceed 12 months in a 24-month period anywhere in Upson County and must be solely for short-term work or business purposes, as verified, in writing, by a local business or employer.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2807. - Short-term recreational vehicle residence permit.
Such short-term residential recreational vehicles and their occupants must obtain a short-term recreational vehicle residence permit, which shall not be valid for more than six months, but may be renewed for not more than one additional six-month period. The short-term recreational vehicle residence permit application must be accompanied by a letter from the employer, naming the employee and explaining the short-term job/employment. Fees may be assessed as set by the board of commissioners. All short-term residential recreational vehicles must be legally registered and tagged. They may only be parked in a space where there is a direct sanitary disposal connection. The recreational vehicles must be maintained in good aesthetic appearance and function and be kept road-worthy. No structures such as porches, storage space, additional rooms, permanent stairs or the like, may be attached to the recreational vehicles.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2808. - Recreational vehicles as emergency shelter.
Recreational vehicles may be used as short-term residences during governmentally-declared natural and man-made disasters. The 12-month maximum duration for short-term recreational vehicle residence may be waived for specified amounts of time by the Upson County Board of Commissioners. All recreational vehicles used for bona fide emergency shelter, due to natural or man-made disasters, shall register with Upson County and pay any approved fees. All short-term, emergency-related residential recreational vehicles must be legally registered and tagged.

Section 2828. - Current non-conforming recreational vehicle (RV) use by owner-occupants as permanent residences.
Intent: It is the intent of this section to greatly reduce and over time phase-out the current, widespread, illegal use of recreational vehicles (RV) in Upson County as non-camping, permanent residences. Upson County recognizes the existence of this activity in the community and wishes to ease the hardship that eliminating the permanent residential use of RVS by owner-occupants may create in certain circumstances. It is intended that this ordinance section create a mechanism that will enable, under prescribed circumstances, granting temporary, legal, non-conforming status (grandfathering) to recreational vehicles and owner-occupants currently involved in this activity.
A.
There is hereby created an "Upson County Transitional Residential RV Registration Program" to be administered by the county manager or his designee.
B.
The program shall include, as a minimum, the following elements:
1.
Eligibility. Only owner-occupied RVs and the owners themselves may be registered in the program. The program is not for RV renters or renter-occupied RVs.
2.
Registration and registration application. Program registration is required to participate in the program and shall be initiated by Upson County within 60 days of approval of this ordinance through an application process, whereby existing recreational vehicles being used as permanent residences shall be listed on a registration application by their owner-occupants who are also subjects of the application. Applications must be submitted by the RV owner-occupants. The owner-occupants who register at program startup are the only occupants who may be part of the program and they must remain in the same RV on the same property to remain in the program. The program registration window shall last for 90 calendar days. Unoccupied recreational vehicles are not eligible for registration. Initiation of the program may be extended by the board of commissioners.
3.
Minimum information provided. Program registration shall include, as a minimum, the make, model, year made and size of the recreational vehicle, copy of the title and/or registration, the land and recreational vehicle owners' name(s), photo ID and contact information, any other recreational vehicle occupants' names and contact information, address and tax ID number of the property where the recreational vehicle is located. Applications must be deemed complete before the program deadline to be considered for the program.
4.
Required inspection. Each recreational vehicle to be considered for program registration must pass a life safety, sanitation and utility inspection by the Upson County Building Official, his successor or designee, following submittal and approval of a complete application. Each RV must have a permitted, operational septic tank and permitted, operational well or county water service. The registration application file shall include inspection results reports and photographs of the RV. RVs may be determined to be ineligible for the program if they fail the inspection, any follow up inspections and/or any other inspections resulting from a complaint or other actions resulting in a finding of unacceptable living conditions.
5.
Additional requirements. In addition to meeting minimum life safety, sanitation and utility inspections, each RV must have its proper 911 address signage and county solid waste service to be accepted into and remain in the program.
6.
Registration decal. Successfully registered RVs shall display the annually-provided registration decal on the rear of the RV.
C.
Registration application fee and annual registration. The initial application process and annual RV registration thereafter shall include a $25.00 fee to offset administrative costs. Annual renewal registration fee and penalty delinquency of more than 60 calendar days shall mean that the RV is no longer a part of the program. Penalties are set at $10.00 for each 30 days of delinquency or portion thereof after the 30th day of delinquency.
D.
State tag and registration. Registered RVs shall not be inspected or fined by Upson County Code Enforcement for expired tags or state registration, as long as the RVs are part of the program.
E.
Change of status. Registered RVs shall lose their legal, non-conforming status, and shall no longer be a part of this program, if registered ownership is transferred or sold, if the RV is moved from its registered location, if the registered occupants leave the registered RV and/or if the RV is completely destroyed or damaged beyond 50 percent of its resale value at the time of damage.
F.
Additions prohibition. No structural additions may be built onto or attached to the RV except as may be required for certified handicapped or medically-necessary access or as permitted by the County's variance procedure. Building permits shall be required.
G.
Recreational vehicles being used as permanent, owner-occupied residences, but not registered as a part of this program before the registration deadline, are illegal non-conforming uses and are therefore subject to code enforcement action and immediate cessation of all illegal activities.
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2829. - Current non-conforming recreational vehicle (RV) parks—Design standards.
Existing recreational vehicle parks that do not meet the design standards of the county's RV park requirements shall be registered by their owner(s) with the county manager or his designee during the designated registration period. The registration form shall list all of the design standards that the park does not meet and those that it does meet. These RV parks are deemed legal nonconforming uses, based upon their current configuration, and will continue as such until such time as any new or additional RV spaces are added in excess of those existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance. These legal nonconforming RV parks are not required to meet Upson County's minimum RV park design standards unless new or additional RV spaces are added to the park. No additional RV spaces may be added to the RV park without meeting the missing design standards. Any further deviation from the design standards shall require a variance from the planning commission,
( Ord. No. 266 , § 1, 10-9-2018)
Section 2830. - Administration and enforcement.
A.
Consistent with article 4 of this ordinance, this ordinance section shall be administered and enforced by the county manager or his/her designee(s). The authority shall include the ability to order, in writing, the remedy of any condition found in violation of this ordinance and the ability to institute legal action to insure compliance with the provisions, including injunction, abatement or other appropriate action or proceeding.
B.
The county manager or his/her designees are hereby authorized to make inspections as are necessary to determine compliance with these requirements.
C.
Any person whether owner, lessee, principal agent, employee or otherwise, who violates any provisions of this ordinance section, or permits any such violation, or fails to comply with any of the requirements hereof, or who establishes or uses any park in violation of any detailed statement of plans submitted by him and approved under the provisions of this ordinance section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction shall be subject to punishment as provided by article 4 of this zoning ordinance.
D.
Any park established, expanded or improved contrary to any of the provisions of this ordinance and any use of any park in terms of operation and maintenance contrary to any of the provisions of this ordinance, related permits or Upson County-approved plans shall be and is declared unlawful.
