The term "malt beverage" does not include sake, known as Japanese rice wine. This definition is not designed to be in conflict with O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(13), and if there is any conflict therewith the definition contained in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(13) shall be the accepted definition.
Retail dealer means any person who engages in selling beer or wine at retail within the county, which includes any person serving spiritous liquors, beer or wine for a pecuniary consideration within the limits of the county.
Spirituous liquors means distilled spirits as defined in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2.
Wholesale dealer means any person who sells beer or wine to a retail dealer.

The term "wine" does not include cooking wine mixed with salt or other ingredients so as to render it unfit for human consumption as a beverage. A liquid first shall be deemed to be a wine at that point in the manufacturing process when it conforms to the definition of wine. This definition is not designed to be in conflict with O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(25), and if there is any conflict therewith the definition contained in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(25) shall be the accepted definition.
