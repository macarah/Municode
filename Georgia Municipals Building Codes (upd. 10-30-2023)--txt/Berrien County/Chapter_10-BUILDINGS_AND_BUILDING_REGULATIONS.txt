Costs may be imposed upon the respondent, which costs must be paid as a condition for the issuance of any permit or license necessary to abate the nuisance, in addition to regular permit fees.
(d)
If the court determines that a dwelling, building or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use or is vacant, dilapidated and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, he shall state his findings and conclusions in writing, and cause to be served upon the owner and parties in interest an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial or business use or to vacate, close and secure the dwelling, building or structure as a human habitation; or

In no event shall the court order the removal or demolition of any dwelling, building or structure except upon a finding, based upon competent evidence, that the cost of repair, alteration or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of law; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall prevent the governing authority from exercising the power of eminent domain for the taking of such dwelling, building or structure for public purposes.

(f)
The cost of bringing a complaint pursuant to this chapter, together with any costs reasonably incurred by the county in abatement of a public nuisance after determination thereof by the magistrate court, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the costs by the county administrator in the office of the county clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes. If a dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the county, the county administrator shall sell in a commercially reasonable manner all salvageable materials therefrom and deduct the proceeds from the costs of demolition.

(2)
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the three year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the county; and
(3)
Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, not be paid as herein provided or be unpaid after the passage of the three year period, the county may enforce the collection of the full amount due in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable tax statutes; provided, however, this procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4, art. 3.
(h)
Nothing contained herein shall prevent or prohibit the magistrate court from punishing by its contempt powers any owner or parties in interest that willfully fail or refuse to comply with an order entered in accordance with this article.
