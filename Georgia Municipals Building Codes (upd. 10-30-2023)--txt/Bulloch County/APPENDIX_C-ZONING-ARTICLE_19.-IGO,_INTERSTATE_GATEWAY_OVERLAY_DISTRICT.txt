(2)
The service road shall occupy a publicly dedicated right-of-way of no less than 40 feet in width, and shall be improved with a roadway no less than 28 feet in width (including raised curbs and a 24-foot wide travelway) in order to accommodate two-way vehicular traffic to and from the adjoining properties. The paved travelway and curbs shall be centered within the right-of-way. (See figure 19-1, below.)
(3)
A service road and utility easements running through a property that has frontage on US 301 to a property located to the rear that has no public street access, shall be located by the county in consultation with the property owners involved.
(4)
The service road travelway shall be paved and constructed to the public road cross-sectional standards contained in the Bulloch County Subdivision Regulations under section 7.1, paragraphs (a) through (j) or as most recently amended.

The plans must clearly show the location and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per façade.
(2)
Groups of buildings on the same parcel of land may be reviewed and permitted as a single project rather than individual buildings. Grouping of similar buildings is encouraged to minimize the number of reviews required and to allow for originality and design flexibility.
(d)
General architectural requirements.
(1)
All ground mounted mechanical, HVAC and like systems shall be obscured from view on all sides by an adequately opaque wall, fence or lattice made of materials compatible with the building's materials, or with dense evergreen landscaping.

2  Rear facades that are visible from a public or private street, or face the front or side of an adjacent building, must meet the standards for a front/side façade.
3  Any façade of a pre-engineered metal building visible from and within 200 feet of the right-of-way of US 301 may not be exposed metal siding, and must be covered with an alternate building material allowed by this section.
(3)
Accent/trim exterior building material. Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but must not exceed ten percent of total wall area per façade.
(4)
Façade calculations:
a.
With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building materials used on any one façade. When a material is restricted as a percentage in table 19.2, such as stucco, siding, etc., the building material may not be combined with another restricted building material. The allowed façade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors.
b.
The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the net square footage of wall area per façade. A building material that is allowed (such as brick) may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted (such as stucco) is allowed as a maximum percentage.
For example, a commercial building has a front façade with a gross façade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors. Begin with the net square footage of wall area of 800 square feet (1,200 minus 400) for required building material calculations. In this case, the front façade of a commercial building with a net wall area of 800 square feet shall have no more than 200 square feet of stucco on the front façade (800 × 25% = 200). The balance must be brick or another allowed material without a percentage restriction.
(f)
Roof requirements.
(1)
Sloped roofs. Sloped roofs must be covered with shingles, tiles, standing seam metal, or other material with similar appropriate texture and appearance. Tar paper and corrugated metal roofs are not allowed on sloped roofs.
(2)
Mansard roofs. Mansard roofs shall have a minimum pitch of 2:1 (60º) and a maximum pitch of 90º (vertical), with a minimum four-foot vertical surface rise. The top story of a building may simulate a mansard roof but the minimum and maximum pitches will apply.
(3)
Canopies. Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have a flat roof with vertical or factory formed facing of finished sheet metal.
(4)
Arcade for multi-tenant commercial building. For any multi-tenant commercial shopping center or strip retail/service center, a covered arcade shall be provided along the front façade of the building. Arcades are covered walkways connected to or separate from the principal building. They should be designed in a manner that provides architectural depth to the building and includes covered areas for relief from the weather. The arcade must be a minimum of five feet in width.
(g)
Alternate standards.
(1)
The architectural design standards of this section 1908 are intended to be followed as outlined above. In the event the intent of these standards can be achieved with minor deviations that do not substantially affect the purpose and intent of this section, the county manager or their designee has the authority to modify the specific provisions on a case-by-case basis.
(2)
If substantial modifications or changes to the architectural design standards of this section 1908 are desired for a particular property or building, the property owner may apply for a variance to modify these standards. Any application for an alternate architectural design standard shall be accompanied with proposed elevations, building material descriptions and renderings necessary for the planning and zoning commission to make a determination whether the alternate proposal meets the intent of these requirements. A variance approval may be granted with conditions, modifications or requirements deemed necessary to maintain the high level of development quality intended by the IGO district.

(d)
Luminaries adjacent to residential districts. For any commercial use adjacent to an area zoned AG-5, R-80, R-40, R-25, R-15, R-2, R-3 or MHP, or residential portions of a PUD, all luminaries, hereafter installed for outdoor lighting shall be full cut-off luminaries, as defined by this section, or another luminary that does not emit any direct light above the horizontal plane of the lowest part of the luminary.
