Sec. 5-23. - General provisions.
(a)
Term of franchise.
(1)
Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, the county may grant cable franchises authorizing the franchisee to construct, expand, reconstruct, maintain, use and or operate in, along, across, on, over, through, above and under the rights-of-way to provide cable services. Such franchises shall be granted for terms not to exceed 15 years.
(2)
In determining the length of franchise to grant to a potential franchisee or the length of a franchise renewal, the county shall determine the applicant's willingness and ability to meet the community's needs as such needs have been identified, and the flexibility of the franchisee to accommodate those needs as they change during the term of the franchise.
(b)
Grant of franchise.
(1)
The county may make the grant of a cable franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction within a prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition will cause the franchise to become null and void, subject to the procedural requirement of section 5-23(aa) hereof.
(2)
In evaluating an application for a cable franchise, the county may consider, among other things, the ability of public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, the potential disruption to users of public rights-of-way, and resultant inconvenience, if any, to the public.
(3)
The county may hold a public hearing to consider an application. Based upon the application, the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the county manager or staff, and any other information relevant to the application, the county shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny an application.
(c)
Compensation to county for franchise.
(1)
As compensation for the privilege granted under a cable franchise for the use of the rights-of-way to construct and operate a cable system for the provision of cable services, franchisee shall pay to the county a cable franchise fee equal to five percent of its gross revenues. The franchise fee shall be paid on a quarterly basis.
(2)
Franchisee may calculate gross revenues for purposes of determining the cable franchise fee owed on either a cash or accrual basis, provided, however, the franchisee must use the same method throughout the term of the franchise absent the prior written consent of the county manager. If franchisee calculates gross revenues on an accrual basis, franchisee may subtract its actual bad debt expenses for the relevant period from gross revenues, as appropriate, provided, however, that any bad debt subsequently collected shall be included in gross revenues, as appropriate, in the period in which the bad debt is collected.
(3)
A franchisee shall file within three months following the end of each of its fiscal years a statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year. The statement shall contain detail on the revenue items contained within the definition of gross revenues in section 5-21(a) herein, and shall be certified by a certified public accountant or the franchisee's chief financial officer. The franchisee shall bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. Upon request by the county, which request shall not be made more often than once every three years, franchisee shall cause an independent audit to be performed of its franchise fee payments for any period previously un-audited from the present to the adoption of the existing franchise agreement. Such audit shall be at franchisee's expense. A request by the county under this provision shall not prevent the county from undertaking its own audits, at times deemed appropriate by the county, of franchisee's performance under this article and its franchise for any period previously un-audited from the present to the adoption of the existing franchise agreement.
(4)
The acceptance by the county of any payment from franchisee of the cable franchise fee shall not constitute a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the county may have against franchisee for performance of any of its obligations under its franchise, or local, state or federal law, including, without limitation, franchisee's obligation to pay the proper franchise fee amount owed.
(5)
Following the expiration or the termination for any reason of its franchise, franchisee shall pay the franchise fee owed as of the date that its operations ceased within 90 calendar days of ceasing such operations. Such payment shall be accompanied by a gross revenues audit report prepared by a certified public accountant showing the revenues received, and any deductions made therefrom, by franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year.
(d)
Minimum facilities and services.
(1)
The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all cable franchises granted by the county. The county may require in a franchise agreement that a franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where it determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the application, that the additional requirements are necessary to meet public needs.
a.
Each cable system shall offer services that meet the current and future needs of the county. The franchise agreement shall include a complete description of the design of the cable system and how the cable system will meet the current and projected needs of the county. For new franchisees, such service shall, at a minimum, be comparable to the services offered by existing franchisees in the county.
b.
The cable system must have two-way capability.
c.
All television signals received by franchisee for carriage on franchisee's cable system that contain closed caption information for the hearing impaired shall be transmitted over franchisee's cable system with such closed caption information for the hearing impaired.
d.
All antennas, supporting structures, and outside plant used in operating and maintaining franchisee's cable system must comply with the recommendations of the National Electric Safety Code and all federal, state, county, county and/or utility laws, ordinances, rules and regulations on tower structures and outside plant.
e.
All construction, installation and maintenance of franchisee's cable system must comply with the National Electrical Safety Code, all state and local laws and regulations, and accepted industry practices.
f.
Franchisee must not design, install, or operate its system in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the electrical system located in any building, the cable system of another franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast signals.
g.
Franchisee's cable system shall meet or exceed all technical and signal quality standards of the FCC.
h.
Franchisee shall ensure that both audio and video reception of cable channels with predominantly adult programming, both analog and digital, not subscribed to by subscribers, are completely blocked.
(2)
Franchisees may, and upon request from the county shall, periodically survey subscribers to assess programming preferences. The results of such surveys shall be submitted to the county upon completion. If requested by the county, franchisee shall submit proposed questions to the county for its review prior to undertaking the survey. If the survey indicates subscriber preference for programming not presently carried on franchisee's cable system, franchisee shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to determine the technical, contractual and economic feasibility of adding such programming, and shall report its finding to the county.
(3)
Periodic reviews:
a.
When the county deems it advisable, but no more often than every five years during the term of the franchise, the county shall give notice to the franchisee and the public that it is commencing an evaluation of the franchisee's performance under its franchise. The results of this evaluation shall be reported at a public board of commissioners meeting. The primary purpose of this evaluation shall be to consider whether the franchisee has substantially complied with, or made all reasonable efforts to comply with, all substantive requirements of its franchise, especially the customer service standards.
b.
Notice of all evaluation sessions shall be published in the same way as a legal notice.
c.
If an evaluation proceeding has revealed deficiencies in the franchisee's performance under its franchise, the county shall notify the franchisee and request that the deficiencies be corrected within a reasonable period of time. If the deficiencies involve substantial non-compliance and repeated non-compliance with the franchise and are not, or cannot be, corrected within a reasonable period of time, the county may initiate a proceeding proposing the termination of the franchise or other appropriate action.
(4)
Annual performance report:
a.
On or before March 1 of each year, the franchisee shall file a report with the county covering system activity in the prior calendar year. The report shall include:
1.
Changes in programming and rates;
2.
Changes in other services offered;
3.
Capital investments in the system, which impact services in the county, during the year;
4.
A current list of officers and directors;
5.
Proposed changes for the coming year;
6.
A completed subscriber survey, as described in section 5-23(j)(3);
7.
A certification of compliance with customer service standards set forth in section 5-23(j) of this article.
b.
At the county's request, franchisee shall attend a board of commissioners meeting for the purpose of presenting the annual performance report and addressing comments and questions from the board of commissioners and members of the public.
(5)
To assist in its review and evaluations, the county may enlist an independent consultant to conduct an analysis of the cable system and its performance and to submit a report of such analysis to the county. Topics which may be addressed include, but shall not be limited to: franchise fees, services, application of new technologies, cable system technical performance, and related facilities and equipment, subscriber complaints, privacy, amendments, subsequent legal developments, including judicial and FCC rulings, and franchisee or county rules. During evaluations by the county, the franchisee shall cooperate fully with the county and shall provide, without cost, such existing information and documents as the county may reasonably request. Nothing in this section shall be implied as reopening franchise negotiations or making modifications to the franchise.
(e)
Public, educational, and governmental access channels.
(1)
The county has determined that it is in the public interest for all franchisees to provide non-commercial public, educational, and governmental ("PEG") access channels on the cable system for the benefit of the public, as determined by the county. The provision of such PEG access channels shall be without charge to the county. Unless specifically allowed by the county, all PEG access channels shall be available to all subscribers on a basis equal in quality and accessibility to other basic tier services and shall be placed on the basic tier of service without separately listed charge. The county's use of underwriting to support programming on the access channels shall not constitute commercial use of such channels.
(2)
Should the franchisee, due to business necessity, realign channels which results in PEG channels being relocated, the franchisee will assist the PEG channel operator with advertising and reasonable expenses required to inform viewers of the new channel location.
(3)
The number of PEG access channels to be provided by each franchisee shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The county may designate PEG channels for use by public, educational or governmental access users or organizations at its sole discretion. The county may designate one channel for several users or users on a shared basis. The county may promulgate rules and procedures for the use of channels, facilities, equipment and other support designated for PEG access. In the case of any franchise under which channel capacity is designated for PEG use, the county may promulgate rules and procedures under which franchisee is permitted to use such channel capacity for the provision of other services if such channel capacity is not being used for such designated purposes.
(4)
Each franchisee shall interconnect its system with all other systems operating under a franchise granted by the county so that the channels designated for PEG access shall be transmitted on all systems simultaneously and on the same channels, where technically feasible. This obligation includes the provision of all devices required to accomplish such interconnection. To the extent that a franchisee is providing facilities, support or programming for PEG access channels that another franchisee is required to carry by interconnection, the interconnecting franchisee shall on a quarterly basis reimburse such franchisee for a pro rata share of the out-of-pocket expenditures made during such quarter by the franchisee to provide such facilities, support or programming. The interconnecting franchisee's pro rata share shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the interconnecting franchisee's subscribers and the denominator of which is the total number of subscribers of all franchisees receiving such PEG content, determined as of the end of each calendar quarter.
(5)
Franchisee shall have no rights to PEG channel programming by virtue of cable-casting or distributing such programming over its cable system, except for franchisee's right to transmit such programming to all the subscribers receiving a signal from the cable system head-end serving the Bulloch area. All rights to programming content and intellectual property of any type transmitted by franchisee shall remain the property of the owner, regardless of the individual or entity requesting transmission. No intellectual property transmitted over PEG Channels or bandwidth shall be retransmitted by franchisee or any affiliates in whole or in part without the consent of its owner.
(6)
The PEG channels shall be placed under the authority of the county for use related to governmental and educational purposes or individual expression. PEG channel use may include sponsorships and underwriting. No restrictions shall be placed on the use of these channels for a public purpose of a governmental entity or curriculum requirement of an educational institution, except as provided in this article and in individual franchises. As provided by law, franchisee shall not exercise editorial control over programming of any PEG channel. At no time shall the franchisee interrupt at its head-end or hub site the signal provided on any PEG channel without the express consent of the county, except in circumstances beyond the franchisee's control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee may undertake normal maintenance activities that will interrupt the signal provided that such maintenance activities will be scheduled to cause a minimum of disruption to planned programming.
(7)
In the event it becomes both technologically and economically feasible to provide over the same channel video, audio, and/or data signals, franchisee shall meet and discuss with the county those alternative uses for the PEG channels.
(8)
If a franchise requires a periodic re-evaluation of the number of PEG channels to be provided by a franchisee, the usage of such channels shall be as provided herein. An educational or government access channel shall be considered to be minimally utilized when 50 percent of the 18 available cablecast hours per day are programmed, of which at least 20 percent is for non-repeat programming. An educational or government access channel shall be considered to be fully utilized when 80 percent of the 18 available cablecast hours are programmed (of which at least 50 percent is for non-repeat programming). A public access channel shall be considered to be minimally utilized when 25 percent of the programming is non-repeat programming. A public access channel shall be considered to be fully utilized when 80 percent of the programming is for non-repeat programming. The calculation of the minimum and maximum described shall be measured in each one-week period averaged over one calendar year. The available cablecast hours for purposes of this paragraph do not include the hours between midnight and 6:00 a.m. If additional channels are required to be provided, but can only be accommodated on digital, or non-basic tiers, franchisee shall cooperate with the county in determining the channel assignments to be made and notification requirements to subscribers.
(9)
The franchisee shall provide reasonable technical assistance necessary to transmit access programming on the PEG channels as directed by the county, as applicable, on an as-needed basis.
(10)
In addition to the requirement that franchisee provide PEG access channels, franchisee may also be required to provide funds for production facilities and equipment for PEG channels in an amount to be set forth in the franchise agreement. All such facilities and equipment shall be for the benefit of the county and its residents and shall be subject to the sole control of the county, but franchisee may hold legal ownership title.
(11)
It is contemplated that the county may award more than one franchise for the provision of cable services in the county. Each franchisee shall be required to contribute to meeting the county's identified needs and goals with regard to the provision of PEG channels. Toward that end, the county may require each franchisee to interconnect with other franchisees, to provide separate PEG channels, or to provide cash contributions. The details and substance of such requirements shall be negotiated with each franchisee and included in the individual franchise agreements, with the goal that the obligations to meet the county's identified needs and goals shall be equitably shared among all franchisees.
(f)
Service to public institutions; additional government access support; institutional network. Franchisees shall be required to provide cable service without charge to facilities within the county passed by the cable system that are owned or predominantly occupied by the county, county or a public educational institution, that are devoted to predominantly educational or governmental use and that are specified in the franchise agreement.
(g)
Emergency use of cable system. Franchisee shall install and maintain an audio override on all channels for transmission of emergency messages and alerts as required by federal law. Franchisee shall also cooperate and coordinate with the county emergency preparedness coordinator and with the county manager's designee with regard to emergency communications.
(h)
Lockout devices. Franchisee shall make available at a reasonable charge to any residential subscriber, upon the request of such subscriber of the cable system, a parental guidance or lock-out device which shall permit the subscriber, at his or her option, to eliminate the audio and visual transmissions from any channel reception. Franchisee shall advise all residential subscribers annually of the availability of such devices.
(i)
Reserved.
(j)
Customer service requirements for cable systems.
(1)
Franchisee shall comply with each of the customer service requirements set forth in attachment "A" to the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(2)
If franchisee is building a new cable system in the county, it shall have a period of six months from the time its cable system is operational and it is providing cable service in the county, to come into compliance with the requirements. If franchisee is building a new cable system in the county in phases, it shall have a period of 90 calendar days from the time each phase of its cable system is operational and it is providing cable service within that phase, to come into compliance with the requirements.
(3)
Franchisee shall submit quarterly reports certifying its compliance with the customer service requirements and explaining any instances of non-compliance during the report period.
(4)
In every other year during the term of its franchise, and upon request by the county, franchisee shall conduct annual surveys of subscribers to assess subscriber satisfaction with the franchisee's customer service. The surveys shall be performed by an independent entity. Complete copies of the annual compliance reports and surveys shall be provided to the county at the time of franchisee's annual performance report, as set forth in section 5-23(d)(4). If requested by county, franchisee shall submit copies of proposed survey questions prior to the survey being undertaken for the county's review and comments. Customer surveys to assess compliance with the telephone answering standards of attachment A to the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be included in the biannual surveys if any one of franchisee's quarterly reports within the 12 calendar months preceding the subscriber survey indicates a clear failure of franchisee to comply with such standards. A clear failure to comply is shown by franchisee's failure to meet the compliance percentages contained in attachment A to the ordinance from which this article is derived, sections 7 and 10 thereof.
(k)
Cable system subscriber privacy. A franchisee shall protect the privacy of all subscribers pursuant to the provisions of section 631 of the Cable Act.
(l)
Discrimination prohibited.
(1)
No franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant illegal preferences or advantages to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers, nor subject any such persons or group of persons to any illegal prejudice or any disadvantage; provided, however, a franchisee may offer discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers provided that such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis. A franchisee shall not deny, delay, or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political affiliation, except for discounts for the elderly or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.
(2)
A franchisee shall not deny cable service to any potential subscriber because of the income of the residents of the area in which the subscriber resides.
(m)
Rates. If a cable franchise franchisee is subject to effective competition, nothing in this article shall be construed to allow the county in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, to regulate rates for franchisee's cable system, installation, disconnection, or equipment rental, such prohibition of rate regulation being in accordance with state and federal law. If, at any time during the term of its franchise, franchisee is not subject to effective competition, the county reserves the right to institute cable service rate regulation as permitted under applicable law.
(n)
Technical standards.
(1)
Any cable system within the county shall meet or exceed the technical standards set by the FCC as hereafter may be amended or adopted, and any other standards set forth in this article, the franchise, or other applicable federal or state laws or regulations.
(2)
All construction, installation and maintenance shall comply with the National Electric Safety Code, the National Electric Code, all laws and accepted industry practices, and as such may hereafter be amended or adopted.
(3)
The county may require an annual proof of performance test or other tests to be performed at the expense of the franchisee. At the times specified in the franchise agreement, the franchisee shall perform at its expense proof of performance tests designed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this article, the franchise agreement, and then existing FCC requirements. If the county has provided written notice of its desire to observe performance tests, the franchisee shall notify the county so that the county may have an observer present. The franchisee shall provide the proof of performance test results promptly to the county. The county shall have the right to inspect the cable system facilities during and after their construction to ensure compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement, this article and FCC standards.
(4)
A franchisee shall not design, install, or operate its facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the electrical system located in any building, the cable system of another franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast signals.
(o)
Security fund.
(1)
Within 30 calendar days of the effective date of the franchise, the franchisee shall post with the county a security fund to ensure the faithful performance of all provisions of this article, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the county, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the county which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system. At the franchisee's option, the security fund may take the form of a cash deposit, a surety bond, a letter of credit, or other forms of security as approved by the county. The minimum amount of a security fund shall be $15,000. The minimum security fund amount shall increase on January 1 of each year by the same percentage that the Consumer Price Index applicable to the county area increases. The county shall inform franchise applicants of the amount of the required security fund. A franchise agreement may provide for a security fund greater than the minimum specified in this article where the county determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that such larger security fund is necessary in light of the size of the franchisee's system or the nature of its financial qualifications or experience, or to protect the public or to provide adequate incentive to the franchisee to comply with this article and the franchise agreement.
(2)
If franchisee posts a cash security, the county shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of franchisee but may not be withdrawn by franchisee; all interest will be added to and become part of the security fund during the term of the franchise. The county shall monitor the amount of interest being deposited into the cash security fund to determine whether the security fund is increasing by the same amount that the Consumer Price Index referenced in paragraph (1) is increasing. In the event that the county determines that the interest deposits into the security fund are not maintaining the security fund at the level required by application of the Consumer Price Index, the county shall notify the franchisee that additional cash deposits are required.
(3)
If franchisee posts a security fund other than cash, the amount of the security fund shall be increased each year by the same percentage amount that the Consumer Price Index referenced in paragraph (1) is increasing. The county shall notify the franchisee during the first calendar quarter each year of the additional funds required.
(4)
If a franchisee fails to pay the county any fees or taxes, liquidated damages, damages, or costs or expenses incurred by the county by reason of any act or default of the franchisee, or if the franchisee fails to comply with any provision of this article or of its franchise agreement that the county manager determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security fund, the county manager may, after 30 calendar days notice to the franchisee, withdraw that amount with any interest or penalties from the security fund. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice from the county manager, the franchisee may file a written request for a board of commissioners hearing on the matter. Such hearing shall be held within 30 calendar days of the county manager decision to withdraw from the security fund, unless the county wishes to extend the time period. During such hearing, the franchisee shall have an opportunity to be heard, to present evidence and testimony in its behalf. The county shall not withdraw any funds until such time as the hearing has been completed. If the franchisee does not file a written request to the board of commissioners for a hearing within the prescribed time period, then the county may withdraw such funds as provided in the resolution. After any withdrawal from the security fund, the county shall promptly notify the franchisee of the amount and date of the withdrawal.
(5)
Within 30 calendar days after notice to the franchisee that an amount has been withdrawn by the county from the security fund, the franchisee shall pay into its security fund sufficient funds to restore the security fund to the total amount in the fund immediately prior to the withdrawal. If the franchisee fails to restore the security fund to the original amount within 30 calendar days, the entire security fund remaining may be forfeited, and/or such failure may be considered a material breach of this article and the franchise agreement may be used as grounds for revocation of the franchise.
(6)
The security fund will become the property of the county in the event the franchise is revoked. The franchisee is entitled to the return of the balance of the security fund that remains following the expiration of the franchise, provided that there is no outstanding default or unpaid amounts owed to the county by the franchisee.
(7)
The rights reserved to the county with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the county, whether reserved by this article, by the franchise agreement, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund will affect any other right the county may have.
(p)
Payment of audit costs and consultant and legal fees.
(1)
If an audit of franchise fee payments is performed by the county and such audit findings indicate an underpayment by franchisee of franchise fees in the amount of four percent of more, all costs of such audit shall be reimbursed by the franchisee to the county upon receipt of written notice. Additionally, in the event any audit, whether performed by the county or by franchisee upon county's request, results in a finding of underpayment by the franchisee, franchisee shall pay a late payment penalty to the county in the amount of one percent per month from the time the payment was originally due.
(2)
A franchisee shall pay all costs and fees of outside consultants and retained counsel incurred by the county for processing and evaluating franchisee's application and for reviewing and administering franchisee's compliance with this article, and with the franchise agreement and other applicable ordinances, laws, rules or regulations. Franchisee's obligations for such costs and fees shall not in any event exceed a reasonable amount as set forth in the franchise agreement.
(3)
The grant of an initial franchise, a renewed franchise, an application to modify a franchise agreement, or an application to transfer a franchise may be subject to a processing fee, in an amount not to exceed the county's out-of-pocket costs, including all costs and fees incurred by the county for consultants, analysts and counsel, in considering the application, less the amount of the filing fee set pursuant to section 5-22(b). Within 30 calendar days from the date of the action by board of commissioners granting or denying the franchise, franchise renewal, franchise modification or transfer thereof, the county shall notify the franchisee of the amount of any processing fee and its method of calculation. If the processing fee is not paid to the county within 30 calendar days of the date of the notification, any approvals granted by such board of commissioners action will be null and void.
(q)
Construction schedule.
(1)
Specific construction schedules shall be as provided in the franchise. It is expected that all franchisees shall provide a minimum of 54 video channels for cable service, and that the construction schedule provided, if appropriate, in the franchise shall be sufficient to make such cable service available to all areas of the county no later than mid-way through the term of the franchise, but in no event later than 5 years from the date of board of commissioners approval.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall prevent franchisee from completing the construction of the system earlier than required under the terms of the franchise or from providing more channels than the minimum specified in this article.
(3)
For proposed cable systems, franchisee shall make available to the county manager or his/her designee for review a construction plan and maps for construction of the proposed cable system at least 30 calendar days prior to the start of any and all construction undertaken to complete the cable system. The construction plan shall include design details, equipment specifications, design performance criteria, and street repair details and plans. The construction plan shall also include a map of the entire franchise area and shall clearly delineate the following:
a.
Areas within the franchise area where the constructed cable system will initially be available to subscribers, including a schedule of construction for each year that construction is proposed; and
b.
Areas, if any, within the franchise area where the cable system cannot reasonably be constructed due to lack of present or planned development or other similar reasons, with the areas and the reasons for not serving them clearly identified on the map.
(4)
Failure to comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (3) of this subsection, including any delay beyond the dates specified herein, unless approved in writing in advance by the county, will constitute a material breach of this article and of the franchise agreement and shall result in appropriate sanctions, including without limitation the imposition of penalties prescribed in this article.
(r)
Construction work regulation by county, alterations, public improvements and underground conduit use by franchisee.
(1)
All franchisees must comply with the provisions of the county's ordinances as from time to time amended, with regard to all activities of franchisee in the rights-of-way.
(2)
All franchisees must bury cable television distribution lines and cables which are on private property and which are intended to be installed below ground, within a reasonable time, not to exceed seven working days from the date of installation.
(s)
Bonds.
(1)
If a new cable system is to be constructed by franchisee, before construction of the cable system has commenced, franchisee shall obtain and maintain for one year, at its sole cost and expense, and file with the county, a corporate surety bond with a surety company authorized to do business in the state and found acceptable by the county attorney, in the amount of $500,000.00 to secure franchisee's performance of its obligations and faithful adherence to all requirements under this article and its franchise agreement. After the first initial year, no bond shall be required unless substantial construction is again commenced by franchisee, in which case a bond in the amount of $500,000.00 shall be obtained. Such bond shall secure franchisee's performance of its obligations and faithful adherence to all requirements under this article and its franchise agreement. In the alternative, franchisee may provide an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amounts in lieu of obtaining a bond. The determination of when a bond is required shall be solely within the discretion of the county, taking into account the scope of proposed construction in relation to the size of the cable system then existing. Construction bond requirements contained in the county's ordinances shall be complied with at all times, provided at its sole discretion, the county may reduce or waive altogether the bond requirements contained in this section.
(2)
The rights reserved to the county with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights of the county, whether reserved by this article or authorized by law; and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such bond shall affect any other rights the county may have.
(3)
The bond shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor any intention not to renew be exercised by the surety until sixty (60) calendar days after receipt by the County, by registered mail, of written notice of such intent."
(t)
Enforcement remedies.
(1)
In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the county has the right to apply any one or combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this article, its franchise agreement, or applicable state or federal law:
a.
Liquidated damages. The county may impose liquidated damages in the following amounts. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement and ordinance requirements.
1.
For failure to substantially complete system construction or line extensions as required, unless the county specifically approves a delay for good cause shown, franchisee shall pay up to $1,000.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, the deficiency continues.
2.
For material failure to provide data, documents, reports or information in a timely manner as required, franchisee shall pay up to $200.00 per day, or part thereof, that each violation occurs or continues.
3.
For failure to substantially comply with the material provisions of sections 5-23(d) (minimum facilities and services), 5-23(e) (access channels) and 5-23(o) (technical standards) of this article, franchisee shall pay up to $1,000.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that the violation continues.

7.
Before assessing liquidated damages against franchisee, the county shall give franchisee written notice of its intention to assess such damages. Following receipt of such notice, franchisee and the county shall have a 15-calendar-day period during which time franchisee and the county shall make good faith reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in question. If the dispute is not resolved in that 15-calendar-day period, the county may collect liquidated damages owed, either through drawdown of the security fund as provided in this article, or through any other means allowed by law.
b.
Revocation or termination of franchise. Each franchise is subject to revocation, termination or shortening as the county determines is reasonable pursuant to the provisions of section 5-23(bb) of this article.
(2)
In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the county shall take into consideration the nature of the breach, the person or persons bearing the impact of the breach, and such other matters as the county determines are appropriate.
(3)
In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the county may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(4)
Failure of the county to enforce any requirements of a franchise agreement or this article shall not constitute a waiver of the county's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies.
(5)
Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, the fees, penalties, and procedures for the assessment of liquidated damages for non-compliance with the customer service and consumer protection requirements shall be as set forth in attachment A to the ordinance from which this article is derived.

(8)
If franchisee normally maintains a complete set of books and records in the county, such books and records shall be available for inspection and audit by the county for purposes of ascertaining compliance with requirements of this article and the franchise agreement. If such records are maintained outside of the county in the normal course of business, upon request of the county the specific location of all such records shall be identified and such records shall be made available for inspection by the county or its representatives. All reasonable expenses incurred by the county, not to exceed $3,000.00, in traveling to the location of the records, if outside the county, shall be paid by the franchisee regardless of whether such inspection results in audit findings against franchisee. Such inspection and audit shall be upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours.

In order to ascertain any and all facts relating to the exercise of its authority under this article and the franchise agreement, the county shall have full power and authority from franchisee to: inspect, or cause to be inspected, the books and records of franchisee; inventory and appraise, or cause to be inventoried or appraised, the property of franchisee within the county; compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and records; and prescribe reasonable penalties for the failure or refusal of franchisee to testify or to produce books and records from time to time as reasonably required.
(w)
Interconnection of other service providers.
(1)
Franchisee shall be required to provide interconnection with other service providers in a manner consistent with federal and/or state regulations.
(2)
In case of an emergency or disaster, franchisee shall, upon reasonable request of the county, make available its facilities to the county, without cost, for emergency use.
(x)
Transfer, assignment or lease of franchise.
(1)
Neither its franchise, the cable system, nor any rights or privileges of franchisee under this article or its franchise agreement, either separately or collectively, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by franchisee to any other person, firm, corporation affiliate or entity, without the prior written consent of the county. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(2)
Should the franchisee sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its franchise, including franchisee's facilities, or attempt to do so, without the county's prior consent, the county may revoke the franchise for default, in which event all rights and interest of the franchisee shall cease and no purported sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance shall be effective.
(3)
The prohibitions contained in this section shall not apply to persons that control, are controlled by, or are under common control of franchisee provided the county receives written notice of such pro forma transfer at least 60 days prior to the transfer in accord with county ordinance.
a.
In order for a transfer to be considered pro forma under the terms hereof, franchisee must present to the county a guarantee from its corporate parent guaranteeing all payments under the franchise and all obligations of franchisee under the franchise, in substantially the same form as attached hereto as attachment B to the ordinance from which this article is derived.
b.
A written notice of a pro forma transfer shall include the full legal name of the pro forma transferee, transferee's relationship to franchisee, and names and addresses of contact persons for transferee. The franchisee shall also provide a certificate of good standing from the state secretary of state for transferee.
c.
Unless county notifies franchisee within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice of a pro forma transfer that the transfer does not qualify as a pro forma transfer, citing reasons therefor, the pro forma transfer shall be deemed approved by the county.
(4)
In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a non-pro forma transfer of a franchise, the county shall consider:
a.
The legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee to operate the system;
b.
Whether the incumbent is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this article and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; and
c.
Whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect service or otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
(5)
No application for a non-pro forma transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this article and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee under this article and the franchise agreement.
(6)
Approval by the county of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the county under this article or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.
(7)
Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable.
(y)
Notices. All notices required herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person to the respective parties or sent by certified mail at the addresses set forth in the franchise.
(z)
Violations.
(1)
If the county has reason to believe that franchisee is in violation of this article or of its franchise agreement, the county shall notify franchisee in writing of the violation setting forth the nature of such violation. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice, franchisee shall respond in writing to provide explanation or documentation to support that the violation did not occur. Franchisee shall be allowed 30 calendar days to cure violations after written notice is received from the county, by taking appropriate steps to comply with the terms of this article and any lawful regulations. If the nature of the violation is such that it cannot be fully cured within 30 calendar days, the period of time in which franchisee must cure the violation shall be extended for such additional time necessary to complete the cure, provided that:
a.
Franchisee shall have promptly commenced to cure; and
b.
Franchisee is diligently pursuing its efforts to cure.
(2)
Upon evidence being received by the county that violations of this article, the franchise agreement, any County Charter provisions or any ordinances lawfully regulating franchisee in the construction and operation of its facilities have occurred, or continue to occur after the 30-calendar-day period, and any additional time necessary to cure, the county may cause an investigation to be made. If the county finds that such a violation continues to exist or has occurred, then the county may take any action authorized by law, including forfeiture of the franchise or a suit in court to compel compliance. If, in any such proceeding, default is finally established, franchisee shall pay to the county the reasonable expenses incurred in the prosecution of such suit and all of the county's damages and reasonable costs (including reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses).
(3)
Failure by the county to enforce any rights under this article does not constitute a waiver of such rights.
(aa)
Forfeiture and termination.
(1)
In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the county under this article or otherwise, the county reserves the right to terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of franchisee there-under in the event of material breach of its terms and conditions, subject to reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, as provided herein.
(2)
Material breaches of this article specifically include, but are not limited to:
a.
Transactions which have the effect of circumventing the payment of required franchise fees due under this article and/or evasion of payment of the franchise fees due under this article by non-collection or non-reporting of revenues, bartering or any other means which unlawfully evade the actual collection of revenues pursued by franchisee. The foregoing shall not constitute a substantial breach if the violation occurs without the fault of franchisee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control.
b.
Any violation of county ordinances.
(3)
In the event franchisee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of the franchise or of this article is prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. Such causes beyond franchisee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, natural disasters, civil emergencies and labor unrest or strikes. Franchisee shall notify the county whenever performance is prevented or impaired. Franchisee shall not be excused from performance of any of its obligations under this article or its franchise by mere economic hardship, nor misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees.
(4)
If, within 30 calendar days following written notice from the county to the franchisee that it is in material violation of this article or of other county ordinances, or is in material breach of the franchise agreement, the franchisee has not taken corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the county may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation of the franchise or reduction in the term of the franchise, stating its reasons.
(5)
A termination or reduction in the term of the franchise shall be declared only by a written decision of the board of commissioners after an appropriate public proceeding before the board of commissioners, which shall accord the franchisee due process and full opportunity to be heard and to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate or reduce the term. All notice requirements shall be met by providing the franchisee at least 30 calendar days prior written notice of any public hearing concerning the proposed termination or reduction of term of the franchise. Such notice shall state the grounds for termination or reduction alleged by county.
(6)
The board of commissioners, after public hearing, and upon finding the existence of grounds to terminate or reduce the term, may declare the franchise terminated, declare the term of the franchise reduced, or excuse such grounds upon a showing by the franchisee of mitigating circumstances or good cause for the existence of such grounds. The board of commissioners determination shall be in writing setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of the written decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee.
(7)
The board of commissioners may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the board of commissioners, six months after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that six-month period:
a.
Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated; or
b.
Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement, and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement.
(8)
In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the county may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the board of commissioners, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
a.
The county has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and
b.
The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the county to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this article.
(9)
If the county revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:
a.
The county may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the county may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense, sell the assets in a commercially reasonable manner, recover from the proceeds the county's incurred costs in taking the action, and provide any remaining sums to the franchisee.
b.
The county, by ordinance of the board of commissioners, may acquire ownership of the former franchisee's equipment and facilities at an equitable price consistent with the Cable Act if the franchise agreement so provides.
c.
If equipment and facilities are abandoned by a former franchisee, the county may sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the assets.
(10)
The county may, upon resolution of the board of commissioners, acquire ownership of and operate a cable system, whether or not such ownership is acquired following revocation or forfeiture of a franchise.
(11)
Where the county has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such other specific obligation as required will result in the forfeiture of the franchise under the provisions of section 5-23(aa) where it is so provided in the franchise agreement, unless the county, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time.
(12)
Neither franchisee's acceptance of its franchise, franchisee's appearance before the board of commissioners at any public hearing concerning proposed termination or reduction of its franchise nor any action taken by the board of commissioners as a result of any such public hearing, including a declaration of termination or reduction of term, or a finding of grounds to terminate or reduce the term, shall be construed to waive or otherwise affect the franchisee's right to seek judicial determination of the rights and responsibilities of the parties under the franchise or this article.
(bb)
Arbitration.
(1)
No matter or dispute between the county and a franchisee relating to this article or a franchise agreement may be subject to arbitration unless specifically provided for in the franchise agreement. Any matter that is subject to arbitration under the specific provisions of a franchise agreement may be subjected to the procedures set forth in subsection (2) below.
(2)
The arbitration procedure employed shall be consistent with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and shall comply with the Georgia Arbitration Act.

Prior to issuance of any franchise, franchisee must certify that it is not delinquent in the payment of any taxes owed to the county and will pay any taxes owed to the county so that such taxes will not become delinquent. If the certification given is determined to be false, such false certification shall constitute grounds for termination of the franchise at the option of the county.
