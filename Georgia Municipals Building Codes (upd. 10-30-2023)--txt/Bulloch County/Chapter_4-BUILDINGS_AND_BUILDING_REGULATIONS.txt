The county GIS division shall establish and assign names for all streets, roads and public ways within the county.
(b)
No new road name assigned by the county GIS division shall be a duplicate of or be similar to (either phonetically or by spelling) any existing street name within the county.
(c)
Existing duplicate road names shall be changed only as necessary to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the enhanced 911 system in the county, as determined in the judgment of the county commission.
(d)
Historical names shall be the prime consideration in the assignment of road names. Additionally, no two part names shall be considered for a road name, per NENA standards, unless there is a significant history behind the name.
(e)
As many segmental roads as possible shall be identified as being a continuous road, thereby eliminating as many road identifying names and numbers as possible. It is recommended that any road serving two or more structures, which may be occupied, should be named and numbered. This will apply both to public and private roads, drives, alleys, and service roads. Each named road within the county should bear a road name sign, whether private or public.
(f)
The county paved roads and historical roads, whether paved or unpaved, shall be named, and as funds are available the names shall be posted. Road naming within subdivisions shall comply with the Bulloch County Subdivision Regulations and in addition be approved by the Bulloch County GIS Division prior to the final subdivision plat being approved and recorded in the office of clerk of superior court of the county. Furthermore, certain roads of historical significance, shall be named and bear the same name and number throughout.
(g)
Upon receipt of a petition in the form and format as specified by the board of commissioners seeking a change of name of an existing named road containing the signatures of the owners or their representatives as specified below of not less than 75 percent of the parcels of property abutting said public road, the board of commissioners shall take under consideration but be under no compulsion to grant said request. At its discretion, the board of commissioners may, but shall not be required to, prior to deciding the issue of the proposed name change, hold a public hearing on the issue.
(1)
The owner of the abutting property shall be deemed to be the person or entity returning the property for ad valorem taxes in the office of the county tax commissioner.
a.
If the property is returned in the name of an estate or trust, the legal representative of the estate or trust must sign the petition.
b.
If the property is returned in the name of a corporation, a corporate officer must sign the petition on behalf of the corporation.
c.
If the property is returned in the name of a partnership, each partner must sign the petition unless the signing partner has written authorization to sign for all other partners.
d.
If, according to the records in the tax commissioner's office, more than one natural person has a life or fee interest in said property, each such interest holder must sign the petition unless the signing interest holder has written permission to sign for the non-signing interest holders.
e.
After receiving the 75 percent of all land owners signatures, a certified letter will be sent, at petitioner's expense, to verify all signatures on the petition.
(2)
The determination by the board of commissioners as to the authority of the person signing the petition and the number of parcels abutting the road shall be final.
(h)
In the event there is a dispute as to the proper name of an existing road or a dispute as to whether an existing road has been previously officially named, the county commission, in its absolute discretion, shall assign a name to the road under the same procedure for the naming of a new road. The decision by the county commissioners as to the name assigned to such road shall be final.

(b)
Any number aside from the assigned number shall be removed from the structure, mailbox, post or stanchion, to prevent confusion with the number assigned in conformance with this chapter.

All numbers shall be made of a durable, clearly visible material and shall contrast with the color of the house, building or other structure.
(e)
All numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or at the side of the appropriate door so that the number is clearly visible from the street. In cases where the building is situated more than 50 feet from the street, the building number shall be placed near the walk, driveway or common entrance to the building, or upon the mailbox, gatepost, fence or other appropriate place so as to be clearly visible from the street.
(f)
In the instance that a building or dwelling or any other property described in this article that requires numbering under this article, is not visible from the road or street for which it is located, the property number shall be posted in close proximity to the driveway for the property.

The numbers must be displayed in an appropriate place which is visible easily during the day or at night from the road or street. "An appropriate place" includes mailboxes, fences, curbs, gate posts, and double-faced signs that are perpendicular to the road.

In addition to, but not in lieu of, the required placements of assigned numbers, the owner, occupant, or agent of a residential structure may place or cause to be placed the assigned number on the driveway of the structure with reflective numbering in close proximity to the public right-of-way as an additional method to assist emergency services in locating the residence.
