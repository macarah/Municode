ARTICLE 8. - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS[4]

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Amd. of April 5, 2005(3) repealed article 8, sections 801—804, in its entirety and replaced it with a new article 8, sections 801—807. Former article 8 pertained to R-25 single-family residential 25,000 square feet, and derived from Ord. No. 1997-38, adopted Nov. 4, 1997; Ord. No. 1997-40, adopted Dec. 2, 1997; Amd. of Nov. 7, 2000(2); Ord. of Jan 2, 2001; Amd. of July 2, 2002(1).

Section 801. - Purpose.
Highway commercial (HC). HC zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve business areas that are motor vehicle oriented, rather then pedestrian oriented. HC districts provide areas that are convenient and attractive for retail activities, business transactions, and services to the public designed primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and services needs not only of residents of the county, but of surrounding communities as well. Off-street parking and minimum yards are required. Properties in this district must be located on a major arterial, secondary arterial, or collector roadways.
General commercial (GC). GC zoning districts are intended to provide adequate space for various types of general commercial business uses, including the retailing of major goods and services of larger scale than allowed in NC districts and other types of more intensive commercial activities involving non-industrial use of chemicals, outdoor displays, sales and storage and establishments that rely on highway oriented passerby traffic.
Neighborhood commercial (NC). NC zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve small business areas of a limited nature that serve primarily the residential neighborhood in which they are located. Development standards for NC districts are designed to promote compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhood. In order to promote such business development so far as is possible and appropriate in each area, uses are prohibited which would create hazards, offensive or loud noises, vibrations, smoke, glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of local business areas in locations proposed in the comprehensive plan to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants and thereby promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations.
Light industrial (LI). LI zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from LI districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.
This district is intended for firms that assemble or fabricate manufactured products that are ready for retail sale. Processing of certain types of agricultural products is allowed in this district. Firms that utilize substantial quantities of water in manufacturing are not permitted in this district.
Heavy industrial (HI). HI zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, higher intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from HI district benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.
