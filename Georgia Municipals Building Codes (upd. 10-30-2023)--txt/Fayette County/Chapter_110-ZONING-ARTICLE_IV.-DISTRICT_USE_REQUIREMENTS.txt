Sec. 110-126. - C-S, Conservation Subdivision District.
(a)
Purpose. The intent of this section is to create a residential conservation subdivision procedure. A conservation subdivision is a residential subdivision where lots arc reduced in size and clustered to protect the natural attributes of the site and provide open space. This open space will be protected from development in perpetuity and will be utilized to protect water quality, water bodies, wetlands, riparian buffers, woodlands, archaeological resources, historic resources, agricultural areas and scenic areas. This open space will also provide flood protection, a reduction in soil erosion and be utilized for recreation. The aforementioned attributes should be taken into consideration in the design of the subdivision. The first step in designing a conservation subdivision is to locate and delineate the area and natural attributes to be preserved. The residential lots are located outside of this area. In addition, the clustering of lots can result in lower infrastructure costs both for installation and maintenance. The creation of the conservation subdivision (C-S) zoning district is to assist the county in fulfilling the goal of permanently protecting greenspace in the county. The conservation subdivision zoning district is intended for those areas designated low density residential (one unit/one acre) and rural residential—2 (one unit/two acres) and rural residential—3 (one unit/three acres) on the county future land use plan map.
(b)
Rezoning requirements. The following is required for a rezoning petition for the conservation subdivision zoning district in addition to what is normally required for a rezoning petition:
(1)
A petition for the conservation subdivision zoning district will require a yield plan. The number of lots allowed in a conservation subdivision will be determined by a yield plan which is a conventional subdivision design based on the dimensional requirements of the R-70 zoning district in those areas designated low density residential (one unit/one acre) and rural residential—2 (one unit/two acres) on the county future land use plan map and based on the dimensional requirements of the R-80 zoning district in those areas designated rural residential—3 (one unit/three acres) on the county future land use plan map. This concept is referred to as neutral density. The yield plan shall contain the check list requirements available in the office of the planning and zoning department. The rezoning petition shall not be filed with the planning and zoning department until the yield plan has been approved by the applicable departments.
(2)
A development plan shall be required for the rezoning petition. The development plan, as approved, shall establish the layout and uses planned for the development. Any change in the approved development plan, which affects the intent and character of the development, the density or land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes, shall be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners upon the recommendation of the planning commission. A petition for a revision of the development plan shall be supported by a written statement as to why the revisions are necessary. Each conservation subdivision shall consist of two areas: the residential area and the conservation area. The conservation area will consist of the environmentally sensitive areas including waterways, water bodies, watershed protection areas, floodplains, wetlands, riparian buffers and woodlands, as well as agricultural areas, existing agricultural structures and historical structures. The conservation area will remain in a natural and undisturbed state with minimal improvements. In addition to what is normally required on the development plan, the development plan shall include the following:
a.
A delineation of the attributes (see subsection (a) of this section) of the site which will be preserved;
b.
A delineation of the residential area and the conservation area including the acreage within each area;
c.
Uses and improvements planned for the conservation area with the acreage devoted to each; and
d.
Indicate and label existing structures to remain.
(c)
Uses permitted within the residential area of a conservation subdivision. The following permitted uses shall be allowed in the residential area of the C-S zoning district:
(1)
Single-family dwelling; and
(2)
Residential accessory structures and uses (see article III of this chapter).
(d)
Conditional uses permitted within the residential area of a conservation subdivision. The following conditional uses shall be allowed in the residential area of C-S zoning district provided that all conditions specified in article V of this chapter are met:
(1)
Home occupation;
(2)
Horse quarters; and
(3)
Developed residential recreational/amenity areas.
(e)
Uses permitted within the conservation area of a conservation subdivision. The following permitted uses and structures shall be allowed in the conservation area of the C-S zoning district:

Trails and paths (impervious trails and paths are limited to five percent of the conservation area);
(2)
Picnic areas which can include picnic tables, grills, benches, playground equipment (swing sets, slides, etc.). Picnic areas and one covered picnic pavilion are required to be set back 50 feet from any residential property line and are limited to five percent of the conservation area. The covered picnic pavilion shall be limited to a maximum of 900 square feet;
(3)

Sec. 110-149. - Planned unit development.
(a)
Purpose. The intent of this section is to:
(1)
Encourage the development of large lots of land as: planned residential developments (PRD), planned industrial parks (PIP), planned retreats or lodges (PRL), planned entertainment farming (PEF), planned outdoor recreation (POR), planned small business center (PSBC), and planned residential and business development (PRBD);
(2)
Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning;
(3)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open spaces;
(4)
Accomplish a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of this chapter;
(5)
Provide for an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lower development and housing costs; and
