(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 1(5-963), 11-14-2013)
Sec. 14-264. - Subdivision, mobile home park water and sewage.
(a)
Subdivision and mobile home park water supply. Connection to a public water supply system shall be required if available within 1,000 feet of the proposed subdivision or mobile home park.
(b)
Subdivision and mobile home park percolation tests. Where required for planning purposes and determination of the general absorptive capacity of soils, the number of percolation tests to be made shall be one per lot, in the area where absorption fields are to be located. Before construction of on-site sewage management systems, individual lots within the proposed development shall comply with section 14-263.
(c)
Subdivision and mobile home park test bores. Where required for planning purposes, test bores to determine groundwater elevations and subsurface rock formations shall be made at locations, in numbers and at depths to be determined by the department or county board of health.
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 1(5-964), 11-14-2013)
Sec. 14-265. - Certification and decertification of septic tank contractors, inspection personnel, pumpers, soil classifiers and maintenance personnel.
(a)
Certification required. Individuals performing services related to site approval, the design, location, installation, inspection and maintenance of an on-site sewage management system, must be certified by the department.
(1)
Guidelines defining certification qualifications for septic tank contractors, inspection personnel, pumpers, soil classifiers and maintenance personnel shall be established by the department and shall be published in the Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems. The guidelines shall be based on education, experience, testing and performance.
(2)
The department shall write a protocol for decertification of persons certified under the provisions of this section.
(3)
Certification shall be required every two years and shall be based on meeting continuing education requirements.
(b)
Fee. The department shall adopt a fee schedule for the certification and recertification of the persons listed in this section.
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 1(5-965), 11-14-2013)
Sec. 14-266. - Maintenance and operation.
(a)
Prohibited discharge. No person shall allow the unapproved discharge or spillage of sewage, nor shall an on-site sewage management system be used or maintained in such a manner that will allow the seepage or discharge of effluent from such system to the ground surface, to a watercourse, drainage ditch, open trench, canal, storm drain or storm sewer, water well, abandoned well, lake, stream, river, estuary, groundwater, or other body of water.
(b)
Maintenance. The property owner shall be responsible for properly operating and maintaining the on-site sewage management system to increase the life expectancy and prevent failure. Maintenance of the system shall be in accordance with the criteria established in the department's current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems. Where an on-site sewage management system is proposed to serve facilities under separate ownership, a contract to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the system signed by all owners, shall exist as a precondition to the issuance of a permit for the construction of an on-site sewage management system.
(c)
Additives. No strong bases, acids or organic solvents shall be used in the operation of an on-site sewage management system.
(d)
Existing system evaluations. If a performance evaluation of an existing system is conducted, the evaluation shall be performed in accordance with the procedure established in the department's current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems.
(e)
Variances. The county board of health may grant variances in the cases of hardship where existing systems are malfunctioning.
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 1(5-966), 11-14-2013)
Sec. 14-267. - Enforcement.
The administration and enforcement of this article shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. ch. 31-5.
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 1(5-967), 11-14-2013)
Sec. 14-268. - Standards for nonconventional on-site sewage management systems.
(a)
The department shall review absorption field products that differ in design from the conventional on-site sewage management system. The following standards will be used to determine equivalency to the conventional on-site sewage management system:
(1)
The design infiltrative surface is the wetted trench bottom area.
(2)
Due to the combined effects of compaction, contact area and fines associated with gravel aggregate, the effective infiltrative surface area is reduced by an estimated 50 percent.
(3)
The minimum amount of effective trench bottom infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
(4)
Sidewall area shall not be considered for design reduction. The minimum amount of effective sidewall infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch-wide gravel system.
(5)
The minimum storage volume required for a system shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch-wide gravel system.
(6)
The design absorption area required is based on the most hydraulically limiting soil horizon that comes into contact with the infiltrative surface of the sidewall, trench bottom and for a distance one foot below the absorption trench bottom.
INFILTRATION AREA FOR CONVENTIONAL 36-INCH-WIDE GRAVEL TRENCH ABSORPTION
EXPAND
Sidewall infiltration area 2 sq. ft./ft. × 0.50 = 1 sq. ft./linear foot
Trench bottom infiltration area 3 sq. ft./ft. × 0.50 = 1.5 sq. ft./linear foot
Storage volume 3 cubic feet/linear foot × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot × 0.35 = 7.85 gallons/linear foot
  (b)
Prior approval. Lots approved for development based on a reduction in absorption trench length up to 50 percent shall continue to be approved and permitted for up to a 50 percent reduction in absorption trench length provided the lot is part of a recorded plat or part of a preliminary development plan submitted to the county board of health within one year of rule adoption. Preliminary plans must include as a minimum: proposed lots and streets with lot identifications, lot dimensions and square footage; a topographic map with watercourses and floodplain identified; a level 3 soil report; the location of the water supply system, rights-of-way, easements and utilities; and the name, registration number and seal of the professional surveyor or engineer.
