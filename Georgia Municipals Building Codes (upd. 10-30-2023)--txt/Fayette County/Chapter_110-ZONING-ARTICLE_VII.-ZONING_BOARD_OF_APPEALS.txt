(Ord. No. 2015-06, § 1, 3-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-11, § 1, 6-22-2017)
Sec. 110-242. - Powers and duties.
(a)
Appeals from actions of the zoning administrator. The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide upon appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of these regulations.
(1)
Who may appeal. Appeals to the zoning board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved by any decision of the zoning administrator. Such appeals, specifying the grounds thereof shall be filed with the planning and zoning department no later than 30 calendar days after the date of notification of the zoning administrator's decision. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(2)
Legal proceedings stayed. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the zoning board of appeals that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the zoning administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order from a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3)
Extent of the zoning board of appeals'power. The zoning board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the zoning administrator. The zoning board of appeals may direct the issuance of a permit. It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to carry out the decisions of the zoning board of appeals.
(b)
Request for a variance. The zoning board of appeals may authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, a variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. However, no lot is eligible for a variance for reduction in lot size, lot width, or road frontage, unless the variance request is for an improved illegal lot. A variance shall not be granted for any requirements of a conditional use with the exception of a legal nonconforming conditional use (see article V of this chapter), or a use of land, building, or structure that is prohibited in the zoning district at issue, except as otherwise provided herein. In exercising the powers described in this subsection, the zoning board of appeals shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other zoning districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the zoning board of appeals that all of the following criteria exist:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and
(2)
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and
(3)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, or structure that is prohibited herein; and
(5)
A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same zoning district are allowed.
(c)
Compliance with standards. Where an appeal/petition to the board is initiated due to an existing violation of this chapter and said appeal/petition is denied, the violation shall be required to be corrected within 30 calendar days of such denial, or as specified by the board, if a greater time period is necessary. The maximum extension of the time shall not exceed 60 calendar days.
(d)
Forms. Appeals, requests for variances, or any other matter within the zoning board of appeals' purview shall be made on forms, as applicable, provided by the planning and zoning department; and all information requested on the forms shall be provided by the appellant/petitioner. Forms shall be filed with the planning and zoning department along with the necessary fees. No form shall be accepted by the planning and zoning department unless it contains all pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee.
(e)
Request for a change of the legal nonconforming use of a structure. The zoning board of appeals may authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, a change in the legal nonconforming use of a structure in accordance with the provisions herein.
(f)
Request for an extension or enlargement of a legal nonconforming use. The zoning board of appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension or enlargement of an existing legal nonconforming use which the board is specifically authorized to consider under the terms herein. Said extensions may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the board that all of the following criteria are present:
(1)
The use is a legal nonconforming use as defined in these regulations; and
(2)
The legal nonconforming use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations applicable to nonconformances; and
(3)
The extension of said legal nonconforming use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property.
(g)
Request for a continuance of a legal nonconforming use. The zoning board of appeals may allow, upon appeal in specific cases, a legal nonconforming use to be re-established after discontinuance for six consecutive months where it is deemed by the zoning board of appeals that all of the following criteria are present:
(1)
The design, construction, and character of the land, building, or structure is not suitable for uses permitted in the zoning district in which the legal nonconforming use is situated; and
(2)
Undue hardship to the property owner would result in not allowing the continuance of a legal nonconforming use; and
(3)
Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such continuance; and
(4)
The use is to be identical to the prior legal nonconforming use.
(h)
Request for an illegal lot to be deemed a nonconforming lot. The zoning board of appeals may deem, upon appeal in specific cases, an illegal lot which is smaller than the minimum lot size for its zoning district, more narrow than the minimum lot width for its zoning district, or has less road frontage than is required for its zoning to be a nonconforming lot. The zoning board of appeals shall employ the following factors for an illegal lot seeking to be deemed a nonconforming lot:
(1)
The transaction giving the appellant/petitioner ownership in the subject property was more than five years from the date of the appeal/petition or if the period of ownership is less than five years the subject property was made illegal more than ten years from the date of the appeal/petition;
(2)
The appellant/petitioner is not the person, or an immediate family member of the person, who caused the subject property to be an illegal lot. For purposes of these procedures, "immediate family" is defined as the spouse, child, sibling, parent, step-child, step-sibling, step-parent, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew of the person who caused the subject property to be an illegal lot; and
(3)
No adjacent property is available to add to the subject property to allow the subject property to meet the minimum requirements for its zoning district. In determining whether adjacent property is available, if adding any adjacent property to the subject property would no longer allow the adjacent property to meet the minimum requirements of the adjacent property's zoning district, then the adjacent property is not available. Additionally, any adjacent property which is part of an illegal lot shall not be deemed available for purposes of these variance procedures, unless the adjacent illegal lot is unimproved and the entirety of the adjacent illegal lot is combined with the subject property. If adjacent property is available, the cost of acquiring the adjacent property shall not be a factor in determining the availability of the adjacent property.
(i)
Conditions on approval. The zoning board of appeals may impose or require conditions, as may be necessary, to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community; to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhoods: and provided that wherever the board shall find, in the case of any approval, that any of the conditions upon which such approval was granted are not being complied with, said zoning board of appeals shall rescind and revoke such approval after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a hearing.
(j)
Limitation on re-applying. If the decision of the zoning board of appeals is to deny, an application which seeks the same relief in regard to the same property shall not be accepted for a period of 180 calendar days following the date of the decision from the zoning board of appeals.
