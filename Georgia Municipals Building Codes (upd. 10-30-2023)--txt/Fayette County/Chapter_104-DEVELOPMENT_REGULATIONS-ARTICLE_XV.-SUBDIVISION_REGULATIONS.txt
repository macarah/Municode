(a)
The regulations, specifications and procedures for the subdivision and subsequent development of land and for the platting thereof, prescribed and adopted by the ordinance from which this article is derived are hereby deemed by the board of commissioners to be desirable and necessary in order to help ensure the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare by means of harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of land. The board of commissioners' desire to provide this development framework to enable the property owners' reasonable reliance upon the manner in which subdivisions are developed. Further, the purposes of the regulations of the subdivision of land are, among others:
(1)
To encourage and ensure the development of economically sound and stable neighborhoods;
(2)
To ensure the adequate provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new land developments;
(3)
To ensure the provisions of reasonably safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian traffic access and circulation;
(4)
To ensure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservations of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes;
(5)
To ensure land is developed with reasonable safeguards for environmental protection;
(6)
To provide accurate, uniform records for identification and location of real estate boundaries; and
(7)
To ensure, in general, the wise development of new areas, in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the county.
(b)
The harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of land is further facilitated by recognizing a hierarchy among the ordinances and regulations which govern the development of land. To the extent a conflict exists between these subdivision regulations and the zoning ordinance of Fayette County the subdivision regulations shall control.

Proposed revisions to a recorded major final plat of any existing residential or agricultural-residential subdivisions which adds property to, increases the number of platted lots, or changes the principal use on a lot shall be considered in public hearings before the planning commission and the board of commissioners and public notification shall comply with section 110-301, Public notification. The following factors shall be considered by the planning and zoning department, the planning commission and the board of commissioners when reviewing these requests:
(i)
Street character. Whether the request will result in a residence or accessory structure that will be out of character with the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures. Aspects to consider are the front setback established on the final plat, the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures, the degree a proposed residence or accessory structure will be out of alignment with the setback and/or existing residences and accessory structures and the presence of vegetation (trees, bushes, shrubbery, etc.) which may provide visual screening.
(ii)
Lot size character. Whether the request will result in a lot that will be out of character with the size of existing lots. Aspects to consider are the lot width required by the zoning district, the minimum and maximum range of lots sizes, the number of lots within a size range, the average lot size and the degree proposed lots will be smaller than existing lots.
(iii)
Lot width character. Whether the request will result in a lot that will be out of character with the width of existing lots. Aspects to consider are the lot width required by the zoning district, the minimum and maximum range of lot widths, the lot widths within a range, the average lot width and the degree proposed lots will be more narrow than existing lots.
(iv)
Change of principal use. Whether the change of use will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property, will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing or planned streets, or utilities, or other conditions which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the change of use proposal.
3.
Amend setbacks increased by a condition of rezoning. This will be administered as a rezoning under article IX, Policies, Procedures and Standards Governing Amendments. The following additional factors shall be considered in these requests:
(i)
Street character. Whether the request will result in a residence or accessory structure that will be out of character with the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures. Aspects to consider are the front setback established on the final plat, the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures, the degree a proposed residence or accessory structure will be out of alignment with the setback and/or existing residences and accessory structures and the presence of vegetation (trees, bushes, shrubbery, etc.) which may provide visual screening.
(ii)
Side and rear setbacks. Whether the request will result in residence or accessory structure that will be out of character with the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures. Aspects to consider are the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures, the degree a proposed residence or accessory structure will be out of alignment with existing residences and accessory structures and the presence of vegetation (trees, bushes, shrubbery, etc.) which may provide visual screening.
4.
Amend setbacks increased by a developer on a major or minor final plat. Proposed revisions to a recorded final plat which reduce a setback increased by the developer shall be considered in public hearings before the planning commission. Notice of a scheduled public hearing shall be published at least 15 calendar days prior to the public hearing before the planning commission. One sign is required to be posted for each street frontage of the subject property at least 15 calendar days prior to the public hearing before the planning commission. A refundable sign deposit shall be required for each sign at the time of application. The following factors shall be considered by the planning commission when reviewing these requests:
(i)
Street character. Whether the request will result in a residence or accessory structure that will be out of character with the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures. Aspects to consider are the front setback established on the final plat, the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures, the degree a proposed residence or accessory structure will be out of alignment with the setback and/or existing residences and accessory structures and the presence of vegetation (trees, bushes, shrubbery, etc.) which may provide visual screening.
(ii)
Side and rear setbacks. Whether the request will result in residence or accessory structure that will be out of character with the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures. Aspects to consider are the alignment of existing residences and accessory structures, the degree a proposed residence or accessory structure will be out of alignment existing residences and accessory structures and the presence of vegetation (trees, bushes, shrubbery, etc.) which may provide visual screening.
i.
Minor revisions to a recorded final plat (major or minor). A minor revision to a recorded final plat such as the combination of lots, minor shifts to lot lines, corrections of errors and/or establishment or modification of an easement that does not increase the number of lots, change the use, alter the road or utility layout, or change the outer boundary of the final plat will be reviewed by the zoning administrator, Environmental Health and Environmental Management. Based on the nature of the minor revision, the zoning administrator may contact any other applicable departments for their input, as needed. See section 104-596 for requirements to be indicated on the minor revision of a final plat, as applicable.
j.
Dimensional requirements increased by a developer on a final plat (major or minor). Any dimensional requirements, e.g., setback, etc., specifically indicated on an approved final plat approved prior to May 28, 2020 (the effective date of this amendment) which is greater than a minimum zoning dimensional requirement shall control over the minimum zoning dimensional requirement. For example, a front yard setback indicated on an approved final plat that is greater than the requirement of the zoning district shall control. To the extent any future lot is sought to be added to the subdivision by subdividing an existing lot or adding property to the subdivision, the future lot(s) must comply with all requirements originally set out in the final plat. No consideration will be given for any dimensional requirement, or other issue, which is more lenient in the zoning district as compared to the final plat. All final plats (major or minor), which are not applicable to the regulation above, shall not be approved after May 28, 2020 (the effective date of this amendment) with a setback that is greater than the minimum setback of the applicable zoning district unless the setback was increased by a condition of rezoning. In addition, no final plats (major or minor) shall be amended to establish a setback that is greater than the minimum setback of the applicable zoning district originally indicated on the final plat.
k.
Requirements after the recordation of an approved final plat (major or minor). After the final plat has been recorded, the subdivider shall submit to the county the required number of recorded copies of the final plat, a digital media copy of the approved final plat, and a recorded deed for any right-of-way being donated to the county.
l.
Building permit. No permit for the construction of any building on any lot of a proposed subdivision or phase thereof shall be issued unless the final plat has been recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county, and unless the minimum site improvements, as prescribed in this article, have been made and such improvements have been inspected and approved by the applicable departments. Lots within a nonresidential subdivision shall also require an approved site plan, as applicable, for the issuance of a building permit.

The following design standards are in addition to applicable federal, state, and local ordinances, including, but not limited to: the county zoning ordinance, the county development regulations, and the county sign ordinance.
(1)
Subdivision access. Where the subdivision does not immediately access an existing public street (county or state owned and/or maintained), the subdivider shall provide access via a new public street or private street which complies with the minimum county standards to an existing public street. Any upgrades to existing public streets to provide adequate access to the subdivision shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. The county engineer or public works director shall determine if any necessary upgrades to the existing public streets are required prior to approving construction of the subdivision.
(2)
Easements. All easements shall be shown on the final plat and meet the following standards where applicable.
a.
Where possible, water lines shall be located outside the curb line on the west and south sides of streets; sewer and gas lines shall be on the east and north sides;
b.

  (4)
Corporate limits. Any lot divided by corporate limits (city or county) shall meet fully the requirements of Fayette County on the portion of the lot that is within unincorporated Fayette County for the purposes of a building permit. All corporate limits dividing a lot will be viewed in the same manner as a property line.
(5)
Street layout and design.
a.
Subdivision entrances and street length. No street or portion of a street may provide access to more than 75 lots unless 1) a second means of access to the lots is provided by another street; or 2) a two-way divided road is used at the entrance and extended to all points within the subdivision until the number of lots being served is 75 or less. Amenity and common areas (e.g., green space) are excluded from the 75-lot limit. Of the two options, use of a second means of access is preferred and shall be provided unless it is determined not feasible by the county engineer due to the lack of adequate road frontage, limited sight distance, or significant environmental constraints.
b.
Right-of-way. Any two-way divided entrance/road shall have a minimum 80-foot right-of-way, two 16-foot travel lanes, curb and gutter, and an 18-foot wide landscape island. Additional specifications for the divided entrance may be found in the development regulations.
c.
Corner lots. Corner property lines at street intersections shall have chamfer corners with minimum chamfer distances of 20 feet in each direction (chamfering means to connect two, non-parallel property lines with a third beveled line). The purpose of the chamfer is to allow sufficient room within the right-of-way for utility placement and maintenance.
d.
Curb radius. The curb radius at street intersections within subdivisions shall be no less than 25 feet. Curb radius requirements for intersections with collectors or arterial streets are dictated by the county development regulations and/or the state department of transportation.
e.
Dead-end streets, half-street and alleys. Dead-end streets, half-streets and alleys are prohibited. Temporary dead-end streets resulting from phased developments shall be constructed with a temporary turn-around.
f.
Elbows. Elbows (i.e., a circular bump-out of the paved road) may be used in lieu of a horizontal curve for road alignment when the centerline tangents have an intersection angle between 90 and 120 degrees. The "elbow" portion of the intersection shall be designed with a paved radius of 42 feet (to back-of-curb) and a 60-foot right-of-way radius. Elbows are not considered cul-de-sacs with respect to required road frontage for subdivision lots.
g.
Intersections. The center lines of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no intersection shall have an angle of less than 80 degrees. A tangent section no less than 50-feet long shall be placed between a centerline curve and the nearest right-of-way line of the street with which it intersects.
h.
Stub street. Where it is necessary to provide a street for future connection to an adjacent property, such street shall be constructed in conjunction with the subdivision up to the property line creating a stub street. Said stub street shall be indicated on the preliminary plat and final plat and labeled "Temporary Stub Street." Connecting stub streets shall maintain the same name and be terminated with a temporary turnaround as necessary.
(6)
Subdivision names. A proposed subdivision name shall not duplicate the name of another subdivision unless such property is contiguous and internally connected by a street to the subdivision bearing the proposed name and with the same or more restrictive zoning. In addition to meeting the above criteria, the sharing of a subdivision name must be approved by the planning commission. Whenever a new subdivision is permitted by the planning commission to share the name of a previously approved subdivision, such name shall be followed by the appropriate Roman Numerals (e.g., II). Any subsequent subdivisions approved by the planning commission under these provisions shall be numbered in sequence with Roman Numerals.
(7)
Additional right-of-way. If the subdivision boundary lies adjacent to the right-of-way line of an existing public street of less than minimum needed right-of-way width, as determined by the county thoroughfare plan, a minimum of one-half the required extra width shall be dedicated, at no cost, to the county by the subdivider.
(8)
Provisions for public use. In subdividing land, due consideration shall be given to suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other common areas for public use. Such land shall be located in accordance with the comprehensive plan. The acquisition of such land shall rest with the proper authority.

  Cost differentials based on line sizes and fire hydrants needed to serve a subdivision versus that needed as part of the overall system will be determined by the water system.
(f)
Fire hydrants. Standard fire hydrants will be provided at the spacing specified by chapter 12, Fire Prevention and Protection. Design standards shall be as specified by the American Water Works Association.
(g)
Sanitary sewer. When a public sewage disposal system is not available, the county environmental health department shall review the preliminary and final plat (major or minor) to determine the feasibility for individual on-site sewage disposal systems. After approval of the final plat (major or minor), on-site sewage disposal system permit applications must be submitted to the county environmental health department for each individual lot for review and approval. Per the Environmental Health Department, if the lots of a subdivision are to be served by individual subsurface wells, the on-site sewage disposal permit application must indicate the location of the well and on-site sewage disposal system. The subsurface well must be setback at least 100 feet from any on-site sewage disposal system and drainfields.
(h)
Stormwater drainage. The subdivider shall provide adequate stormwater drainage in accordance with all applicable county regulations and specifications.
(i)

However, proper temporary erosion control measures and performance bonds can be substituted for a permanent stand of grass during the final plat inspection.
(j)
Approval of permits. Building permits may be issued for a phase of a subdivision prior to the completion of the improvements in the entire subdivision, provided that the applicable departments approves the improvements in said phase and it is determined that the lots to be built upon are completely served by the improvements in the completed phase as if it were a separate subdivision.
(k)
Utilities. The subdivider shall provide all applicable utilities to the subdivision in accordance with all applicable county requirements. The utilities shall be located as specified by the development regulations. Power and water utilities must be installed, if available in the area, prior to final plat approval.

(1)
Paving the top layer (top course) of asphalt on one or more roads within the subdivision; and/or
(2)
Meeting permanent stabilization requirements within the proposed right-of-way.
Other than those items listed above, all minimum improvements within the subdivision shall be completed and accepted in accordance with the approved construction plans, the county development regulations, and the subdivision regulations prior to the recordation of a final plat, acceptance shall be determined by the county engineer, the director of utilities, and the environmental management director based on a field inspection of the project and/or review of required submittals. Work to be completed after the recordation of a major final plat shall be guaranteed by either a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit and the documents shall be filed with the county engineer prior to his signature on the major final plat.
(b)
Criteria for performance bonds or irrevocable letter of credit for paving. The amount of the bond or irrevocable letter-of-credit needed for paving shall be the sum of material, labor, equipment, and repair estimates, as determined by the county engineer, using the following guidelines:
(1)
Material costs equal 150 percent of current cost estimate for tack and asphalt;
(2)
Labor and equipment equals 20 percent of material costs; and
(3)
Repairs to binder and base equals 20 percent of material cost.
Additional costs shall be included for unusual circumstances. Performance bonds/irrevocable letters of credit for paving shall be considered only if coring of the asphalt binder and base, as required by the development regulations, demonstrate the work was completed per the approved construction plans and county standards. Paving work shall be completed within two years of recording the major final plat unless an extension is provided by the county engineer. The bonds/irrevocable letters of credit shall not be released until all repairs and paving work are done in accordance with the approved construction plans and the work is accepted by the county engineer.
(c)
Criteria for performance bonds for permanent stabilization. The amount of the performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit needed for permanent stabilization shall be the sum of material, labor, equipment, and repair estimates, as determined by the environmental management department. At a minimum, the cost estimate shall include all best management practices required to bring the project into compliance with the approved soil erosion and sediment control plan. Additional costs may be included for unusual circumstances. Performance bonds/irrevocable letters of credit for stabilization will be considered only if the environmental management director determines that current weather patterns and the season make permanent stabilization infeasible at this time. Stabilization work shall be completed within one year of recording the major final plat. The performance bonds/irrevocable letters of credit shall not be released until all areas of concern are stabilized in accordance with the approved construction plans and the work is accepted by the environmental management director.

Maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit. The subdivider shall provide to the county engineer, a maintenance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit for the purpose of guaranteeing the materials and workmanship of the minimum improvements for a period of two years. For purposes of bond/irrevocable letter of credit determination, "minimum improvements" includes all materials and work within the proposed right-of-way plus any part of the storm sewer infrastructure serving the subdivision. This includes, but is not limited to: storm pipe, open ditches, headwalls, stormwater management ponds, etc. The subdivider shall be responsible for making any needed repairs to the road or other "minimum improvements" as defined above within the two-year bonding period. Notification of needed repairs may be provided by the county to the subdivider at any time during the bonding period. If the subdivider does not make the necessary repairs within 90 calendar days of said notification, the county engineer shall claim funds from the bond or irrevocable letter of credit to adequately reimburse the county for its cost associated with having the repairs made by a contractor or the appropriate county department. Regardless of project size, the minimum maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit is $5,000.00. If a final plat becomes void, as may happen if not recorded into the county clerk of superior court records within 90 calendar days of approval by the planning commission, the existing maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit is also void and a new maintenance bond/irrevocable letter of credit will be required prior to approval of the new final plat.
