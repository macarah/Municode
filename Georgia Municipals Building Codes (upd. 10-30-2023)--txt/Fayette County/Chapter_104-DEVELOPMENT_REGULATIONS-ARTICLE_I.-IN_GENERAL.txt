(Code 1992, § 8-3; Ord. No. 98-01, § 1, 1-14-1998; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 1, 8-26-2010)
Sec. 104-4. - Wetlands protection.
(a)
Jurisdictional wetlands are areas that meet the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Jurisdictional wetlands determination is a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. Any development project which, in the determination of the county stormwater management department, will disturb any wetlands area, either indicated on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps or by field determination of the county stormwater management director, must be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a jurisdictional wetlands determination and permit if necessary.
(b)
The NWI maps are on display in the county stormwater management department. If the official determination by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers indicates that jurisdictional wetlands will be affected/altered by the proposed activity, the applicant must obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to the issuance of any permits from the county. The NWI map does not represent all of the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. No local government action under this chapter relieves the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.
