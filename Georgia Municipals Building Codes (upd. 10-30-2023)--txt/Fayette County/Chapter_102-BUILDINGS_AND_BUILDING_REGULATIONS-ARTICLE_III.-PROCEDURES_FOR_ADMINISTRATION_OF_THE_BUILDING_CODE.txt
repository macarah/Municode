Sec. 102-165. - Applicability.
The provisions of this article apply to the International Building Code, as adopted in section 102-22. In this article the term "building code" means the International Building Code as adopted in section 102-22.
(Code 1992, § 5-101; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 3, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-166. - Scope.
(a)
Applicability. The provisions of the building code shall apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or structures.
(b)
Exception. Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (townhouses) not more than three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall comply with the International Residential Code.

Sec. 102-167. - Intent.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the building code is to establish the minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment and to provide safety to firefighters and emergency responders during emergency operations. The purpose of the building code is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by the terms of the building code.
(b)
Public duty, warranty and quality control. The permitting, plans examination or inspection conducted with regard to a building or structure in accordance with the building code constitutes a public duty and does not warrant or ensure the absence of any hazard, deficiency or other matter. Any duty created by or based on the building code is transferred to the public, and no private cause of action is created by a breach of such duty. The building code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person, firm or corporation owning, operating or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the department of building safety or the county be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections or plans examinations authorized by the building code or any permits or certificates issued under the building code. The building official checks for substantial compliance with the building code, but reviews and inspections performed by the building official pursuant to this Chapter do not create any guarantee or warranty that buildings, structures or service equipment have been constructed in accordance with all provisions of the building code. The permitting, plans examination, or inspection of any building, structure, system, element, or construction document shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition or adequacy of such building, structure, system, element, or construction document, including without limitation a representation or warranty that a building or structure is complete, that it is in compliance with the building code or any other law, that it was inspected, that it is safe or ready for occupancy or that it meets any particular degree of quality or workmanship. Quality control of materials and workmanship is not within the purview of the building code except as it relates to the purposes stated therein. The amount and quality of inspection and other services provided is discretionary with the building official and may vary in response to the amount of staff, work load, training and experience, funding and other pertinent factors affecting whether and how inspection is made or whether any hazard, deficiency or similar matter is observed.
