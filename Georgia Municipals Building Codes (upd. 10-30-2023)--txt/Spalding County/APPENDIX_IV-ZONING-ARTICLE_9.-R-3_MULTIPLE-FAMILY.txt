Sec. 904. - Plan review and approval procedures.
A.
Pre-application conference: Prior to filing a formal application for an R-3, the applicant shall confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
B.
Submission of application for R-3 approval:
1.
The applicant must file a petition with the administrative officer for approval of the proposed R-3. This application must be supported by a site development plan and a written plan of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. Eight (8) copies of the site development plan and written plan of intent must accompany the application. The site development plan consists of a series of drawings which must show the following:
a.
A general location map.
b.
The site development plan shall be drawn at a scale suitable to show the extent of the proposed development. North arrow and correct scale will be shown on all drawings. Scales of one (1) inch = one hundred (100) feet are acceptable.
c.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five (5) feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods.
d.
The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures. All lot lines and setbacks documenting compliance must be shown.
e.
The approximate location of existing and proposed streets and driveways. Rights-of-way and pavement widths shall be shown.
f.
The location of all existing and proposed utilities and easements, including, but not limited to, water, sanitary sewage, stormwater drainage, natural gas, electricity and cable TV lines.
g.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
h.
A legal description of the subject property.
i.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semi-public, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
j.
Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings.
k.
A preliminary stormwater drainage plan prepared and stamped by a registered professional engineer.
2.
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances as determined by the administrative officer and planning commission, additional information shall be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows:
a.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
c.
A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site.
d.
Additional studies or reports as required.
3.
The written plan of intent must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development. Provide financial statement of developer that indicates the ability to develop and complete proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use.
c.
A development and construction time schedule showing major activities of proposed development.
d.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
e.
Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development and any common or open areas.
C.
Review and approval of R-3 application: An application for approval of an R-3 is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because R-3 districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed R-3. Upon approval of the R-3, existing zoning must be changed to an R-3 zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in Sections 414 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the R-3. Approval of R-3 zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.
1.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the R-3 district (Section 2302). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
2.
The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer.
3.
No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners.
D.
Issuance of building permits: The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 408.)
E.
Revision of development plan after approval of plan:
1.
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of Sections 414 and 2302. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
