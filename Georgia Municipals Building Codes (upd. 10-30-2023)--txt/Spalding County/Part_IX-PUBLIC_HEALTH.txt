CHAPTER 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 9-1001. - Policy on indigent sick approvals for hospital care.
(a)
General.
(1)
Applications must be verified before final approvals are given. Approval will be in writing with copies to all interested parties.
(2)
Indigent cases, except emergencies, must be approved before admission to hospital. There will be no retroactive approvals except emergencies.
(3)
Emergency cases must be reported to approving agent within twenty-four (24) hours after admission to the hospital if they are considered for approval as indigent, except when emergency cases enter the hospital on a Saturday or a Sunday. Such Saturday or Sunday cases must be submitted to the approving agent for investigation by 9:00 a.m. on the following Tuesday.
(4)
Except in the case of approvals for "outpatient" treatment, each hospital admission as an indigent will require a separate application and approval.
(5)
An "indigent" person as used herein shall be construed to mean any person, residing in Spalding County, who is ill or injured and is in need of hospital care and who from his own resources or from the resources of those upon whom he is legally dependent, is financially unable to meet the full costs of hospital care as prescribed or ordered by a physician. An allegedly indigent person shall not be considered "indigent" hereunder if any of the following conditions exist:
a.
If either he or a person upon whom he is legally dependent is financially able to pay for his hospital care and, in any case, only to the extent of such hospital care for which he or those upon whom he is legally dependent are unable to pay;
b.
If he or any one (1) or more of those upon whom he is legally dependent own a home or have an equity in a home, exceeding twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00);
c.
If he owns a motor vehicle or an equity therein which has a market value in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00); or
d.
If he has a stereo-record player, a television set, a motorcycle, an airplane, or other such items, which may be considered nonessential by the governing authority of Spalding County, having a market value in aggregate in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or if he is making installment payments for the purchase of any such items.
(b)
Insurance.
(1)
No portion of any hospital bill for hospital care furnished anyone shall be regarded as an indigent case to the extent covered by any type of insurance or any federal, state, or other local programs for such indigent person.
(2)
The term "hospital care" as used herein shall be construed to mean only the nonprofit, basic costs of hospital care needed for the treatment for the ill or injured, as deemed necessary and ordered by the physician in charge of the case in accordance with the rules, regulations and standards adopted and promulgated by the hospital, and shall be only the hospital care that is not available under any other program, federal, state or local.
(c)
Pregnancy.
(1)
As a general rule, pregnancy or childbirth will not be approved as an indigent case because there is ample time to make some arrangements to handle the financial obligation. If such a patient is clearly to be an indigent case, it must be reported by the doctor, patient or health clinic at least three (3) months in advance or as soon as the initial contact is made between the patient and the doctor or health clinic.
(2)
No illegitimate pregnancy or childbirth will be approved as indigent unless the doctor, health clinic and/or the hospital notifies the approving agent in strict accordance with the above paragraph (1); and, further, that cooperation is extended to bring the putative father to justice by making him face his financial obligation under the law, and that the expectant mother swears out a warrant against the man she names as the father of the child. The county investigator should be called for assistance in these cases.
(d)
Doctors. Spalding County assumes no liability for physicians' bills or hospital resident physicians' fees.
(Ord. of 2-17-76)

Persons in the county shall be hospitalized only under the medical admission provisions of Chapter 88-5 of the Code of Georgia (1933), as amended. (E-297, 12-30-70)
