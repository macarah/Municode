ARTICLE 22B. - TCC TRI COUNTY CROSSING OVERLAY DISTRICT[9]

Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
Editor's note— The figures referenced in this article are not set out at length herein, but are on file in the offices of the county.

Sec. 2201B. - Purpose.
The Tri County Crossing area of Spalding County, consisting of property located near the intersection of U.S. Highway 19/41 and Zebulon Road, is an important crossroad and emerging commercial center in Spalding County. Through the Atlanta Regional Commission's Livable Centers Initiative, Spalding County developed the Tri County Crossing LCI Plan, adopted in March 2009, which articulated a future vision for the development of this area. The plan seeks to create a focused and walkable mixed-use center integrating commercial, employment and residential uses. The Tri County Crossing Overlay District (TCC) implements the vision for this area set forth in the Tri-County Crossing LCI Plan by guiding development to: create a vibrant pedestrian-oriented area, establish better connectivity to surrounding neighborhoods, protect and enhance public open spaces, encourage mixed-use development and a range of housing options, and maximize connectivity and mobility of all types.
The TCC District identifies important and required new street connections which will be built as development occurs. It will create a connected system of streets and blocks that manage and distribute vehicular traffic and ensure a pattern of walkable pedestrian-oriented streets. Street design standards ensure that future streets will encourage walking and cycling and provide valuable public spaces.
The TCC District includes Development Standards that ensure pedestrian-oriented design. Buildings are sited close to streets with active ground floor use and pedestrian amenities. A range of housing options is permitted and encouraged in order to create a mixed-use center where housing and services are located within walking distance of each other. The resulting development pattern will better utilize land, protect open space, manage traffic congestion, and create lasting community value.

3.
Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of any side of a building adjoining a parking lot, designed according to the SECONDARY DRIVEWAY standards outlined in Figure 2D.
F.
Building design.
1.
General building design requirements.
a.
Building orientation. Buildings shall have their primary entrance for pedestrians visible and directly accessible from the street and sidewalk, including, but limited to, dwelling units, multi-family lobbies, and individual business establishments. This entrance shall be open to the public during business hours.
b.
Building mass and scale. Building facades shall include vertical bays articulated such that no more than sixty (60) feet of horizontal distance of wall shall be constructed without architectural relief a minimum of thirty (30) feet wide and one (1) foot deep.
c.
Building materials. The first two (2) stories of building facades shall be constructed of a minimum of eighty-five (85) percent of brick, cast stone, concrete siding such as Hardiplank, natural wood or stone material, exclusive of windows and doors.
2.
Residential facade treatment. Residential buildings shall have a RESIDENTIAL FACADE TREATMENT on the ground floor facade along the length of the required STREET FACADE FRONTAGE. This treatment shall include:
a.
An entry stoop or porch at the primary pedestrian entrance.
b.
Windows for a minimum of thirty (30) percent and a maximum of sixty (60) percent of the length of the built portion of the STREET FACADE FRONTAGE.
c.
Acceptable building materials shall include brick, cast stone, concrete siding such as Hardiplank, natural wood or stone materials, or stucco, excluding vinyl siding.
3.
Storefront facade treatment. Commercial and mixed-use buildings shall have a STOREFRONT FACADE TREATMENT on the ground floor facade along the length of the required STREET FACADE FRONTAGE. Standards for this treatment shall include:
a.
Corner building entrances for buildings on corner lots.
b.
A non-glass base or knee wall beginning at grade and extending to a point no less than eight (8) inches but no more than twenty-four (24) inches above the sidewalk.
c.
A glass display window a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the length of the built portion of the STREET FACADE FRONTAGE.
d.
Provides no length of facade exceeding twenty (20) feet without intervening glass display windows.
e.
A clear visual division shall be maintained between the ground floor and upper floors with either a cornice line or awning from twelve (12) to sixteen (16) feet above the base floor elevation.
f.
Awnings shall be of fabrics, canvas, fixed metal, or similar material. Internally lit awnings and canopies that emit light through the awning or canopy material are prohibited.
g.
Acceptable building materials shall include brick, cast stone, stucco, concrete or stone materials, excluding vinyl siding.
4.
Mechanical and service area screening.
a.
Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC equipment, trash dumpsters/compactors, and other service functions shall not be visible from any street or sidewalk or adjacent residential area.
b.
These facilities shall be incorporated into the overall design of the principal building using screening walls of compatible material, style, color, texture, pattern, trim and detail.
c.
Screening walls shall be one (1) foot higher than the highest object being screened, but not more than ten (10) feet high. An opaque gate, with the same height as the wall, shall be included where access is needed.
d.
Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of the building such that it is not visible from any street or sidewalk or adjacent residential area.
e.
Mechanical equipment shall be screened from view by fencing, evergreen vegetation, or walls.
5.
Exterior lighting.
a.
The purpose of these criteria is to create standards for outdoor lighting which will provide nighttime safety, security and utility, while reducing light pollution and light trespass, and increase conservation of energy. Any lighting used to illuminate parking areas, access drives or loading areas shall be of such a design or level of illumination so as to minimize the amount of ambient lighting perceptible from adjacent properties and that would impair the vision of motorists.
b.
Lighting poles mounted on private property outside of public street rights-of-way may not exceed a height of sixteen (16) feet.
c.
Accent lighting for building facades and other vertical structures shall be directed solely onto the building or structure and not toward the sky or onto adjacent properties. Direct light emissions shall not be visible above the roofline or beyond the building's edge. Shielding shall be provided to restrict light to the object being accented.
d.
All pole mounted fixtures shall be mounted parallel to the ground. Building mounted floodlights shall be direct cutoff type and set parallel to the ground.
e.
Lighting for uses adjacent to residentially zoned property shall be designed and maintained such that illumination levels do not exceed 1.0 foot-candle along property lines, measured at ground level by a light meter certified by its manufacturer as being calibrated in accordance with standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
f.
The use of search lights, laser lighting, or lights that pulse, flash, rotate or simulate motion for advertising or promotions is prohibited.
g.
Any wall or pole-mounted light fixture shall be a cutoff luminaire whose source is completely concealed with an opaque housing and shall not be visible from any street.
h.

6.
Signs. Minimum design and location standards for signs are contained in the Spalding County Sign Ordinance (Appendix E). Consult that document for specific requirements.
