PREFACE
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS, a division of Public Research and Management, Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia, is pleased to publish this Code of Ordinances of Spalding County, Georgia. This volume contains laws of local application and County ordinances.
The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal, or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the County.
The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the index of statutes and the index of ordinances at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter.
Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part I of the Code that applies to the entire Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as State law references and cross references have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions.
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of laws and ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated.
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS offers a full range of services to supplement this Code and to keep it current. It is published in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be printed for inclusion on a regular basis. A periodic update-supplement service is available and may be secured through an agreement between the County and PRM. The County would send new ordinances and amendments to PRM, which would print replacement pages for the Code. Also, PRM will supplement the sections on State laws as amendments or new enactments occur in the General Assembly or by home rule amendment.
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the County officials in the preparation of this Code.

  Addendum
Commencing with Supplement No. 2 to this Code in 1983, periodic updates have been provided by the Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida. Following the publication of Supplement No. 13 in December of 1993, the County authorized a reprinting of the entire Code including amendments and changes enacted by ordinances and legislation passed through December 1994. This reproduction constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code, and future supplements will commence with Supplement No. 1.
The reproduction of this Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, with the assistance of Felecia D. Wilson, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

  An Ordinance of the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, Adopting and Enacting a New Code for Spalding County, Georgia; Establishing the Same; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances not Included Therein, Except as Herein Expressly Provided; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; Providing When This Ordinance Shall Become Effective; Providing Certain Penalties; and for Other Purposes.
Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, and it is Hereby Ordained by Authority of the Same as Follows:
Section 1. The document entitled "The Code of Spalding County, Georgia," a copy whereof accompanies this ordinance and is incorporated herein and made a part hereof, consisting of Parts I through XI and Appendices I to III, each inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted as the "Code of Spalding County, Georgia," and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all other general and permanent ordinances passed by the Board of Commissioners prior to February 15, 1977, except such as by reference thereto are expressly saved from repeal or continued in force and effect for any purpose.
Section 2. All provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect on and after February 15, 1977, and all ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of Spalding County enacted on final passage on or before February 15, 1977, and not in such Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided.
Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution of the County promising or guaranteeing the payment of money by or to the County, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the County, or any evidence of the County's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the County; nor shall such repeal affect any rights or franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the Board of Commissioners to any person, firm or corporation; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the County; nor shall such repeal affect the annual appropriation of the County, nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution levying or imposing license fees or taxes; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution providing for local improvements and assessing taxes therefor; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution relating to the building regulations of the County including the electrical and plumbing regulations; nor shall such repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance or resolution which is repealed by this ordinance.
Section 4. Any and all additions or amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated into such Code so that reference to the "Code of Spalding County, Georgia", shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments.
Section 5. A copy of such Code shall be kept on file in the office of the Clerk, and preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the Clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the Clerk or someone authorized by her, to insert in their designated places all amendments, ordinances or resolutions which indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of such Code, when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the Board of Commissioners. This copy of such Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same and shall be considered the official Code of Spalding County.
Section 6  As pages of the Code are replaced because the matter contained on them shall have been repealed, amended, or otherwise shall have been superseded or rendered obsolete or inoperative, the Clerk shall retain copies of such pages of the Code so superseded, rendered obsolete or otherwise rendered inoperative in a file for the purpose so that the former provisions of the Code may be readily available and easily found. The purpose of this section is to permit anyone desiring to do so to ascertain the precise status of any section of the Code as of any given date.
Section 7. In case of the amendment of any section of such Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in Section 1-1007 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.
Section 8. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation in Spalding County to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which may cause the law of Spalding County to be misrepresented thereby.
Section 9. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed.
Section 10. This ordinance shall be in force and take effect on February 15, 1977.
Adopted this 15th day of February, 1977.
