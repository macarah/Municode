C.
Easements will allow designated open space to be used for community sewer system drip lines or individual septic system secondary drain lines, wells, and storm water management structures designed to promote on-site infiltration and/or treatment of runoff if the designated open space has been designated for maintenance by a home owners association in accordance with section 1712.A(1).
