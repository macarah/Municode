ARTICLE 21B. - S-4 SENSITIVE LAND-WETLANDS PROTECTION DISTRICT

Sec. 2101B. - Purpose.
The purpose of the S-4 district is to protect those lands identified as wetlands. Wetland areas are those areas that are flooded or saturated by surface or groundwater often and long enough to grow vegetation adapted for life in water saturated soil. The wetlands in Spalding County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia. A considerable number of important wetland natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piece meal or cumulative losses of wetlands will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The purpose of the S-4 district is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2102B. - Relationship to other zoning districts.
S-4 wetlands protection district is an overlay district which shall include all lands within the jurisdiction of Spalding County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the wetlands map and it is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The S-4 wetlands protection district applies additional definitions and standards for development to specific areas which lie within any of the zoning districts identified in this ordinance and which are additionally mapped as wetland areas, as shown on the wetlands map.
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01).
Sec. 2103B. - Definitions.
The following definitions (in addition to those definitions contained within Article 2 of this Ordinance) apply to S-4 districts:
A.
Corps of Engineers: The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which is given authority pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, for the regulation of wetlands and the permitting of fill material therein.
B.
Wetlands: Any areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. The definition of "wetlands," as defined in 33 C.F.R. 32.93 is included within this definition, and adopted by reference.
C.
Wetlands map: The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Spalding County, Georgia.
D.
Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the Corps of Engineers.
E.
Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, as amended.
F.
Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2104B. - Coordination with development criteria contained in other zoning districts.
A.
The provisions of this article apply additional development standards to specific areas which may lie within any zoning district in Spalding County. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both articles, the more stringent governs.
B.
Any development must comply with the Spalding County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance, as well as any other applicable development regulation.
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2105B. - Adoption of Spalding County Wetlands Protection District Map.
A.
The S-4 wetlands protection district consists of and shall correspond to the area located within the wetland protection areas as are shown and designated on a certain map identified as the "S-4 District, Spalding County Wetland Protection Map," which map is hereby adopted into and made a part of this ordinance as if fully set forth. Such map shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County and bear the seal of the county or that of a Notary Public under the following words: "This certifies that this is the Official S-4 District Spalding County Wetlands Protection Map," referred to in Article 21B of the Zoning Ordinance of Spalding County.
B.
The area identified as lying within the S-4 wetlands protection district shall be the same as that area lying within the boundaries of Spalding County shown on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory. To the extent of a conflict between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory and the Official S-4 District Spalding County Wetland Protection Map, the provisions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory shall control.
C.
The boundaries of the S-4 wetlands protection district, as shown on the Official S-4 District Spalding County Wetlands Protection Map do not necessarily represent the complete boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Spalding County. Further, the boundaries of wetlands as shown on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory do not necessarily represent the complete boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands in Spalding County. The boundaries shown on such maps do not substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
D.
Any action required by this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from complying with any and all applicable federal or state permitting requirements.
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2106B. - Permits and protection criteria.
Requirement for local permit: No regulated activity will be permitted within the S-4 wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from Spalding County. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of the boundary of the S-4 wetlands protection district, as determined by the building official or designated appointee using the S-4 district, Spalding County Wetlands Protection Map, a determination by the corps of engineers shall be required. If the Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
