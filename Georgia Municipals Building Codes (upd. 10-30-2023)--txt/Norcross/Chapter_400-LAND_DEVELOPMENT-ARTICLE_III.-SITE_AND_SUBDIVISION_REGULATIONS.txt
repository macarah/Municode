(4)
If an applicant is proposing to build a development that is already in compliance with the provisions of the UDO and does not have to seek approval of a rezoning or special use permit (SUP), then the concept plan may be approved by the Community Development Director. The concept plan may be submitted as part of the application for preliminary plat approval.
(b)
Review process.
(1)
Step 1: The developer of a proposed subdivision shall meet with the UDO Administrator in a preapplication review to discuss what is required for concept plan approval in terms of documents, fees and schedules.

(6)
Step 6: If the UDO Administrator concludes that the concept plan is acceptable, meets the requirements of the UDO, and that no rezoning or SUP is required, the concept plan will be approved.
