ARTICLE XIII. - LAWYERS AND LAW FIRMS

Sec. 12-350. - Scope and levy.
(a)
It is the intent of the city that the tax imposed in this section is for revenue purposes only. The city expressly acknowledges that it cannot regulate the practice of law, and no portion of this article shall be construed in such a manner as to constitute the regulation of the practice of law. The city further expressly recognizes that the regulation of the practice of law is the exclusive province of the state supreme court and its authorized representatives. Further, it is not the intent of this section to impose any precondition upon the practice of law. In keeping with these principles, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-6 et seq., all persons, including professional corporations, engaged in the practice of law in the city are hereby required to pay the amount now or hereafter fixed as the occupation tax thereon.
(b)
Persons practicing law in the city but not maintaining an office in the city.
(1)
The provisions of this article shall apply to those persons practicing law with no location or office in the city if the person:
a.
Has one (1) or more employees or agents who exert substantial efforts within the city for the purpose of soliciting business or serving clients; or
b.
Owns personal or real property which generates income related to the practice of law and which is located in the city.
(2)
In no event shall a person practicing law subject to this subsection be required to pay an occupation tax to more than one (1) local government in the state and then only to the local government in which the largest dollar volume of business is done or service is performed by the person.
(3)
If a person subject to this subsection provides to the business registration division proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state, or county or municipality of this state which purports to tax the practitioner's services in this state, the practitioner shall be exempt for the levy of any occupational tax under this section.
(Ord. No. 2017-010 , § 1, 5-1-17)
Sec. 12-351. - Attorneys not required to register.
(a)
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this chapter, an attorney shall not be required to register with the business registration division. Information reported with any occupation tax payment may be retained by the business registration division and used for those purposes allowed by applicable law.
(b)
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this chapter, an attorney shall not be required to obtain, display, or maintain any city issued certificate showing that any payment or information has been submitted to the business registration division.
(c)
For the purposes of enforcement of the zoning ordinance, attorneys may be asked to submit notarized affidavits or other written information concerning the business or profession carried on at a location and the dates of operation when applying for a certificate of occupancy for new construction or renovation. Such affidavits or documents shall be used for the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning ordinance and shall not prevent the practice of the profession of law at any other location which has a valid certificate of occupancy.
(d)
A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The business registration division manager may document this refusal. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the county shall direct the notices to the address listed with the state bar and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service.

(a)
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, an attorney shall not be required to pay the occupation tax on the income generated from the practice of law prior to or during the calendar year in which it is earned. Rather, the occupation tax for the preceding calendar year shall be due January 1 of the following year and payable without interest accrued until February 1 at which time the tax will be delinquent and accrue interest. The tax may be paid in person at the business registration division or by mailing the tax to the business registration division. Any tax payment made by mail shall include the name and address of the person or law firm paying the tax and the name of each attorney whose tax is being paid, so that the business registration division may process the payment. An attorney who pays the occupation tax on his own behalf shall include the name of the law firm with which he practices, if any. Any tax paid pursuant to the option of subsection 12-353(1) shall include a written submission containing sufficient information to enable the business license division manager to determine the accuracy of the taxpayer's calculation.

Sec. 12-362. - Option of the business registration division manager to send bills.
(a)
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the business registration division manager may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the state bar as being located in the city.
(b)
An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the four hundred dollars ($400.00) per practitioner fee unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The business registration division manager is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the state bar in connection with the directives of State Bar Rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of interest should the business registration division manager deny the request for adjustment.

(d)
The business registration division manager may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from three (3) other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the business registration division manager to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due.

(1)
When the business registration division manager has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to business registration division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, he or she shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the state bar for investigation as to whether a violation of the state rules of professional conduct has occurred.

Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged misrepresentations shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys, and neither this article nor any other portion of the ordinances of the city authorize any civil fine or associated contempt charges for failure to comply with this article.
