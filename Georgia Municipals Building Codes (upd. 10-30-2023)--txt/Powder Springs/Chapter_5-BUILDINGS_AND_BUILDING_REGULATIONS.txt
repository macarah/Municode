No excavating or trenching shall be performed until a permit or authorization for same has been obtained from the city. Any applicant will be required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of safety requirements before any permit will be issued. All such permits shall be conspicuously posted upon the jobsite. No such permit shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing before the mayor and council after notice to the permit holder of the date, time and place of hearing, along with notice of the charges. Due cause shall consist of the violating of any laws or ordinances regulating excavating or trenching. Three (3) days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the mayor and council may deem the circumstances to justify. At such hearing, the permit-holder shall be entitled to be represented by an attorney, to cross-examine any witnesses who may appear against him, and to present evidence in his own behalf.
No permit or authorization shall be issued unless an authorized agent of the applicant holds a certificate.
