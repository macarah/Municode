Chapter 15.5 - MUNICIPAL COURT[1]
Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— It should be noted that O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1 et seq. provides for the establishment of municipal courts; hence, the term recorder's court has been changed to municipal court and the term recorder has been changed to municipal court judge. Formerly set out as ch. 22, §§ 22-1—22-4, provisions pertaining to such court have been transferred to ch. 15.5, §§ 15.5-1—15.5-4 in order to preserve alphabetical sequence of chapter titles in the Code. Where the term recorder's court appears throughout the Code it will be changed to municipal court as pages are necessarily affected through the supplement service.
