Sec. 23-54. - Wastewater discharge permit transfer.
Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least thirty (30) days' advance notice to the utilities director and the utilities director approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer.

(2)
Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and

(e)
Persons living outside municipalities and desiring sewer service shall install and maintain, at their expense, water meters of a type approved by the city for the purpose of measuring the volume of water being used by that residence or industry.
