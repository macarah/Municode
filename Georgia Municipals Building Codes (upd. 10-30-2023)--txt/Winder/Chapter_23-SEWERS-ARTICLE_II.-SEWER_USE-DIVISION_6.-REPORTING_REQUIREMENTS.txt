DIVISION 6. - REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 23-61. - Baseline monitoring reports.
(a)
Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the utilities director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the utilities director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
(b)
Users described above shall submit the information set forth below:
(1)
Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner.
(2)
Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility.
(3)
Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description shall include the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
(4)
Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(5)
Measurement of pollutants.
a.
The user shall provide the information required in section 23-45 of this article.
b.
The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
c.
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority.
d.
The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 23-70 of this article.
e.
Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 23-71 of this article.
(6)
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(7)
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 23-62 of this article.
(8)
Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 23-74 of this article.

Sec. 23-63. - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the utilities director a report containing the information described in section 23-61(b)(4) through (6) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 23-46 of this article.
(Ord. (7-W-96) of 6-13-96; Ord. ( (W-5-20) ) of 12-8-20, § I)
Sec. 23-64. - Periodic compliance reports.
(a)
All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the utilities director, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the utilities director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(b)
The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. [see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)] This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(1)
The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
(2)
The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
(3)
In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
(4)
The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 23-74, and include the certification statement in 23-74.
(5)
Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(6)
Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the utilities director must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the utilities director for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver.
(7)
Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the utilities director the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in section 23-74, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user.
(8)
In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of section 23-64, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the utilities director and notify the utilities director.
(9)
This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
(c)
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 23-74 of this article.
(d)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(e)
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the utilities director, using the procedures prescribed in section 23-71 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. (7-W-96) of 6-13-96; Ord. ( (W-5-20) ) of 12-8-20, § XIV)
Sec. 23-65. - Reports of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the utilities director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
(1)
The utilities director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 23-45 of this article.
(2)
The utilities director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 23-47 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 23-54 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3)
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(Ord. (7-W-96) of 6-13-96; Ord. ( (W-5-20) ) of 12-8-20, § I)
Sec. 23-66. - Reports of potential problems.
(a)
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the utilities director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b)
Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the utilities director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
(c)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(d)
Significant industrial users are required to notify the utilities director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

Sec. 23-69. - Prohibition of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
The discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261, is prohibited.
(b)
The discharge into the POTW of a substance which, although not a hazardous waste in the concentrations at which it is discharged, accumulates in treatment plant sludges to an extent sufficient to cause the plant sludge to be classified a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261, is prohibited.
(Ord. (7-W-96) of 6-13-96)
Sec. 23-70. - Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the utilities director or other parties approved by EPA.
(Ord. (7-W-96) of 6-13-96; Ord. ( (W-5-20) ) of 12-8-20, § XVII)
Sec. 23-71. - Sample collection.
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(a)
Except as indicated in section (b) and (c) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by utilities director. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(c)
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports required in section 23-61 and 23-63 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the utilities director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs section 23-64 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
