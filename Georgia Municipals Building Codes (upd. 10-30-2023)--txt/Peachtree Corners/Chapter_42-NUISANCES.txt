Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted towards the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city.
(i)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(j)
The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(k)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

Sec. 42-43. - Chronic noise.
(a)
The purpose of this section is to establish a collaborative process for the city and the owner of any property identified as a source of chronic noise (i.e. "chronic noise producer") prohibited by this chapter and to develop and implement a noise mitigation plan intended to eliminate or reduce the noise to acceptable levels.
(b)
The city manager or designee shall make "chronic noise producer" designations as described in subsection (a) above. In making such a designation, the city manager shall take into consideration the following factors:
(1)
The number and frequency of noise complaints;
(2)
The proximity and physical relationship between the property and complaining locations;
(3)
The severity of sound events, both observed or measured;
(4)
The times and days of the week of sound events; and
(5)
The property owner's history of cooperation and efforts to alleviate the problem.
(c)
Prima facie evidence of a "chronic noise producer" is established when the city manager or designee notifies the property owner in writing of three or more unrelated incidents occurring at the property within a 12-month period which resulted in citations or summons returnable to a court with jurisdiction.
(d)
Upon designation, the city manager or designee shall inform the property owner in writing that the property is designated a chronic noise producer and the city manager or designee shall request an initial meeting with the property owner to review the information that formed the basis of the designation and hear any evidence or information concerning the complained of noise provided by the property owner. Following the initial meeting, the city manager or designee shall determine whether a noise mitigation plan is warranted in order to protect public health, safety and welfare. If the city manager or designee determines that a noise mitigation plan is not warranted, no further action shall be taken under this section.
(e)
If the city manager or designee determines that a noise mitigation plan is warranted, the city manager or designee shall develop a written noise mitigation plan for the property owner's review and execution. The plan may include, among other things:
(1)
Specific steps to eliminate or otherwise bring the noise producing activity into compliance with this chapter;
(2)
Restrictions on days of week or hours of noise producing activity;
(3)
Self-monitoring and reporting requirements;
(4)
A schedule for implementation; and
(5)
A schedule for review for possible revision or termination of the plan.
(f)
In the event that the owner of a property designated as a chronic noise producer:
(1)
Fails or refuses to participate in good faith in the development of a noise mitigation plan;
(2)
Refuses to agree to a noise mitigation plan; or
(3)
Fails to implement or comply with an agreed to noise mitigation plan, the city manager or designee may designate the property owner as non-cooperative and shall notify the mayor and city council of that determination.
Should a property owner designated as non-cooperative cure the basis for the designation, the city manager shall remove the designation and notify the property owner and the mayor and city council of that determination.
(g)
In the event that further noise enforcement action is taken against a property designated as a chronic noise producer, evidence regarding the property owner's participation in the development and implementation of and compliance with the noise mitigation plan shall be relevant to any prosecution or administrative or judicial review or appeal of the enforcement action. Specifically, such participation and compliance shall be a mitigating factor and may, but is not required to be, a justification for dismissing the enforcement action. A property owner designated as non-cooperative shall not be entitled to the benefits of this subsection unless the designation has been removed.
(h)
Appeals. A property owner may appeal a chronic noise producer or non-cooperative designation issued by the city manager provided said appeal is made in writing and within ten days after receiving written notice of such designation. Appeals shall be heard by the mayor and city council at a regularly scheduled meeting and within 90 days of receipt of the written appeal. The appellant shall have the right to present evidence at said hearing. A ruling on appeal is subject to review in the superior court of the county by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of certiorari for review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after notice of the decision has been sent to the appellant.
