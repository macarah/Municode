Sec. 34-284. - Subdivision review procedures.
(a)
Pre-application conference. Whenever any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, whether for residential or nonresidential development, the subdivider is encouraged to present to the department preliminary documents and graphic exhibits to permit early evaluation of the subdivider's intentions and coordination with the comprehensive plan, zoning resolution, Metropolitan River Protection Act, etc., and to inform and provide the subdivider with the necessary regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed project.
(b)
Concept plan approval.
(1)
Application for concept plan approval shall be submitted to the department using an application form and in a number of copies to be determined by the director. The concept plan shall include the entire property proposed for development, but need not include the applicant's entire contiguous ownership.
(2)
In such case that the subdivider elects not to submit a concept plan, then the subdivider may proceed directly with the submittal of development plans if they show the entire property proposed for development. In so doing, however, the subdivider assumes the risk of premature design and engineering expenses in the event that the city requires subsequent design and engineering changes.
(3)
Following concept plan approval, a clearing and grubbing permit may be issued based on a tree protection plan (if required, see tree protection ordinance) and soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approved by the department, and consistent with an approved certificate issued under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, if applicable.
(4)
Copies of the approved concept plan shall be provided to the department for permanent record, in a number as determined by the director.
(c)
Development plans approval for subdivisions.
(1)
An application for development plan approval and issuance of a development permit shall be submitted to the department using an application form and in a number of copies as determined by the director. The development plans may encompass a portion of a property included within an approved concept plan. However, if no concept plan has been approved, the development plans must include the entire property being developed and having the same zoning. The application shall include the preliminary plat, and construction drawings. All construction drawings and other engineering data shall be prepared and sealed by an authorized registered professional currently registered in the state, in accordance with provisions of state law.
(2)
Following submission to the department of a preliminary plat and all drawings required for development permit review, a grading permit shall be issued at the developer's request based on a tree protection plan (if required), soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, hydrology study, and related construction drawings, and consistent with an approved certificate issued under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, if applicable. The grading permit shall be limited to the area included within the development plans and may be further conditioned as deemed appropriate or necessary pending development permit approval.
(3)
The director shall indicate on a review copy of the drawings or in a written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the development plans with these regulations, principles of good design, the zoning resolution, conditions of zoning approval, and the regulations of other city departments and state agencies, as appropriate. The director shall have final staff authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments under these development regulations, the zoning resolution or conditions of zoning approval.
(4)
The director may not approve any preliminary plat whereon is shown a lot which would present particularly unusual difficulties for construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" because of its unusability, whether due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, lack of public utilities or for any other reason. A house location plan (HLP) may be required to be filed as a part of the preliminary plat approval to substantiate the buildability of any such difficult or unusual lot.
(5)
The subdivider shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the noted and written comments of the director.
(6)
Should an applicant disagree with the findings or final review comments of the director or of any other city department, concluding that factual or interpretive errors have been made, the following appeal procedure shall be followed to resolve the issues:
a.
Submit to the department of planning and development a written statement clearly defining the nature of the disagreement, the specific reference to the sections of the regulations (i.e., sewer regulations, development regulations, etc.) at issue, and the applicant's own opinion.
b.
Should the department under appeal fail to respond within ten working days from the date of transmittal of the appeal by the department of planning and development, the department shall automatically forward a copy of the appeal to the mayor and council for final action in their normal course of business.
(7)
When the director has determined that the plat and other development plans are in compliance with all applicable city regulations and zoning requirements and approval has been received from all affected city departments, he shall sign and date a certificate of development plans approval stamped or printed on a reproducible copy of the plat. Approved copies of the approved plat and development plans shall be printed on a reproducible copy of the plat. Approved copies of the approved plat and development plans shall be transmitted to the applicant and retained by the department for its records.
(8)
Following the above approval by all affected city departments, a development permit shall be issued at the developer's request to begin construction activities based on the approved development plans.
(d)
Final plat approval.
(1)
When the provisions of these regulations have been complied with, the subdivider may submit to the department an application for final plat approval, using an application form and in a number of copies as determined by the director.
(2)
The director shall indicate on a review copy of the plat or in a written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the final plat with these regulations, the zoning resolution, conditions of zoning approval, and the regulations of other city departments and state agencies, as appropriate. The director shall have final staff authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments under these development regulations, the zoning resolution or conditions of zoning approval.
(3)
The director may not approve any final plat whereon is shown or by which is otherwise created a lot which would present particularly severe and unusual difficulties for construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, lack of health department approval, or for any other justified reason.
(4)
Lots which would appear to be buildable under certain circumstances and would require further study or additional information before a building permit could be issued, but which present problems or unusual difficulties which can reasonably be addressed or overcome by the lot owner, may be included in the plat with the appropriate notation of the steps necessary to allow issuance of a building permit (see section 34-81).
(5)
The subdivider shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the comments of the director.
(6)
Final approval by the director shall not be shown on the final plat until all requirements of these and other applicable regulations have been met, and the director has received a completed request for approval of development conformance and an executed development performance and maintenance agreement. The agreement shall be accompanied by a bond, letter of credit, or other acceptable surety providing for the maintenance of all site landscape, right of way, and stormwater management facility improvements required by these regulations in the subdivision for a period 18 months following the date of approval of development conformance for subdivision. The maintenance bond period of application may be extended by the director at the request of the developer, provided it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the public.
(7)
The director shall further determine that either:
a.
All improvements and installation to the subdivision required for approval of the final plat under the rules and regulations of the city have been completed in accordance with the appropriate specifications; or

1.
Be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the subdivider or developer of all work required to complete all improvements and installations for the subdivision, or approved portion thereof, in compliance with these rules and regulations within a specified time, not to exceed three months;
2.
Be payable to, and for the indemnification of, the city;
3.
Be in an amount equal to the cost of construction of the required improvements not yet completed, plus an additional ten percent of said costs, as calculated by the director on the basis of yearly contract prices or city contracts, where available;

Payment of the cost of striping major thoroughfares or required signalization, if required, and not completed by the developer shall also be received by the engineering department prior to approval of the final plat.
(9)
Payment of the required plat recording fee shall be made to the department prior to approval of the final plat.
(10)
Once the department has approved the final plat and all other affected departments and agencies of government as required have certified compliance and signed the route sheet, the director shall certify by his signature on the original of the plat that all of the requirements of these regulations, the zoning resolution, and the conditions of zoning approval have been met, and that all other affected departments have approved the plat. The final plat shall not be deemed approved until it has been signed by the director and, where use of septic tanks is proposed, by a duly authorized representative of the health department.
(11)
Once the final plat has been so certified, the director shall authorize it to be recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the city. The subdivider shall provide the department with an appropriate number of copies of the recorded plat, as determined by the director. Deeds to lands dedicated to the city in fee simple, or to property owner's associations for park or recreational use, shall be recorded simultaneously with the final plat.
(12)
Periodically, but no less often than once each month, the director shall submit a listing of all approved final plats to the mayor and council for ratification of acceptance of all dedications.
