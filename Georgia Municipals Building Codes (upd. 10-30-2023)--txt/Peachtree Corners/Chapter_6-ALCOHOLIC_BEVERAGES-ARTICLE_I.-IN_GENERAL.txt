No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or serve in any managerial position by an establishment holding a license under this chapter until such person has been fingerprinted or cleared by the county chief of police or his designee, indicating that the person is eligible for such employment.
(2)
This section shall not be construed to include volunteer groups with nonprofit tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service whose volunteer efforts financially benefit a nonprofit organization with no direct financial benefit, either by wages, tips or donations, to the individual volunteer. No volunteer under the age of 18 shall be allowed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders or mix alcoholic beverages. Employees of a licensed establishment whose duties are limited solely to those of busboys, cooks, or dishwashers shall also be excluded from this section.
(3)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city or its designee and upon paying a fee which shall be established by the city, and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order.
(4)
The city shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. If there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the city shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the county chief of police or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal.
(5)
No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears, to the satisfaction of the city, that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city or county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which defendant who was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(6)
An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the police department or the city or its designee.
(7)
No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from the date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted.
(8)
All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the county chief of police or his designee, or the city manager or his designee.
(9)
Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(10)
All permits issued under this chapter remain the property of the city and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the police department or agent or employee of the city or its designee.
(11)
No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city or its designee may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue. Licensees are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in their possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit.
(12)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the county chief of police or his designee and the city, the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the month of June and again during the month of December.
(13)

Sec. 6-30. - Open area and patio sales.
(a)
Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on-premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the city or its designee.
(b)
Except within a designated entertainment district, the requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge.
(c)
The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the county's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes.
(d)
The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
(e)
If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the city or its designee. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the county's development and fire codes.
(f)
Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. Patio areas, as that term is used in this subsection, do not have to conform to the standards in this section.
(g)
Alcoholic beverages purchased within a designated entertainment district may be consumed throughout that entertainment district and transported anywhere within that district pursuant to article XII of this chapter.

(a)
It is prohibited for customers to leave the premises with open alcoholic beverages, and it is the licensee's responsibility to ensure that no open beverages are sold and carried out. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of wine or malt beverages for consumption at a publicly owned or privately- owned golf course or within a designated entertainment district.
(b)
It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.
(c)
It is prohibited for the manager or any employee to allow persons to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.
(d)
Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of law, any restaurant which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises may permit a patron to remove one unsealed bottle of wine per patron for consumption off premises, if the patron has purchased a meal and consumed a portion of the bottle of wine which has been purchased on the premises with such meal on the restaurant's premises. A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises must be securely resealed by the licensee or its employees before removal from the premises. The partially consumed bottle of wine shall be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a dated receipt for the bottle of wine and meal shall be provided by the licensee and attached to the container. If transported in a motor vehicle, the container with the resealed bottle of wine shall be placed in a locked glove compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the last upright seat of a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a trunk.
(e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, outside consumption of alcoholic beverages beyond a restaurant or patio area is permitted within a designated entertainment district pursuant to article XII of this chapter.

Sec. 6-32. - Specifications of premises.
No alcoholic beverage license shall be issued to any person unless the building in which the business will be located is complete and detailed plans of the building and outside premises are attached to the application, or unless proposed plans and specifications and a building permit of a proposed building to be built are attached to the application. The completed building or the proposed building shall comply with ordinances of the city, ordinances of the county, regulations of the state revenue commissioner and the state. The proposed building shall also be subject to final inspection and approval when completed by the building inspector. Each building in which the business will be located shall contain sufficient lighting so that the building itself and the premises on all sides of the building are readily visible at all times from the front of the street on which the building is located so as to reveal all of the outside premises of such building. Each applicant for an alcoholic beverage license shall attach to the application evidence of ownership of the building or proposed building, or a copy of the lease if the applicant is leasing the building. If the applicant is a franchisee, then such applicant shall attach a copy of the franchise agreement or contract with the application. All premises for which an alcoholic beverage license shall be issued shall afford therein adequate sanitary toilet facilities and shall be adequately illuminated so that all hallways, passageways and open areas may be clearly seen by the customers therein.

In no event, however, shall any such loud, unnecessary or unusual sound or noise be made by an establishment licensed under this chapter between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Loud sound or noise resulting from outdoor activities associated with a public stadium, coliseum or auditorium shall not be considered a violation of this section.
