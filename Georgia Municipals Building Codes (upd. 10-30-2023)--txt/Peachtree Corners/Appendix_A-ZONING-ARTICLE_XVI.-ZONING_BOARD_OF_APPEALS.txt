Sec. 1605. - Powers of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the following powers:
1.
To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Department of Planning and Development Director in the enforcement of this 2012 Zoning Resolution.
2.
To hear and decide requests for the Special Exceptions of the Zoning Resolution upon which the Zoning Board of Appeals is required to pass.
3.
To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variances from the terms of the Zoning Resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Zoning Resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that:
A.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and
B.
The application of the Resolution to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and
C.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
D.
Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner; and
E.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this Resolution.
No variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this Resolution or which would result in a greater intensity of development on a property than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved.
4.
In exercising the above powers, the Zoning Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this Resolution, reverse decisions or determinations from which the appeal is taken and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the Director of Planning and Development from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or revoke or direct the issuance or revocation of a Building or other permit.

Such variances may be granted in cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the City Council that:
A.
There are extraordinary or exceptional conditions pertaining to the group in question, and relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this Resolution; and
B.
The group consists of between four (4) and eight (8) persons who live together as a single housekeeping unit and who would otherwise find it economically prohibitive to live in a group of three (3) or fewer persons in a single family residential district; and
C.
The residential dwelling which forms the subject of the variance request contains at least eighty (80) square feet of bedroom space per occupant; and
D.
The residential dwelling which forms the subject of the variance request is served by public water and sewer service or public water and a septic system approved by the Gwinnett County Environmental Health Department for the proposed number of occupants; and

The Director of Planning and Development shall forthwith transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

Sec. 1607. - Required Public Hearings By the Zoning Board of Appeals.

Septic tanks and/or septic tank drain fields required under Section 18-50(a)(2) of the City of Peachtree Code of Ordinances may be placed within the stream buffer, subject to the City Manager or his/her designee's approval, if the applicant has demonstrated that no other feasible location exists on the property.

3.
Approval for the elimination of the striping has been obtained by the applicant in writing from the Gwinnett County Traffic Engineering Division of the Engineering Department and the Fire Services Division of the Gwinnett County Public Safety Department.
g.

2.
The accessory structures are limited to a swimming pool, garage/carport, barn, storage building, or other similar structures.
3.
The accessory structure is setback a minimum of 100 feet from the right-of-way and located no closer than 40 feet to any side property line. (If the accessory use if for animal quarters, this must be a minimum of 100 feet from any property line.)
4.
The accessory structure shall be screened with walls, fences, or suitable landscaping so that it is not visible from the street.
h.
Reduction in unit width for villas in R-TH Zoning District, not to exceed 10 feet.

4.
The reduction of the minimum area required for the keeping of livestock as specified within the R-100 Single Family Residence District up to maximum of ten (10) percent of the minimum area required.
5.
Reduction of the minimum distance to any property line for animal quarters for wild animals up to a maximum of 50 feet.
i.
Variance to allow for parking of a recreational vehicle in a location other than the rear yard may be permitted where such topographic and physical features render the rear yard location infeasible, but such approval shall be limited to the current property owner and shall expire upon sale of the property.
j.
Variances to the location, height and size of an otherwise permitted ground sign may be permitted where the topographic difference between the sign location and the adjacent public right-of-way creates a hardship. Variance to the size of an otherwise permitted wall sign may be permitted where excessive distance between the building and the public right-of-way creates a hardship.
