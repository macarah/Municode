Drainage easements for improved ditches, pipe construction, and detention facilities shall be cleared, opened, and stabilized at the time of development to control surface water runoff (See also article VII of this chapter). Runoff slope and sideslopes shall be specified by the developer's engineer, according to good engineering practice. Drainage easements for storm drain pipes that carry water shall be provided according to the minimum requirements found in Table 7-A below, and shall conform to city standards. The minimum easement width shall be based on the pipe diameter (span), plus two feet, plus two times the pipe invert depth. This value shall be rounded up to the nearest five feet. For pipes exceeding 16 feet in depth, a pre-submittal conference shall be held with the city to determine what additional requirements may be required.
