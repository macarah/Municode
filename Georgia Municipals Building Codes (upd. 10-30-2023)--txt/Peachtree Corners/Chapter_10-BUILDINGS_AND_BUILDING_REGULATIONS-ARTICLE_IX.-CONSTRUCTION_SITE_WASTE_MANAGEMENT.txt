Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-05-47, § 1, adopted June 16, 2016, did not specify manner of inclusion, hence, codification as §§ 10-501—10-505 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 10-501. - Discarded building materials and construction waste disposal requirements.
(a)
Discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, paint washout, litter, sanitary waste, and other construction site wastes must be properly managed and disposed of to reduce the risk of pollution from materials such as surplus or refuse building materials or hazardous wastes.
(b)
Practices such as trash disposal, recycling, proper material handling, and spill prevention and clean up measures must be implemented to reduce the potential for storm water runoff to mobilize construction site wastes and contaminate surface or ground water.
(c)
The proper management and disposal of wastes should be practiced at all construction sites to reduce stormwater runoff.
(1)
Waste management practices must be used to properly locate refuse piles.
(2)
Cover materials that may be displaced by rainfall or stormwater runoff.
(3)
Prevent all spill and leaks of hazardous wastes.
(d)
Guidelines for the proper handling, storage, and disposal of construction site waste must be posted in storage and use areas on site.
(Ord. No. 2015-05-47, § 1, 6-16-2016)
Sec. 10-502. - Storage and disposal of construction site waste.
(a)
Designate a waste collection area onsite that does not receive a substantial amount of runoff from upland areas and does not drain directly to a water body.
(b)
Designate areas for concrete trucks and equipment to be washed down so that it will not flow into storm drains or become surface water runoff that would lead to the storm drains. Under no circumstances should concrete truck wash out be conducted in the road or directly into storm drains.
(c)
Designate areas for paint cans and equipment to wash down that will not flow into storm drains or become surface water runoff that would lead to the storm drains or ground water recharge areas. Under no circumstances should excess paint be washed out in the road or directly into storm drains.
(d)
Ensure that containers have lids so they can be covered before periods of rain. Keep containers in a covered area whenever possible.
(e)
Schedule waste collection to prevent containers from overfilling, which would prevent them from being able to be covered.
(f)
Clean up spills immediately. For hazardous materials, follow cleanup instructions on the package. Use an absorbent material such as sawdust or cat litter to contain the spill.
(1)
During the demolition phase of construction, provide extra containers and schedule more frequent pick-ups.
(2)
Collect, remove, and dispose of all construction site waste at authorized disposal areas.
(Ord. No. 2015-05-47, § 1, 6-16-2016)
Sec. 10-503. - Disposal of hazardous materials.
(a)
Steps must be taken to ensure the proper disposal of hazardous materials:
(1)
Local waste management authorities must be consulted about the requirements of disposing of hazardous materials.
(2)
A hazardous waste container must be emptied and cleaned before it is disposed of to prevent leaks.
(3)
The original product label must never be removed from the container as it contains important safety information. Follow manufacturer's recommended method of disposal, which should be printed on the label.
(4)
If excess products need to be disposed of, they must never be mixed during disposal unless specifically recommended by the manufacturer.
(5)
Consult state and local solid waste regulatory agencies and private firms to ensure the proper disposal of contaminated soils that have been exposed to and still contain hazardous substances.
(b)
The following practices must be used to reduce risks associated with pesticides or to reduce the amount of pesticides that come in contact with stormwater:
(1)
Follow all federal, state, and local regulations that apply to the use, handling, and disposal of pesticides.
(2)
Do not handle the materials any more than necessary.
(3)
Store pesticides in a dry, covered area.
(4)
Construction curbs or dikes to contain pesticides in case of spillage.
(5)
Follow the recommended application rates and methods.
(6)
Have equipment and absorbent materials available in areas where pesticides are stored and used in order to contain and clean up any spills that occur.
(c)
The following management practices must be followed to reduce the contamination risk associated with petroleum products:
(1)
Store petroleum products and fuel for vehicles in dry, covered areas with construction curbs or dikes to contain any spills.
(2)
Immediately contain and clean up any spills with absorbent materials.
(3)
Have equipment available in fuel storage areas and in vehicles to contain and clean up spills.
(Ord. No. 2015-05-47, § 1, 6-16-2016)
Sec. 10-504. - Maintenance requirements.
(a)
Containers or equipment that may malfunction and cause leaks or spills must be identified through regular inspection of storage and use areas.
(b)
Equipment and containers must be inspected regularly for leaks, corrosion, support or foundation failure, or any other signs of deterioration and should be tested for soundness. Any found to be defective must be repaired or replaced immediately.
(c)
If failures to the onsite BMPs occur, such as sediment build up in the road way, this must be shoveled by hand or with a road sweeper. Under no circumstances should this sediment be washed down into the storm drainage system or the creeks and streams.
(Ord. No. 2015-05-47, § 1, 6-16-2016)
Sec. 10-505. - Violations.
Violations will be handled according to the City of Peachtree Corners' ordinances as they relate to stormwater management, erosion control, and illicit discharge or illegal connections.
