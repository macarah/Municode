For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

There is hereby created a body public and politic to be known as the Rabun County Convention and Visitors Bureau Authority. The authority shall be deemed to be a political subdivision of the state and a public corporation and, by that name, may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, and bring and defend actions. The authority shall be a convention center and visitors bureau authority created by Act of the General Assembly, and is intended to be an agency and instrumentality of the city and county, and a governmental unit for purposes of Sections 103, 141, and 150 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended [ 26 USC 1 et seq.]. The authority shall not be a state institution, nor a department or agency of the state, but shall be a creation of the state, having a distinct corporate identity. For the purposes of promotion and development of tourism as provided in Code Section 48-13-51 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated [O.C.G.A. § 48-13-51], the Rabun County Convention and Visitors Bureau Authority established by this act shall serve as a permissible, but not the exclusive, entity for the transfer of hotel and motel tax funds by the taxing entities in Rabun County.

The exercise of the powers conferred upon the authority in this Act shall constitute an essential governmental function for a public purpose.

The authority shall have all of the exemptions and exclusions from taxes as are now granted to cities and counties for the operation of properties or facilities similar to the properties and facilities to be owned or operated, or both, by the authority.
(d)
The authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the state, and the officers, agents, and employees of the authority, when in performance of work of the authority, shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as officers, agents, and employees of the State of Georgia. The authority may be sued the same as private corporations on any contractual obligation of the authority. Any action to protect or to enforce any rights pursuant to the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against the authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Rabun County, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. The property of the authority shall not be subject to levy and sale under legal process. The records of the authority shall be public records which are subject to Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50 of the O.C.G.A [O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.].

Sec. 8. - Budget and finances.
(a)
A budget committee consisting of the directors appointed by the governing authority of the county and by the chamber of commerce shall prepare the initial budget for the authority. Such budget shall be approved by unanimous vote of the committee, after which it shall be submitted to the full board of directors for approval by majority vote. Such initial budget shall not become effective until it has been approved by the governing authorities of the county and each city. The same process shall govern the second budget year, after which the procedures provided in subsection (b) of this section shall apply; provided, however, that if the second year budget fails to receive the required approval of the budget committee, the board of directors, or a governing authority, the provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall take effect immediately.
(b)
On or before April 30 of each year, the authority shall receive its verified audit for the prior year. Prior to October 1 of each year, the chairperson of the board shall appoint one director of the authority to confer jointly with the administrators or mayor of each city that collects hotel motel taxes and with the county administrator and to act as liaison with regard to a proposed budget for the authority for the ensuing year. Such persons shall annually be known as the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee shall produce a proposed budget for approval by the board and submission, by October 1 of each year, to the mayors and councils of the cities that collect hotel motel taxes and to the county board of commissioners. If the Budget Committee does not unanimously present a proposed budget to the board for approval and submission, then the board shall submit a continuation budget not greater than the total approved budget for the current year. The continuation budget shall include any upward or downward adjustment necessary to meet all debt service requirements. If either the cities or county, or both, shall fail or refuse to approve the budget as submitted by the board by December 31, then the continuation budget, as set forth above, shall become automatically effective in order to ensure operational continuity of the authority. Commencing Fiscal Year 2005, the cities and county shall each be required to provide funding to the authority as provided in paragraph (5.3) of Code Section 48-13-51 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 48-13-51]. The continuation budget as set forth above shall remain in effect until the next budget cycle. In the event of a failure to reach budget agreement at that time or in subsequent years, then a percentage increase shall automatically apply to all line items of the budget equivalent to the percentage increase for the relevant time period as determined by the Blue Book CPI index for all consumer goods.
Sec. 9. - Bylaws.
The authority may, by affirmative vote of a majority of all directors, adopt bylaws to govern the authority, its employees, and operation and may, by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors, repeal, replace, or amend such bylaws.
Sec. 10. - Liability limited.
Neither the directors of the authority nor any person executing notes, leases, or other agreements or obligations on behalf of the authority shall be personally liable thereon by reason of such execution.
Sec. 11. - Neither cities nor county bound.
The authority shall have no power or authority to bind the cities or the county by any contract, agreement, financial obligation, indebtedness, or otherwise; and no contract, agreement, financial obligation, or indebtedness incurred by the authority shall ever be a claim or charge against the cities or county; provided, however, that both the authority and the cities or county shall be bound to each other by contracts, agreements, financial obligations, or indebtedness between themselves.
Sec. 12. - Oversight.
Either the mayor and council of any of the cities or the county board of commissioners, or the designees of either, shall be authorized to inspect at their pleasure the state and condition of the authority, its properties, and all books and records pertaining to the authority and its affairs, and the authority shall give them such books and records and furnish them with assistance in making such inspections.
Sec. 13. - Dissolution.
Should the authority, for any reason, be dissolved after full payment of all indebtedness previously incurred, both as to principal and interest, title to all property of any kind and nature, real and personal, held by the authority at the time of such dissolution shall be conveyed to the cities and to the county as tenants in common as may be appropriate; or title to any such property may be conveyed prior to such dissolution in accordance with provisions which may be made therefor in any resolution or trust instrument relating to such property, subject to any liens, leases, or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to such property at the time of such conveyance.
