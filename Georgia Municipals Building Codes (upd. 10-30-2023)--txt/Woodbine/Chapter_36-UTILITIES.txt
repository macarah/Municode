The public works director shall utilize the then current environmental protection and acceptable building standards, normal to the trade, in arriving at his determination of satisfaction. He shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the public works director when the work is ready for final inspection, and before any underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within 72 hours of the receipt of notice by the public works director.
(d)
Private sewage disposal system. The type, capacities, location, and layout of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot is less than 15,000 square feet. No septic tank or cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
(e)
Subsequent available public sewer. At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in section 36-73, and should a direct connection be made to the public sewer in compliance with this article, any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge, and filled with clean bank run gravel or dirt and abandoned as a sewage treatment or disposal system.
(f)
Sanitary operation of private systems. The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary manner, as determined by the state, city and county health officers at all times, at no expense to the city.
(g)
State and county officers. No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the state and county health officers.
(Code 1985, § 7-103)
Sec. 36-75. - Building sewers and connections.
(a)
Permit required. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the public works director.
(b)
Classes of building permits. There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: for residential and commercial service, and for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the public works director. A permit and inspection fee of $50.00 for a residential or commercial building sewer permit and negotiated fee based upon use for an industrial user producing industrial wastes shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. The city council may waive the $50.00 per unit fee for residential or commercial developer with the development of five or more units provided that the developer is installing all lines, taps, and connections at his expense. The inspection fee would then be the hourly rate of the public works director as established in the schedule of fees multiplied by the actual hours used during the inspection. In addition to the permit and inspection fee, the owner shall also pay to the city a $30.00 security deposit, which is refundable upon discontinuance of service. No refundable deposits shall be returned to anyone, unless all indebtedness owing to the city under this division shall be paid in full.
(c)
Building costs. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(d)
One sewer per building. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
(e)
Existing sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the public works director to meet all requirements of this division.
(f)
Sewer construction and materials. The building sewer shall be cast iron pipe; ASTM 1251 Class 50 Ductile Iron, ASTM or PVC Specifications SDR 35 conforming to ASTM 3034. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe. Cast iron pipe may be required by the public works director where the building sewer is exposed to possible damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that non-metallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the public works director. All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
(g)
Size and slope of sewer. The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the public works director, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe when installed in a horizontal position shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot nor more than one quarter inch per foot.
(h)
Elevation of sewer. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged into the building sewer.
(i)
Bearing walls and alignment. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings.
(j)
Open trench work. All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the public works director. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12; except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected.
(k)
Surface runoff and groundwater. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(l)
Connection rules and regulations. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city, or in amplifications of the ASTM and the WPCP Manual of Practice Number Nine. All such connections shall be made gastight and materials must be approved by the public works director before installation.
(m)
Connection at "Y" branch. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, which entry in the downstream direction can be of any angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the public works director.
(n)
Notice for inspection and connection. The applicant of the building sewer permit shall notify the public works director when the building owner is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the public works director or his representative.
(o)
Excavation; barricades and notice. All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Prior to excavation, blockage, disruption, or any disturbance of any public street, road, highway, byway, sidewalk or other public right-of-way, notification must be made to and approval obtained from the public works director at least 72 hours in advance of such excavation, blockage, disruption or disturbance. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(p)
Industrial waste. Any industry or establishment introducing industrial waste to the system shall agree to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's pretreatment regulations.
(Code 1985, § 7-104)
Sec. 36-76. - Use of the public sewers.
(a)
Stormwater, runoff, cooling water, etc. No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
(b)
Unpolluted discharges. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the public works director. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the public works director, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.
(c)
Prohibited discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:

2.
Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye, wastes and vegetable tanning solutions).
3.
Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements, in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works.
4.
Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined herein.
j.
Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
k.
Water or wastes having a five-day biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 parts per million by weight on a 24-hour composite basis, or for any sample period having a five-day BOD in excess of two times the average influent value for the affected sewage treatment plant during the previous calendar year.
l.
Water or wastes having a suspended solids content in excess of 350 parts per million by weight on a 24-hour composite basis or having a suspended solids content for any sample period greater than two times the average influent value for the affected sewage treatment plant during the previous calendar year.
(d)
Evaluation of substances. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess, the characteristics enumerated in section 36-75, and which, in the judgment of the public works director, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the public works director may:
(1)
Reject the wastes;
(2)
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
(3)
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4)
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provision of this division.
If the public works director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the public works director, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
(e)
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the public works director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be returned for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the public works director, and shall be located so as to be readily handle liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the public works director, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(f)
Preliminary treatment and flow equalizing systems. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(g)
Manhole for industries. When required by the public works director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the public works director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(h)
Examination of water. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, and shall be determined at the control manholes provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards, to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples).
(i)
Industrial agreement with city. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.
