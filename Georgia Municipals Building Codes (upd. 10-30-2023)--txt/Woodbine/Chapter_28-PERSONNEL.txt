c.
A copy of the decision of the city council shall be given to the affected employee and the department head of same, or to the applicant, within three working days following the completion of the hearing.

The failure of supervisory employees to follow the steps outlined above shall result in conferring upon the employee the right automatically to proceed to the next step in the grievance procedure. The failure of the employee to follow the steps outlined above may result in the dismissal of the grievance at any step.
(6)
In those cases where dismissal of an employee is involved, the city administrator shall immediately notify the affected employee that, if requested, a hearing before the city council will be set up and held within 15 working days of the action taken.

It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that no department head, the mayor or member of the city council, or city administrator shall appoint or employ any person to any regular classified position in the city who is a member of the immediate or extended family of such officer if such appointment or employment would cause a relative of such officer to come under the direct supervision of such officer.

(Code 1985, ยง 3-919)
Sec. 28-20. - Substance abuse policy.
The city is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any city employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, comes to work under the influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the city has established the following policy:
(1)
Violations.
a.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.
b.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or while possessing in his body, blood, or urine illegal drugs in any detectable amount.
c.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol.
d.
It is a violation of the city policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications.
e.
Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(2)
Employee assistance.
a.
The city offers resource information on various means of employee assistance in our community, including, but not limited to, drug and alcohol abuse programs. Employees are encouraged to use this resource file, which is located in the city hall personnel office.
b.
Information will be distributed to employees for their confidential use, upon request.
(3)
General procedures.
a.
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status.
b.
The supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred.
c.
If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, one of the following actions will be taken:
1.
The employee will be sent home.
2.
The employee, if unable to care for himself, will be sent to a medical facility.
Depending on the determination of the observed impairment, the employee may be accompanied by a supervisor, if necessary. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive.
(4)
Opportunity to contest or explain results.
a.
Employees and job applicants who have a positive confirmed test may explain or contest the result to the city within five working days after the city contacts the employee or job applicant and shows him the positive test result as it was received from the laboratory in writing.
b.
Any disciplinary action taken as a result of the test results will proceed once the test results are received and are not dependent upon the employee's right to explain or contest the results.
(5)
Confidentiality. The confidentiality of any information received by the city through a substance abuse testing program shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law. All information received through substance abuse testing is confidential, but may be disclosed in a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding in accordance with state law.
(6)
Pre-employment drug testing.
a.
Applicants to the city for positions that are sensitive from a safety, health or security standpoint will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment.
b.
Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the city, and by signing a consent agreement will release the city, its officers and agents from liability. An applicant who refuses to submit to substance abuse testing will not be eligible for hire.
c.
If the physician, official, or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the job-applicant has tampered with the specimen, the applicant will not be considered for employment.
d.
The city will not discriminate against applicants for employment because of a past history of drug abuse. It is the current abuse of drugs, preventing employees from performing their job properly, that the city will not tolerate. Individuals who have failed a pre-employment test may initiate another inquiry with the city after a period of not shorter than six months; but they must present themselves drug-free as demonstrated by urinalysis or other test selected by the city.
(7)
Employee testing.
a.
The city has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job or who abuse alcohol on the job. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees to submit to substance abuse testing under the following circumstances:
1.
When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Reasonable suspicion is based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the employer's policy drawn from those facts in light of experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon, but not limited to, the following:
(i)
Observable phenomena while at work such as direct observation of substance abuse or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired due to substance abuse.
(ii)
Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance.
(iii)
A report or suspicion of substance abuse provided by a reliable and credible source.
(iv)
Information that any employee has caused or contributed to an accident while at work.
(v)
Evidence that any employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited, or transferred drugs while working or while on the city's premises or while operating the city's vehicle, machinery, or equipment.
2.
When employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job inquiry that resulted in a loss of worktime, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. A supervisor may send employees for a substance abuse test if they are involved in on-the-job accidents where personal injury or damage to city or private property occurs.
3.
As part of a follow-up program of treatment for drug abuse.
4.
When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely-scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the city's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification group.
5.
Upon request as part of a random drug screening program.
b.
Employees with a confirmed positive test result may, at their option and expense, have a second confirmation test made on the same specimen. An employee will not be allowed to submit another specimen for testing.
c.
If the physician, official, or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has tampered with the specimen, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
d.
An employee who refuses to submit to substance abuse testing will be subject to disciplinary action.
(8)
Alcohol abuse.
a.
The consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages on the city's premises is prohibited.
b.
An employee whose normal faculties are impaired due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or whose blood alcohol level tests positive, while on duty or on city business shall be guilty of misconduct, and shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
c.
Failure to submit to a required substance abuse test is misconduct and shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
(9)
Responsibility of city supervisors. It is the responsibility of the city's supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug problem to seek help.
(10)
Goals and intent of policy. The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive, and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment with the city.
