5.04.04.1 - Signs in the Lake Carroll Village Overlay
Signage is vital in the area encompassed by the Lake Carroll Village Overlay. While functioning primarily as a communication tool, signs can also contribute to the unique character of an area. The area encompassed by the Lake Carroll Village Overlay has a diverse mix of pole, monument, wall, temporary, and dilapidated signage. The intent of the sign design standards in the Lake Carroll Village Overlay is: (i) to encourage excellence in signage, both as a communication tool and as an art form; (ii) to allow and encourage creative and unique sign designs while preventing cluttered and unattractive streetscapes; and (iii) to provide basic parameters for creative signs that may be varied and unique like the businesses they represent.
Effectively designed signage should respond to the site, landscape, and architectural design context within which they are located. Signs should be compatible in scale, proportion, and design with the building's facade and its surroundings. These standards do not dictate design.
The sign standards for the Lake Carroll Village Overlay address the following: (i) appropriate locations; (ii) number of signs allowed on a property; (iii) maximum area for individual signs; (iv) height limitation; (v) color and materials; (vi) lighting; (vii) temporary signage (both on-site and off-site); (viii) off-site signs; and (ix) dilapidated or abandoned signage.
A.
Non-Permitted Signs.

4.
Abandoned or discontinued signs or structures.
5.
Electronic reader boards. For purposes of this section, the term "electronic reader board" is not intended to preclude all signs with digital lettering or numbering, which can be changed from a remote location. Rather, the term "electronic reader board" is meant to refer to a sign whose text, numbering, messaging, or graphics are either in constant motion or change every few seconds or minutes, often with a corresponding change of color or light intensity.

5.04.04.2 - Signs in the Maple Street Overlay
Signage is vital in the area encompassed by the Maple Street Overlay. While functioning primarily as a communication tool, signs can also contribute to the unique character of an area. The area encompassed by the Maple Street Overlay has a diverse mix of pole, monument, wall, temporary, and dilapidated signage. The intent of the sign design standards in the Maple Street Overlay is: (i) to encourage excellence in signage, both as a communication tool and as an art form; (ii) to allow and encourage creative and unique sign designs while preventing cluttered and unattractive streetscapes; and (iii) to provide basic parameters for creative signs that may be varied and unique like the businesses they represent.
Effectively designed signage should respond to the site, landscape, and architectural design context within which they are located. Signs should be compatible in scale, proportion, and design with the building's faรงade and its surroundings. These standards do not dictate design.
The sign standards for the Maple Street Overlay address the following: (i) appropriate locations; (ii) number of signs allowed on a property; (iii) maximum area for individual signs; (iv) height limitation; (v) color and materials; (vi) lighting; (vii) temporary signage (both on-site and off-site); (viii) off-site signs; and (ix) dilapidated or abandoned signage.

4.
Abandoned or discontinued signs or structures.
5.
Electronic reader boards. For purposes of this section, the term "electronic reader board" is not intended to preclude all signs with digital lettering or numbering, which can be changed from a remote location. Rather, the term "electronic reader board" is meant to refer to a sign whose text, numbering, messaging, or graphics are either in constant motion or change every few seconds or minutes, often with a corresponding change of color or light intensity.

Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffer and landscape areas free from litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the buffer or landscaping shall be replaced in the event it dies.
D.
Aesthetics, placement, materials, and color.
1.
Attached WCFs shall have both antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that are of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. In addition, the placement of the antenna array and supporting equipment shall be consistent with proper functioning of the WCF while mitigating the impact of the facility on the surrounding area.
2.
WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish, or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color (except in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts), so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. In most instances, WCFs with support structures should be of the monopole variety except when providers can document and demonstrate need for lattice-type towers.
E.
Separation requirement.
In zoning districts, other than general commercial and industrial districts, WCFs over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter (ยผ) of a mile from any existing WCF that is over ninety (90) feet in height.
F.
Lighting.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by FAA or other applicable authority. Lighting may be required if the tower is near a non-FAA controlled landing strip pending review by the City Manager. If lighting is required, the City may review the available lighting alternative and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
G.
Noise.
No equipment shall be operated at a WCF so as to produce noise in excess of the applicable noise standards under WAC 173-60, except for in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis. No generator shall be used prior to commercial power being delivered to the site.
H.
Security fencing.
WCFs with support structures shall be enclosed by a security fence not less than six (6) feet in height, and the support structure shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the City may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate; however, nothing herein shall prevent security fencing which is necessary to meet other requirements of state or federal agencies.
I.
Radio frequency emissions.
1.
The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA) gives the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) sole jurisdiction in the field of regulation of Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, and WCFs which meet the FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of the RF impacts.
2.
In order to provide information to its citizens, copies of ongoing FCC information concerning WCFs and radio frequency emission standards shall be made available. Applicants for WCFs shall be required to provide information on the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC standards.
J.
Federal requirements.
All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with authority over WCFs. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCFs governed by this ordinance shall bring such antenna arrays and/or support structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective dates of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring WCFs into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense in accordance with Section 5.05.07 of this UDO.
K.
Structural integrity.
To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled "Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures (or Equivalent)," as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City concludes a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the tower's owner, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove such tower at the owner's expense in accordance with Section 5.05.07 of this UDO. A letter stamped by an engineer certified in the state shall be required stating that the WCF and support structure meets or exceeds all applicable requirements set forth herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this section shall not be interpreted to permit aggregation of multiple height increases, such as by seeking to install a new utility pole or wireless support structure, and then attempting to exceed what would have been the maximum permissible height for that new or replacement pole by requesting an increase to attach facilities. Height limits for existing utility poles or wireless support structures shall be assessed based on the height of the structure before the first wireless facility is installed, and applicants shall not be permitted to request additional height increases based on the total height of a pole, including existing wireless facilities above the top of the utility pole or wireless support structure.
B.
Zoning. Any wireless provider that seeks to construct or modify a utility pole, wireless support structure or wireless facility that exceeds the height or size limits contained in this section, shall be subject to applicable zoning requirements.
C.
Undergrounding provisions. Applicant shall comply with the nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. ยง 36-66C-7(i).

5.06.08 - Development standards
In addition to the requirements detailed elsewhere in this section, the following development standards shall apply to all small wireless facilities governed by this section to the extent permissible by law, specifically including any facilities deployed in historic districts or affecting any pole defined as "decorative" under applicable state law:
A.
No small wireless facility shall be attached to a decorative pole, except as provided by O.C.G.A. ยง 36-66C-12.
B.
All small wireless facilities shall incorporate concealment elements to the maximum extent feasible and as appropriate to the site and type of facility, and to the extent permissible by law. Specifically, all small wireless facilities shall employ and maintain camouflage design techniques to minimize visual impacts and provide appropriate screening. Such techniques shall be employed so that the installation, operation, and appearance of the small wireless facilities will be consistent with the character of the surrounding area or the structure to which the small wireless facility is attached.
C.
Wireless providers shall adhere to the City's reasonable and nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements in accordance with O.C.G.A. ยง 36-66C-7(i).
D.
Wireless providers may not place new poles or replace a decorative pole unless it has complied with the certification requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. ยง 36-66C-6(k).
E.
Monopoles. Every new utility pole or wireless support structure shall be a monopole rather than a lattice tower or guy-wire support tower, unless otherwise authorized.
F.
Access. No facility shall be built so as to cause the right-of-way in which the facility is located to fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or otherwise obstruct access.
G.
Security. All facilities shall be designed so as to be resistant to and minimize the opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions, which would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight, or attractive nuisances.
H.
Screening. Any equipment that is not installed underground shall be screened by structures, topography, or vegetation to the maximum extent feasible. Coaxial cables, conduit lines, and electrical boxes for ground-mounted antennas shall be placed underground or within approved structures to the extent feasible.
I.
Public art, flagpoles, artificial natural features. Wireless providers shall be encouraged to design small wireless facilities to serve as public art, flagpoles, or artificial natural features such as trees or rocks where such designs are appropriate and feasible.
J.
Colors and Materials. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, small wireless facilities shall have a non-reflective finish and shall be a neutral color consistent with the predominant background color.
K.
Lighting. Signal lights or illumination shall be prohibited unless required by the FCC or the Federal Aviation Administration.
L.
Signage. The facilities shall not bear any signage, other than certification, warning, information, safety, and directional signage, or other non-commercial signage required by law, or expressly permitted by the City.
M.
Power supply. Any facility occupying a City-owned pole is only permissible to the extent the existing function of the pole is not impeded. In particular, street lights and traffic lights' power supplies may not be used by applicants. When attaching to City-owned poles, applicants are responsible for securing separately metered power for their facilities, and are responsible for any and all costs incurred in modifying a pole to support additional power supplies. In all other cases, applicants are responsible for ensuring that their power supply arrangements with electric utilities do not result in any incremental cost increase to the City.
