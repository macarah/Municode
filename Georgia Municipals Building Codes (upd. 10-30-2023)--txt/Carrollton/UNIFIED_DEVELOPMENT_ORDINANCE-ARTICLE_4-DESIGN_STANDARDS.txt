4.07.00 - LANDSCAPING, BUFFERS, AND TREE PROTECTION

4.07.01 - Purpose
The City deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees in the City without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their shade, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property, and their contribution to the general well being and quality of life of the citizens of Carrollton. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this title, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees. It is also the intent of this article that all applicable sites within the city maintain a minimum tree canopy, as defined and described herein.
4.07.02 - Applicability and Provision of Landscape Plans
A.
Applicability. New developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements and developments requiring preliminary plats, and developments for which a land development/Land-disturbance permit is required, shall be subject to the provisions of this article.
B.
Landscape plans. A plan showing required buffers, tree canopy, and landscaping shall be submitted in support of a site plan or building permit. All landscaping plans for buffers and related areas shall include the following information:
1.
The location, varieties, number and size of plantings to be planted within the development;
2.
Topographic information showing the final site grading and drainage for the landscape area;
3.
Impervious surfaces, including sidewalks, pavement areas and building footprints;
4.
Total tree canopy calculation by percent provided by both existing and proposed trees. See Appendix A, the City of Carrollton Tree Species table, to calculate tree canopy by percent;
[5.]
Buffer areas;
[6.]
Specimen Trees; and
7.
Property lines.
4.07.03 - Maintenance Requirements
The applicant, property owner and/or subsequent or successor owners and their agents shall be responsible for maintenance of any landscaping and any landscaped buffer on the property on a continuing basis for the life of the development.
A.
Maintenance. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include, but not be limited to, mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering, weeding and other activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds and other materials or plants not part of the landscaping. Failure to maintain landscape areas shall be considered a violation of this UDO.
B.
Plant material. All required plant material shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition as is appropriate for the season. Plant materials that exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease and/or damage shall be appropriately treated, and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting season.
C.
Pruning. All tree pruning on public property shall conform to the ANSI A300 standards or other best management practices for tree care.
D.
Tree topping. It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to top or severely prune any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Severe pruning seriously affects the tree's food supply, can scald the newly exposed bark, make trees vulnerable to insect invasion, stimulate the regrowth of dense, upright branches below the pruning cut, make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage, disfigure the tree aesthetically, and sometimes result in the death of the tree. Where appropriate, crown reduction by a qualified arborist may be substituted. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under obstructions such as utility wires where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this provision.
E.
Maintenance bond required. For new developments, a two-year maintenance bond shall, unless waived by the City Manager, be required for all maintained landscaping.
4.07.04 - Tree Canopy Requirements
It is the goal of the City of Carrollton to achieve and maintain tree canopy cover and to promote the functional distribution of that canopy throughout and within the established zoning districts as development occurs through goals and requirements for tree canopy cover.
A.
Minimum total tree canopy requirements. New developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements and developments requiring preliminary plats, and developments for which a land development/Land-disturbance permit is required, shall provide at least a minimum amount of tree canopy cover as shown in Table 4.07.04(C). Existing single family residential lots that appear on a preliminary plat approved prior to the adoption of this UDO are exempt.
B.
Minimum conserved tree canopy cover requirement. On lots equal or greater than 12,500 square feet in gross acreage a minimum amount of tree canopy cover shall originate from tree conservation as shown in Table 4.07.04(C). Trees within forested areas, open space, buffers, stormwater retention and detention areas and facilities, parks and open areas, passive recreation areas, 100-year floodplain, jurisdictional wetlands, and other similar forested areas shall count toward the minimum conserved tree canopy cover requirement if they meet the definition of a conservable tree or trees. All tree conservation shall be accomplished with the tree protection standards set forth in Section 4.07.07.
C.
Tree canopy cover required by zoning district. The amount of tree canopy cover required as measured in percent of total gross acreage of the site or lot varies by zoning district. Canopy calculations by species is specified in Appendix A in the City of Carrollton Tree Species table. Table 4.07.04(C) contains the minimum tree canopy cover required according to the zoning district. On new single family residential subdivisions, tree canopy cover is required for the overall site, as well as for each individual lot. Tree canopy cover required for each lot may be counted toward the tree canopy cover required for the entire site. The tree canopy cover located in the adjacent public right-of-way may be applied to the individual lot and overall tree canopy requirements.
