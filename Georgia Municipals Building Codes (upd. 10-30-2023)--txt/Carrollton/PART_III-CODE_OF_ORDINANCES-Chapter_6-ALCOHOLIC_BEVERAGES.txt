ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 6-1. - Findings and public purpose.
modified
(a)
Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of the citizens and public safety officials who have appeared before us, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create behavior identified with nudity, disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depreciation of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burdens on the judicial system. Therefore, the restriction of adult uses and adult entertainment in restaurants wherein alcohol is authorized to be consumed on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide adult entertainment or adult uses.
(b)
Pursuant to the vote of the citizens of the city authorizing the sale of distilled spirits by the drink for consumption on the premises in bona fide eating establishments and pursuant to the vote of the citizens of the city authorizing the sale of distilled spirits by the package and in accordance with a plan designed for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city:
(1)
To establish reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sale of alcoholic beverages;
(2)
To protect and preserve schools, churches, and similar places of public assembly; and
(3)
To preserve residential areas regarding, among other things, the character of the areas, their particular suitability for particular uses and the congestion in the surrounding roads and streets, with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions, and sustaining the stability of neighborhood and property values.
(c)
Consistent with the previous actions of the mayor and city council limiting malt beverage and wine sales by the drink for consumption on the premises ancillary to the primary business of serving food prepared on the premises, it is also the finding, intent and policy of the mayor and city council that the issuance of any alcoholic beverage license for consumption on the premises under this chapter shall be strictly limited to bona fide eating establishments which shall be either restaurants, supper clubs, private clubs, farm wineries, distilleries, or alcoholic beverage caterers or breweries as defined in this chapter and which meet all applicable requirements of the same.
(d)
It is also the finding, intent and policy of the mayor and city council that the issuance of any alcoholic beverage license for the sale of distilled spirits by the package shall be strictly limited to the terms and conditions of this chapter.
(e)
It is expressly not the intent of the mayor and city council to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises in nightclubs, bars, pubs, dancehalls, pool halls, gamerooms or any other establishment not qualifying as a bona fide eating establishment either as a restaurant, supper club, private club, farm winery, distillery, or alcoholic beverage caterer or brewery as defined in this chapter.
(f)
It is further the stated directive of the mayor and city council that the authority to issue, renew and administer licenses for consumption on the premises and for the sale of distilled spirits by the package granted to the city manager shall be discharged in accordance with this finding.
