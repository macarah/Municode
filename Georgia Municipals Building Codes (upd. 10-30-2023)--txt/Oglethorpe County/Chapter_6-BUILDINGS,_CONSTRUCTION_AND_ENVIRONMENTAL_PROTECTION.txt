DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 6-127. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the unincorporated areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Code 2008, § 37-102)
Sec. 6-128. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(2)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(3)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(4)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Code 2008, § 37-103)
Sec. 6-129. - Objectives.

(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after November 1, 2006, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after May 11, 1998, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads), is completed after May 11, 1998, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is:
(1)
Built on a single chassis;
(2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement.
(1)
The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
(2)
The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include:
a.
Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or
b.
Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

3.
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3) of this section.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-132 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with subsection 4a of this section with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.
(Code 2008, § 37-402)

(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the county planning and zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is minimized to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances. A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(1)
A finding of good and sufficient cause, which requires:
a.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
b.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The county planning and zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
