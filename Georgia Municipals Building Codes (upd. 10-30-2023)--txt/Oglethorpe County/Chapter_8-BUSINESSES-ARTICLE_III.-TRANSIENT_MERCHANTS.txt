ARTICLE III. - TRANSIENT MERCHANTS

Sec. 8-276. - Intent and purpose.
The intent and purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating commercial door-to-door sales and solicitation. This article is not a de facto prohibition of door-to-door sales or solicitation, nor is it an attempt to adversely affect interstate commerce. Instead, this article is intended to balance competing interests, reduce criminal activity, and protect the citizens of the county from abusive sales techniques versus the conduct of proper commercial sales activity. This article is intended to regulate door-to-door sales by permitting solicitors; establishing a "no solicitation" list; and promulgating reasonable time and manner restrictions. This article is not intended to allow any activity which would otherwise be unlawful. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or restrict a person from going door-to-door for the primary purpose of disseminating religious, political, civic, or ideological beliefs, or serving a charitable organization.
