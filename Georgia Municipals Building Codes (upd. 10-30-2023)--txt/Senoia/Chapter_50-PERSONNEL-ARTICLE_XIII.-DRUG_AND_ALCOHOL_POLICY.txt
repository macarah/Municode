ARTICLE XIII. - DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY

Sec. 50-261. - Intent.
The city is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any city employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, comes to work under the influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the city has established the following policy:
Any employee found to be using alcohol or illegal drugs during working hours will be terminated.
It is violation of city policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or while possessing in his/her body, blood or urine illegal drugs in any detectable amount.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. (However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of prescribed medications.)
Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment at city.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Sec. 50-262. - General procedures.
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next, the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse had occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent home or to a medical facility by taxi or other safe transportation alternative-depending on the determination of the observed impairment-and accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. A drug and alcohol test may be in order. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Sec. 50-263. - Prohibitions.
Alcohol prohibitions. This policy prohibits any alcohol misuse that could affect performance of an employee's ability to function, including:
(1)
Use while performing any job function for the city.
(2)
Use during the four hours before performing any job function for the city.
(3)
Reporting for work or remaining at work with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater. [4](See note below.)

(5)
Use during eight hours following an accident, or until he/she undergoes a post-accident test.
(6)
Refusal to take a required test.
Documentation of this test constitutes written warning that the city's policy has been violated and the next occurrence will result in termination of employment.
Drug prohibitions. This policy prohibits any drug use that could adversely affect employee performance including:
(1)
Unlawful use of any controlled substance.
(2)
Use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medication, use of which medication could be reasonably anticipated to impair the employee's ability to perform his/her job functions in a safe and competent manner.
(3)

All employees will inform appropriate supervision of any therapeutic drug, which may have adverse side effects, use prior to performing any job function for the city.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Note— An employee found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall not perform, nor be permitted to perform, any safety-sensitive function for at least 24 hours. Before any employee return to work, he/she must undergo a return to duty test with a result of less than 0.02.

Sec. 50-264. - Substance prohibited/prescription medications.
Alcohol use. Meaning the consumption of any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication containing alcohol which, when consumed, causes an alcohol concentration in excess of those prescribed above.
Controlled substances. The city will conduct urinalysis to detect the presence of the following substances:
• Marijuana
• Cocaine
• Opiates
• Amphetamines
• Phencyclidine (PCP)
Prescription medications. Employees taking legally prescribed medication which may adversely affect job performance issued by a licensed health care professional familiar with the employee's work-related responsibilities must report such use to their immediate supervisor, and may be required to present written evidence from the health care professional which describes the effects such medications may have on the employee's ability to perform his/her tasks.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Sec. 50-265. - Types of testing.
The following types of testing will be implemented at the city as part of our substance abuse policy.
Under all circumstances, when an employee is directed to provide either a breath or urine sample in accordance with these procedures, he/she must immediately comply as instructed. Refusal will constitute a positive result, and the employee will be immediately removed from their job function and subject to termination.
Pre-employment drug testing.
(1)
All job applicants for safety sensitive or fiduciary responsibilities at the city will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment.
(2)
Job applicant means a person who has applied for a position and has been offered employment conditioned upon successfully passing a substance abuse test and may have begun work pending the results of the test.
(3)
All temporary and part-time workers for the city are subject to pre-employment testing or will be obtained from temporary agencies that have a certified testing program already in place.
(4)
Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the city, and by signing a consent agreement will release the city from liability.
(5)
If the physician, official or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the job-applicant has tampered with the specimen, the applicant will not be considered for employment.
(6)
The city will not discriminate against applicants for employment because of a past history of drug abuse. It is the current abuse of drugs, preventing employees from performing their jobs properly, that the city will not tolerate.
Random testing. Each year the city will conduct random drug and alcohol tests equal to 50 percent of the total average number of employees at the city during the calendar year. All random tests will be unannounced and the dates and times will vary throughout the year.
All employees in safety sensitive or fiduciary jobs will have their names entered into a computer and a computerized random number generator software will be utilized to ensure that every employee has an equal chance of being selected each time names are chosen for testing.
Once notified, an employee must proceed immediately to the assigned collection site. Refusal to submit constitutes a positive result and will result in immediate termination. Once an employee is tested, their name is available for selection the next time names are chosen. This ensures that every employee is eligible to be tested each time random tests are conducted.
Reasonable suspicion testing. The city has adopted testing practices to identify employees in safety sensitive or fiduciary positions who use illegal drugs on or off the job or who abuse alcohol on the job. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees in safety sensitive or fiduciary positions to submit to substance abuse testing under the following circumstances.
When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Reasonable suspicion is based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the city policy drawn from specific objective and articulable facts and reasonable inference drawn from those facts in light of experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon, but not limited to, the following:
(1)
Observable phenomena while at work such as direct observation of substance abuse or the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired due to substance abuse.
(2)
Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance.
(3)
A report of substance abuse provided by a reliable and credible source.
(4)
Evidence that an individual has tampered with any substance abuse test during his/her employment with the current employer.
(5)
Information that an employee has caused or contributed to an accident while at work or was directly involved in an accident.
(6)
Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited, or transferred drugs while working or while on the employer's premises or while operating the employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment.
(7)
Other observable phenomena such as the odor of alcohol or drugs (i.e. marijuana) emanating from the body.
If a supervisor has reasonable suspicion that an employee may be impaired by substances, i.e. drugs or alcohol, the supervisor must promptly fill out a drug/substance incident check sheet documenting the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. The record must be completed within 24 hours of the observed behavior or before the result of the drug test is released, whichever is earlier. A copy of this documentation shall be given to the employee upon request and the original documentation shall be kept confidential and maintained in a file for a minimum of one year.
The supervisor should make a reasonable effort to have a second supervisor observe the employee if possible. The supervisor should discuss the situation with the employee to try and ascertain if an impairment exists. If the supervisor feels that grounds exist for a reasonable suspicion test, the supervisor should contact the personnel officer and request a drug and alcohol test.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Sec. 50-266. - Post-accident testing.
Post-accident testing is called for when an employee has caused or contributed to an on-the-job injury that results in a loss of work time, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. The city also may send employees for post-accident testing if they are involved in an on-the-job accident where personal injury or damage to city vehicles or equipment shall be subject to post-accident testing. The employee shall notify their supervisor immediately following any vehicle or equipment accident. Post-accident is defined as drug and alcohol testing.
Drivers shall submit to a drug and alcohol test as soon as possible after an accident, if the driver is found at fault in the accident. An accident is defined as an occurrence involving a motor vehicle operating on a public road which results in:
(1)
The death of a person, bodily injury to a person that requires immediate medical attention away from the scene of the accident, time lost from work, or to seek medical attention, disabling damage to one or more motor vehicles as a result of the accident, requiring the vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. The driver may not consume alcohol for eight hours following the accident, or until the alcohol test is administered, whichever is less and must submit to a drug test within 32 hours following an accident.
Any driver involved in an accident that requires a post-accident testing is responsible for ensuring that a specimen is collected and forwarded to a certified laboratory in a manner that conforms with 49 C.F.R. Part 40. The city shall provide drivers with the information necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
If a driver is seriously injured and cannot provide a specimen for testing, that driver shall authorize the release of hospital reports or other documents that would indicate whether there were controlled substances in the driver's system.
• The above section only applies to those employees in safety sensitive positions.
( Ord. of 12-2-2013 )
Sec. 50-267. - Return to duty-follow up testing.
Employees retained in employment who have tested positive for controlled substances shall not be allowed to return to work or to operate any company motor vehicle or equipment until they have completed a rehabilitation program prescribed by a substance abuse professional and test negative on a return-to-duty drug and alcohol test. Any employee returning to work after a positive test result shall continue in any after-care program required by the city and shall be subject to follow-up testing for a period no less than 24 months and not more than 60 months after returning to work. The tests are conducted as part of a follow-up program to treatment for drug or alcohol abuse. Advance notice of testing will not be given to the employee.
Any employee testing positive or controlled substances shall be given the opportunity to discuss alternative medical explanations for the test results with the medical review officer (MRO) before the test results are reported to the employer. This includes an opportunity for the employee to discuss what prescribed medication the employee is taking that might influence test results. If a controlled substance is prescribed for an employee by a licensed medical practitioner who is familiar with the employee's medical history and assigned duties, such use shall be an affirmative defense to disqualification under this policy.
Any employee refusing to submit to testing under this section of the policy shall be treated as if the employee has tested positive for a controlled substance.
Individual test results shall not be released by the city without the employee's written authorization. Drug and alcohol test results shall be kept separate from the employee's personnel records.
