The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, tree or object.
2.
The importance of the building, structure, site, tree or object to the ambiance of a district.
3.

In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. The commission shall consider the following factors for any variance requested:

(2)
Whether or not the necessary improvements could be made over a specified period of time in order to minimize the economic hardship of compliance with this chapter;
(3)
Impact of the variance on adjacent properties and the likelihood of future requests for similar variances and whether allowing a variance would compromise the integrity of the property or surrounding properties;

(j)
Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness.

Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness.
(1)
In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefore, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the applicant and administrative officers charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.

Sec. 62-6. - Maintenance of historic properties.
(a)
Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness.
(b)
Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair; deterioration neglect. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect.
(1)
The commission and city staff shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and exterior openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, or the deterioration of a building's structural system, shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Owners shall maintain their structures so as not to endanger the property by permitting the following conditions or other similar conditions which jeopardize structural integrity.
a.
Foundations. Deteriorated or inadequate foundations jeopardize structural integrity. All foundations shall support the structure as originally constructed, and at all points shall be free of holes, wide cracks, and buckling.
b.
Structural members. Defective or deteriorated floor supports, or any structural members of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Members of walls, partitions, or other vertical supports that split, lean, list or buckle due to defective material or deterioration jeopardize structural integrity. Structural members of ceilings and roofs, or other horizontal structural members, which sag, split or buckle due to defective materials or deterioration or are of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Interior staircases shall be maintained in good repair.
c.
Exterior surfaces and materials. Floors, exterior walls and roofs having holes, wide cracks and loose, warped, protruding or rotting boards or any other condition admitting moisture or other elements jeopardize structural integrity. Exterior surfaces exposed to the weather shall be repaired and weatherproofed, where appropriate to protect them from further deterioration. Masonry joints shall be maintained. Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge or settle due to defective material or deterioration, or are of insufficient size or strength to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity.
d.
Weather protection and ventilation. Lack of weather protection, any fault or defect in the building which renders it structurally unsafe or not weather-tight jeopardizes structural integrity. Windows, exterior doors and exterior siding shall be watertight. Exterior flashing, including that at chimneys, doors, and windows, shall be maintained in good repair. Down spouts and gutters shall be maintained in good repair. Proper ventilation for crawl and attic spaces shall be maintained.
e.

The owner or parties in interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying the city within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this subsection;
b.
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city at the time of the sale, transfer or conveyance; and
c.
Should the amount of such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of such three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for repair of dwellings, buildings or other structures in the same manner as provided for the collection of municipal property taxes, as permitted by applicable state statutes.
