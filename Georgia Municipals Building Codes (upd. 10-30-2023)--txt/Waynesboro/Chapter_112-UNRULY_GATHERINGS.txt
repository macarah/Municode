When the police department intervenes at a gathering which constitutes a nuisance under this chapter, the premises at which such nuisance occurred shall be posted with a notice stating that the intervention of the police has been necessitated as a result of a public nuisance under this chapter caused by an event at the premises, the date of the police intervention, and that any subsequent event within the period set forth below on the same premises, which necessitates police intervention, shall result in the joint and several liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, or any persons who own or are residents of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, or who sponsored the event constituting the public nuisance as more fully set forth below. Any notice posted shall remain posted for a rolling calendar year from the date the police department intervenes. For example, a notice posted on July 30 shall remain posted until July 29 of the following year.

The notice posted under this section shall be no less than eight inches x 14 inches in size and shall be neon green in color. The notice shall be constructed of a durable, weather resistant, adhesive material. The notice shall be affixed to the dwelling or structure and shall be posted in a conspicuous place. The police chief or his designee shall determine the location in which such notice is posted in order to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display.
(c)
The residents and owner of such property shall be jointly responsible for ensuring that such notice is not removed or defaced and it shall be a code violation carrying a penalty of a minimum, mandatory $100.00 fine in addition to any other penalties which may be due under this chapter if such notice is removed, obscured or defaced.

(Ord. No. 2016-10-01, § 3, 11-28-2016)
Sec. 112-4. - Persons liable for subsequent response to gathering constituting a public nuisance.
(a)
If the police department is required to respond to a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the premises during any posting periods set forth in subsection 112-2(a), the following persons shall be jointly and severally liable for fines as set forth below:
(1)
The person or persons who own the property where the gathering constituting the public nuisance took place, provided that notice has been mailed to the owner of the property as set forth herein and the gathering occurs at least 14 days after the mailing of such notice.
(2)
The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the property where such gathering took place.
(3)
The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering.
(4)
All persons attending such gatherings who engage in any activity resulting in the public nuisance.
(5)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises, including landlords who are actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.
(b)
Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section.
(Ord. No. 2016-10-01, § 3, 11-28-2016)
