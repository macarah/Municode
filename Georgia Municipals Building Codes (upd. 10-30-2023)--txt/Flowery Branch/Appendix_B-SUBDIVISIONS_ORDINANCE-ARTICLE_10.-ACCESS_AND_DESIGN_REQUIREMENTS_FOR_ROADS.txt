ARTICLE 10. - ACCESS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR ROADS

Sec. 1001. - Access.
(a)
Every development and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a public street meeting the requirements of this Article or an approved private street meeting the requirements of Article 11 of this Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
(b)
Every development and every subdivision shall have access to the public street system via a paved roadway.
(c)
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
(d)
No subdivision or development shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
Sec. 1002. - Conformance With Comprehensive Plan.
All roads and other features of the adopted comprehensive plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and, if any, to the dimensions indicated in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan adopted by the Mayor and City Council of Flowery Branch.
Sec. 1003. - Continuation of Existing Streets.
Streets existing at the property line of a subdivision or land development, or which terminate within the boundaries of a subdivision or land development, shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The Zoning Administrator may waive this requirement in instances where in his or her opinion such continuation or extension would be undesirable or incompatible with surroundings.
Where, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property through the subdivision or land development.
Sec. 1004. - Tract Plan for Future Roads and Phases.
Where the land proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future road system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision or land development consideration shall be required by the Zoning Administrator. When such tentative plan is required, it shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer at the time of submission of an application for preliminary plat or development plan approval, whichever occurs first.
Sec. 1005. - Road Names.
Road names shall be reviewed for correct usage and reasonable meanings consistent with the language used and are subject to the approval of the Mayor and City Council after recommendation from the Zoning Administrator and 911 Coordinator. For instance, the term "parkway" shall not be appropriate for an undivided, two-lane road. Roads that are a continuation of or in alignment with existing named roads shall be given the name of the existing road. Names of new roads shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing roads in the City or County, regardless of the use of any suffix such as "road," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," "way," "court," or other designation.
Sec. 1006. - Improvements along Existing Roads and Highways.
Any subdivision or development with property fronting on an existing city street, county public road or state highway may be required to provide road improvements in order to bring the street, road, or highway into conformance with the applicable standards specified in this Ordinance.
In such cases, in lieu of design and construction by the subdivider or developer, at the discretion of the Mayor and City Council of Flowery Branch, the subdivider or developer shall escrow the dollar equivalency of required improvements (including curbing, utility relocation, and drainage structures) as estimated by the developer and verified by the City Engineer. These funds shall be deposited in the appropriate road construction account prior to the approval of a final plat for a subdivision or prior to issuance of a development permit for a land development, or within 30 days of city, county, or state award of construction contract, whichever occurs first.
For subdivisions or land developments accessing state routes, the Georgia Department of Transportation may require a driveway permit and the installation of deceleration lanes per its Regulations for Driveways and Encroachment Control.
Sec. 1007. - Development Along Arterial Street or Limited Access Highway.
Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an arterial street or a limited access highway, the Mayor and City Council may require a street to be constructed approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, from which the lots or land development shall be accessed instead of the arterial street or limited access highway. In such cases, the subdivision or land development shall require a ten-foot-wide no-access easement planted to prohibit travel across it.
Sec. 1008. - Separation of New Streets along Arterial Street.
Subdivision streets that intersect an arterial street shall do so at intervals of not less than 800 feet, or as required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, whichever is greater.
Sec. 1009. - Road Alignment, Intersections, and Jogs.
Roads shall be aligned to join with planned or existing roads. Under normal conditions, roads shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in no case shall such a road intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 150 feet.
Sec. 1010. - Bridges.
Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards or other standard adopted by the Mayor and City Council of Flowery Branch.
Sec. 1011. - Road and Traffic Control Signs.
Road and traffic control signs shall be provided and installed by the subdivider along new public roads. The Zoning Administrator may require the installation of such signs by the City after the payment of fees to the City for the installation thereof.
All land developments shall be provided with traffic control signs (e.g., speed limits, direction of travel, etc.) if necessary, subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
Sec. 1012. - Reference to Other Improvement Specifications.
Minimum rights-of-way, paving widths, and other requirements for improvement shall be in accordance with minimum standards specified in this Ordinance, unless otherwise specifically provided in this Ordinance. In the absence of specific standards for roads and/or improvements within public rights-of-way, however, such unspecified materials and methods of construction shall be in accordance with one or more of the following standards incorporated by reference:
Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this ordinance, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to one or more of the following as appropriate and applicable:
(a)
The latest standard specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation;
(b)
The latest edition of AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets; and/or
(c)

Sec. 1013. - Alleys.
Alleys shall be required at the rear of all lots in traditional neighborhood developments and may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial or industrial developments. Alleys may be provided in one or two-family residential developments. Standards for the construction of alleys shall be consistent with those specified in Table 10.1.
Sec. 1014. - Road Right-of-Way Widths and Miters.
Standards for the new road rights-of-way shall be consistent with those specified in Table 10.1. The minimum required right-of-way width for a City Street or private road shall be fifty (50) feet, unless otherwise specifically provided in this Article. Wider rights-of-way (i.e., minimum 60 feet) shall be required by the Mayor and City Council for new City Streets serving commercial and industrial subdivisions, or in cases where the Transportation Element of the City of Flowery Branch Comprehensive Plan calls for a larger right-of-way for a road of the same functional classification proposed by the subdivider.
In addition to the specified right-of-way widths, the City may require right-of-way miters at all intersections to provide area for adequate utility location and maintenance. Twenty (20) foot miters shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of any state highway. Ten (10) foot miters shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of a county public road if less than an eighty (80) foot right-of-way exists.
Where existing County public roads or city streets abut a subdivision or land development, unless otherwise specifically provided by this Article, the right-of-way width shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, and the subdivider or developer shall dedicate to the owner of the public road or city street one-half of the required right-of-way, as measured from the centerline of the road, along the entire property frontage.

Grading of full width. All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full width by the developer so that pavement extensions or sidewalks, where required or if installed in the future, can be constructed on the same level plane.
(b)
Clearing. Before grading is started the entire area to be paved shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the developer shall stockpile the topsoil later to be spread in all disturbed areas not paved.
(c)
Slopes and shoulder improvements. The maximum slope for all fill or cut slopes shall be 2 feet of run for each 1 foot of rise or fall. The minimum width for all shoulders on local or collector streets from back edge of the curb shall be 11 feet. All shoulders shall slope one-fourth (¼) inch to the foot toward the roadway. When all construction is completed, all slopes and shoulders shall be cleared of all rubbish and shall have a stand of grass to prevent undue erosion, either by sprigging or seeding. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line.
(d)
Protection of banks. Immediately after grading and filling and re-spreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized and seeded (or in steep areas sodded or otherwise appropriately treated) with suitable vegetative cover to prevent erosion.
(e)
Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved, the curb lines shall be staked by the developer's Registered Land Surveyor. Before any base is applied, all of the underground utilities that are to be located under the roadway are to be installed completely or otherwise provided in accordance with City requirements. Utilities shall be properly located in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
(f)
Authorization. No private improvements, such as private lawn sprinkler systems, yard lighting, and the like, shall be installed within a public right-of-way except by authorization of the City Engineer. Such authorization, if issued, shall require the owner to assume all repair costs of the owner's and the City's facilities should they become damaged.
(g)
Preparation of subgrade. Prior to placement of the street base, the subgrade shall be compacted to 95% standard proctor.
(h)
Curbing. Curbing shall be installed by the developer in accordance with the requirements and standards of this Article. All streets shall be provided with a combination curb and gutter of 3,000 psi Portland cement concrete, or with a header curb of the same material at median or cul-de-sac islands.

_____
_____
As an alternative to sidewalks, developments in conservation subdivisions may, with the approval of the Mayor and City Council, include common pedestrian paths constructed of pervious surfacing materials such as gravel, brick dust, mulch, or other similar surface. Such paths should follow routes that are desirable and appropriate for the individual landscape. An easement should be established, where feasible, in order to ensure the long-term accessibility of the path.
Sec. 1025. - Location of Utilities in Streets.
(a)
Above-Ground Utilities. Telephone poles, street light poles, telephone junction boxes and other public or private utility structures placed above ground within a street right-of-way must be at least 8 feet back from the back of the street curb and 1 foot back from the edge of the sidewalk, whichever is farthermost from the roadway.

  Water and gas mains must be placed on opposite sides of the street. All utilities that will cross under pavement shall be installed completely throughout the subdivision prior to any roadway base being applied. Installation of approved utility sleeves shall be considered as an alternate.
Sec. 1026. - Street Lights.
Street lights may be provided in accordance with City specifications by the developers of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the City and by the utility company that will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than thirty (30) feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the Zoning Administrator. Fixtures shall be located no more than five hundred (500) feet apart, unless approved by the Zoning Administrator, and, when provided, at least one light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development.
The developer shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights, as well as arrange an agreement with the utility company for complete maintenance of all installations. The City of Flowery Branch may assume the responsibility for publicly dedicated city streets and make the monthly payments to the power company for electrical energy for each street light only after these requirements have been accomplished and improvements accepted by the Mayor and City Council of Flowery Branch. Maintenance and operation costs of street lights will be assumed by the City no earlier than two years after lights have been installed.
Sec. 1027. - Street Trees.
(a)
When required. Street tree planting is strongly encouraged if not required for the character area in which the subdivision or land development is located. Street trees may be permitted within the rights-of-way of new public streets and private streets within commercial, industrial, or residential subdivisions, subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
(b)
Plan submittal and approval. When street trees are to be provided, the subdivider, owner of land to be dedicated as a public street, or the developer of a private street shall at the time of preliminary plat approval submit a plan for the provision of street trees along all said roads which shall be subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
(c)
Installation. It is the intent of this Section that where street trees are provided the subdivider or developer should carefully position street trees on the plan while taking into account sidewalk locations, utility locations, and, if not constructed simultaneously with the construction of the public or private street, future driveways. When street trees are provided, the subdivider or developer shall install said street trees, according to a plan approved by the Zoning Administrator as a part of preliminary plat approval or land development permit approval, and prior to dedication or opening of said street. The Zoning Administrator may accept an agreement by the subdivider where the responsibility for street tree planting is shifted to the owners or individual builders of the lots to be subdivided, upon their development. Any such responsibility shall be legally transferred in a form acceptable to the City Attorney.
(d)
Location. Street trees must be planted within the public or private right-of-way or, if right-of-way width is insufficient to accommodate said street trees, then on private property within a street tree easement dedicated to the city.
(e)
Requirements and guidelines.
(1)
Size. When planted, street trees should be provided the greatest amount of growing area possible. The city encourages selection and planting of medium and large canopy trees (at maturity) so long as there is adequate room for planting to allow tree and root growth, without conflict with utilities and paved surfaces, including sidewalks.
(2)
Species selection. Selected trees are classified by size of canopy in Table 10.8. The applicant for street tree plan approval may propose other species than those listed in Table 10.8. The city encourages the selection of both urban-tolerant and native trees, as specified in Table 10.8.
(3)
Minimum tree lawn and minimum open soil surface area. No street tree shall be planted unless it has a minimum of five feet in width by five feet in length of open, unobstructed soil surface area. To ensure adequate growing area for street trees, each street tree planted shall be provided a minimum open soil surface area of 25 square feet for very small canopy, 75 square feet for small canopy, 225 square feet for medium canopy, and 400 square feet for large canopy trees. Street tree plans shall demonstrate compliance with these requirements. To meet the minimum soil surface area, private property adjacent to the right-of-way may be included if unobstructed. Tree grates above open soil surface areas may be proposed and permitted.
(4)
Planting locations restricted. Street trees shall not be planted within: thirty (30) feet of the intersection of public or private streets; twenty (20) feet of street light and utility poles; ten (10) feet of existing walls, fences, signs, driveways, or fire hydrants; or five (5) feet of existing underground utility corridors and sidewalks.
(5)
Spacing. Street trees shall be spaced at intervals appropriate considering the canopy size and height of the tree at maturity. Generally, this means that there should be a minimum spacing of 15 feet for very small canopy, 20 feet for small canopy, 40 feet for medium canopy, and 60 feet or more for large canopy trees at maturity.
(6)
Overhead power or utility lines. When street trees are proposed to be planted underneath or within five (5) feet of overhead power lines or utilities, only those trees classified as "very small" or "small" in Table 10.8 may be planted. Additionally, underneath or near overhead power lines or utilities, only those species indicated with an "X" or "XX" (i.e., good or especially good) with regard to utility corridors in Table 10.8 should be planted.
(7)
Root barriers. The street tree plan shall propose, and the Zoning Administrator shall require, the installation of root barriers, in accordance with manufacturer's specifications, when trees are planted within five feet of a sidewalk, curb, paved surface, or underground utility corridor. Street trees installed between a sidewalk and curb and gutter shall require root barriers along both the sidewalk and the curb. Street trees installed between an underground utility corridor and a sidewalk, shall require root barriers along both the utility corridor and the sidewalk. The street tree plan shall identify all street trees that require installation of root barriers. The linear distance of the root barrier shall be determined based on the critical root zone of the tree at maturity but in most instances shall be no less than 5 feet in length (2.5' feet from the trunk of the tree in each direction) adjacent to the improvement to be protected.
(8)
Material and depth specifications for root barriers. Street tree root barriers can be made of durable high-density polyethylene or thick plastic, metal, or herbicide-impregnated cloth, buried vertically in the soil. Effective depths depend upon soil texture. At least 12 inches in vertical depth is required for protection. Install root barriers by trenching along the area to be protected. Installers shall make all necessary effort to use best management practices in addressing the potential damage to a sidewalk, curb, paved surface or underground utility by root invasion.
