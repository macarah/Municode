Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
State Law reference— Giving massages in places used for lewdness, prostitution, assignation or masturbation for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-17; restriction of adult bookstores and movie houses to certain areas, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1.

Sec. 5-1. - Authority.
Pursuant to the city's Charter section 1.3, the city has all powers possible for a city to have under the present or future Constitution and laws of the state. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3, the city is authorized to adopt reasonable ordinances, resolutions or regulations relating to its property, affairs and local government. In particular, the city is authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3 to enact ordinances which shall have the effect of restricting the operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, which is a proper exercise of the city's police powers. However, nothing in O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3 shall be construed so as to prohibit the adoption by the city council of restrictions relating to the location of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses which are more stringent than the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3.
(Ord. No. 360, § 1, 12-18-2007)
Sec. 5-2. - Findings.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other cities and counties, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas, and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced in Flowery Branch, Georgia, and based on documentary evidence submitted to the city council, the city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within the United States of America.
(b)
The city council also relies on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); and Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F.3d 860 (2007), including, but not limited to, the following:
(1)
Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no mechanism other than the regulations in this chapter to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2)
Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
(3)
Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
(4)
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5)
Persons frequent certain adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment establishments.
(6)
At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(7)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(8)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult entertainment establishment. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(9)
Requiring licensees of adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(10)
The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
(c)
It is the finding of the city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
(d)
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are the depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of an expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection. The city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well.
(e)
Furthermore, the city council finds that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
(f)
The city council finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells videotapes depicting sexual activities.
(g)
The city council finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, churches, schools, residential areas, children's day care facilities and public parks to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. The city council finds that the regulations in this chapter promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions, and further finds and intends that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression.
(h)
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to permit or condone any activity whatsoever which is otherwise found to be obscene, lewd or illegal under applicable laws which provide any prohibition upon nudity or sexual activity. Further, the activities and uses which are regulated by this chapter shall only be allowed if they are not obscene or lewd and not in violation of any other such prohibitions on nudity or sexual activity.
