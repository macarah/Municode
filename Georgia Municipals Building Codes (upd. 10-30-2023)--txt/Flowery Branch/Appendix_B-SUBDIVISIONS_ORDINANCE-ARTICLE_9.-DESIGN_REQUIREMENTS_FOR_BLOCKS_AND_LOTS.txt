ARTICLE 9. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR BLOCKS AND LOTS

Sec. 901. - Block Lengths and Widths.
Intersecting roads shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic and connectivity. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed one thousand eight hundred (1800) feet nor be less than six hundred (600) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions (including character area designation) justify a departure from these standards. In blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of blocks.
_____
The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-road parking and deliveries.
Sec. 902. - Lot Size, Width, and Depth.
Lots shall meet any minimum area requirements established by the City of Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance. Where individual septic tanks are permitted, lots shall meet minimum lot sizes to conform to health standards of the state of Georgia as approved by the Hall County Environmental Health Department, or the minimum lot size of the City of Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance, whichever is greater.
Residential lots should have a depth not greater than three (3) times the width of the lot at the building line, unless unusual circumstances make these limitations not practicable. Residential corner lots should have widths to meet adequate or required building setbacks from both abutting roads.
Commercial and industrial or other non-residential lots should be adequate to provide service areas and off-road parking suitable to use intended.
Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or any required yards/building setback lines.
Sec. 903. - Lot Lines.
All lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to road lines, unless not practicable because of topographic or other features.
Sec. 904. - Double Frontage Lots.
Double frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation.
A no-access, planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
Sec. 905. - Flag Lots.
(a)
Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this Ordinance, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be approved where conditions of hardship make standard design or frontage impossible or impractical due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided.
(b)
Denial if reasonable alternative exists. The City shall have due cause to deny any preliminary or final plat that proposes any flag lot, when a reasonable alternative to such lot pattern is available.
(c)
Panhandle (flag pole) length restriction. If permitted, no flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a "panhandle" portion (i.e., portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than 400 feet in length.
(d)
Prohibition of abutting flag lots. If permitted, no flag lot shall abut another flag lot in any subdivision.
Sec. 906. - Lot Remnants Not Permitted.
All remnants of lots below any minimum lot size that may be required, left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The Zoning Administrator may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose, such as a detention pond, provided that access and design are appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to a specific non-building use, with said restrictions recorded on the final plat.
Sec. 907. - Monuments.
For all subdivisions, a Georgia registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than ½" in diameter and 18" in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of Sec. 180-7-.05, "Monuments" of the Rules of State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers & Land Surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act (O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67).
