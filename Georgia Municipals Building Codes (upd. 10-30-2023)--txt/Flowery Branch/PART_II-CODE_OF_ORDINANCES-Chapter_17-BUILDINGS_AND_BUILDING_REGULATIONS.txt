A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes.

In addition, he shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official and consistent with all applicable local and state laws.

Prior ordinances of the city which require certain technical or specific construction specifications as to both design and construction to be done within the city are hereby amended to allow the city council to designate the city engineer, or other proper duly authorized agent, to perform the review and approval of said technical and construction specifications as to design and construction. However, nothing herein shall permit or approve any such agent for the city to make any final zoning decision, or other decisions specifically required by law to be made by the governing authority.

Further, the failure of any applicant to pay the fees and expenses for the review and approval of any agent for the city shall authorize the city to withhold its approval and any permits needed by said applicant, until such time as applicant has completely paid the fees and expenses incurred by the city for the review and approved by the duly authorized agent.
(Ord. No. 358, § 5, 4-18-2007)
Sec. 17-99. - Additional time to allow review and approval by agent of the city.
Whenever previous ordinances provide for certain time periods for approvals of buildings/structures, proposed subdivision plats, line construction, road construction, structures, and other improvements, or design of any subdivision or improvement, or any combination thereof, said time periods are hereby extended for an additional 60 days in order to allow the properly designated agent for the city to conduct the review, inspection, and approval process regarding the design or improvement to be reviewed and approved.
