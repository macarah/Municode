(1)
The experience of other areas, including but not limited to, the City of Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Los Angeles, California, demonstrate that the notorious conditions attaching to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity do not vary greatly by geographic location.
(2)
Recent developments in the county indicate that our county shares the experiences of other areas for which comprehensive statistical studies have been performed.
(3)
Live public human nudity (either partial or total), particularly in conjunction with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages tends to beget criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions.
(4)
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and other sex offenses, and drug offenses.
(5)
Among the undesirable community conditions identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior, a decrease in the desirability of such areas for residential use, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas.
(6)
Evidence drawn from personal experiences of Baldwin County law enforcement officers indicate similar types of criminal behavior associated with these establishments which is of concern to the governing authority.
(7)
It is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to reduce the adverse impacts of live commercial human nudity associated with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages by redefining those portions of the county ordinances relating to these concerns.
