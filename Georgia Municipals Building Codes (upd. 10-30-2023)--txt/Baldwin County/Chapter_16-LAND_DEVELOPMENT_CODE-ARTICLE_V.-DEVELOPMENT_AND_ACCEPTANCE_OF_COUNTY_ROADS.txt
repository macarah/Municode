Sec. 16-63. - General provisions.
(a)
County road classifications. Roads within the county are hereby classified according to their inherent and relative function.
(1)
Residential land service road. A public road or right-of-way therefor which is not under the jurisdictional control of the State of Georgia, nor intended for such control, and which is not considered to be significant to intra-county vehicular travel, and which provides or is intended to provide vehicular access to land in use or intended for use primarily for residential purposes.
(2)
Nonresidential land service road. A public road or right-of-way therefor which is not under the jurisdictional control of the State of Georgia, nor intended for such control, and which is not considered to be significant to intra-county vehicular travel, and which provides or is intended to provide access to land in use or intended for use primarily for commercial and industrial purposes, or which accommodates or is intended to accommodate frequent vehicular traffic to land areas whose use or intended use is primarily for such purposes.
(3)
County vehicular service road. A public road or right-of-way therefor which is not under the jurisdictional control of the State of Georgia and which is considered to be significant to intra-county vehicular travel.
(4)
State route. A public road or right-of-way therefor which is under the jurisdictional control of the State of Georgia, or is intended for such control and acceptable to the state for such control.
(5)
Private driveway. Drive or any designated right-of-way or easement therefor, for vehicular access from public rights-of-way to private property, which are not under the jurisdictional control of the state nor intended or acceptable for such control, and which is not owned and maintained or intended to be owned and maintained by the county as a public road.
(b)
Classification authority. The county commission shall have the authority to classify all roads and road rights-of-way within the county that are owned by the county or which are subject to county maintenance by public use and designation. The classification of all such roads and road rights-of-way as shall have existed and been mapped upon the effective date of this code shall be as identified on the Road Classification Map of Baldwin County, Georgia as shall have been prepared and adopted by the county commission.
The county commission shall classify all new or proposed roads and road rights-of-way. Until such time as a new or proposed road or road right-of-way shall have been classified by the county commission, it shall be deemed a private drive and shall not be represented as anything but a private drive and therefore not subject to improvements and maintenance as a public road.
No new or proposed road or road right-of-way shall be accepted and approved as a public road until and after it shall have been classified by the county commission in a manner consistent with the provisions of this code.
( Ord. of 12-3-2019(2) )
Sec. 16-64. - Standards for public road design.
(a)
County road system. All new or extended roads shall be designed and constructed to complement the existing or planned system of county roads. To this end, the county commission shall have the authority to specify the location, width, and alignment of all new roads or rights-of-way therefor as may be proposed or offered for public ownership, development, and/or maintenance.
The county commission may also require the reservation or dedication of right-of-way within lands proposed for subdivision development, as provided for in this code and Article IV, as the county commission deems necessary to extend, widen, or otherwise improve an existing public road or right-of-way therefor, or to provide for the future extension of a new public road to serve properties abutting or adjacent to the land to be subdivided.
(b)
Width of roads and rights-of way. The minimum width of new or extended public road right-of-way wearing surfaces, and shoulders shall be as follows.
(1)
Residential land service road. Minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet, wearing surface width of 24 feet, and shoulder width minimum of five feet.
(2)
Nonresidential land service road. Right-of-way width of 80 feet, wearing surface width of 24 feet, and shoulder width minimum of five feet.
(3)
County vehicular service road. Right-of-way width of 80 feet, wearing surface width of 24 feet, and shoulder width minimum of five feet.
(4)
State route. As required by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(5)
Private drive. No prescribed minimums.
(c)
Vertical alignment of roads. In no case shall roadway grades exceed ten percent nor be less than one-half of one percent. The county commission may reduce the maximum gradient for nonresidential land service roads.
(d)
Horizontal alignment of roads. The radius of road curvature shall be not less than 90 feet, except that the county commission may increase this minimum radius for nonresidential land service roads. Curve radii shall be measured from the road centerline.
(e)
Intersection. All roads shall intersect at right angles unless prevented by unusual site characteristics. In such cases, the county commission may approve a lesser intersecting angle or require the relocation of the intersection. Road jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted.
( Ord. of 12-3-2019(2) )
Sec. 16-65. - Standards for public road improvement.
The following improvements shall be made before the county commission may accept a residential or nonresidential land service road and right-of-way therefor for public ownership and maintenance. Wherever a specification of the Georgia Department of Transportation is referred to in this article said reference is made to the appropriate section of the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, current edition, as thereafter amended and supplemented.
(a)
Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all rights-of-way shall be shaped to approximate required grades, alignment, and other specifications such that base and wearing surfaces can be constructed, which will not damage abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees and other vegetative matter not impairing visibility.
Before grading is started, the entire area of the right-of-way shall be cleared of all exposed stumps, logs, grass, weeds, roots, rubbish, loose boulders, and other debris or otherwise objectionable material protruding through the ground surface.
All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions shall be removed to a minimum depth of two feet below the finished surface of all slopes and the area to which base material is to be applied. Rock whenever encountered shall be scarified or removed to a depth of 12 inches below the subgrade.
All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed 12 inches loose and compacted by a sheepsfoot roller. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped.
(b)
Embankments and erosion control. Immediately after grading and filling and respreading of topsoil, all shoulders and slopes within the right-of-way shall be stabilized to retard erosion and drainage facilities open or temporary slope drains constructed to accommodate and direct acceptable surface water runoff, all to be in compliance with the Baldwin County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. At a minimum, developer shall provide permanent-type grassing.
(c)
Ditches and drains. Each road and road right-of-way shall have a drainage system adequate to provide for the proper drainage of all surface water.
Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow and shall be of sufficient length to permit the full width of the required roadway, including shoulders and ditch slopes.
Size openings of all cross drains shall be as required by the county public works supervisor. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on a firm base, but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with spigot ends pointing in the direction of the water flow. Ends shall be properly fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth, uniform invert. Drains shall be placed at sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the drain pipe be less than one foot below the roadway base.
Drainage ditches shall be constructed along both sides of the roadway. All ditches shall be two feet deep and have an invert of two feet. The front slope of the ditch shall have a horizontal-to-vertical slope ratio of not less than 3:1, and a back slope of not less than 2:1. All ditches shall be stabilized to retard erosion.
Concrete, corrugated metal or plastic (if approved) side drains with size openings of not less than 15 inches shall be installed to provide for surface water drainage under all driveways.
(d)
Roadway base and shoulder. The base material shall extend not less than one foot beyond the paving edge. The minimum type of roadway base and shoulder material allowed shall be topsoil, sand-clay, crusher run stone, or chert which shall have physical properties equivalent to that required for Class B material gradation contained in Georgia D.O.T. Specifications.
For residential land service roads the roadway and shoulder base shall have a minimum compacted depth of six inches and a 100 percent dry density compaction. For nonresidential land service roads the corresponding minimum compacted depth shall be a minimum of six inches and a 100 percent dry density compaction.
(e)
Prime coat. All finished base surfaces shall have a bituminous prime coat applied before surface treatment material is spread. The minimum acceptable prime coat material shall be cutback asphalt of a grade as required by the county public works supervisor based on temperature and the texture of the base surface.
The prime coat shall be applied at the rate of 0.25 of a gallon per square yard of base. Application of the prime coat shall be consistent with Georgia D.O.T. Specifications.
Surface treatment: After prime coat has been properly cured, a permanent wearing surface shall be applied to the roadway base.
For residential land service roads, the minimum acceptable wearing surface shall consist of Type I bituminous treatment using stone, size 5, aggregate with a bituminous seal using stone, size 7 and 89, shall conform to the provisions of Georgia D.O.T. Specifications.
(f)
Concrete paving. Concrete paving may be used as an alternative subject to the following minimum county specifications:
(1)
Any subgrade on which concrete is placed directly shall meet soil requirements for a class I or class II soil. A III A soil would be acceptable provided it is stabilized with a minimum of 150 pounds per square yard of crusher run stone. (A minimum of six inches in depth is required of all base material.) One hundred percent compaction using standard density is required.
(2)
A five-inch concrete slab is required that uses a 5.75 bags/CYD mixture and provides 3,500 pounds per square inch minimum compression strength and approximately a minimum average strength of 4,300 pounds per square inch, to be compatible with a modulas of rupture 550 P.S.I. If concrete paving is placed without tied in concrete shoulders or curbs, at least one-half inche of slab thickness is required to insure compliance with minimum compression a minimum average strength requirements provided herein.
(3)
Transverse joints should not be spaced further apart than 15 feet.
(4)
All other road preparation and construction requirements not in conflict with these specific requirements shall be required for the use of concrete paving as an alternate.
(5)
Not less than a ten-day notice of use of this alternative shall be given to the county by written notice to the county clerk.
(g)
Control of work and inspections. The county public works supervisor shall have the authority to control the construction of all residential and nonresidential land service roads. In exercising such authority, the county public works supervisor shall decide all questions concerning the acceptability of materials and construction methods. The county public works supervisor shall have the authority to inspect all construction work done and materials used to determine compliance with the provisions of this article. Whenever the county public works supervisor finds that materials and/or work performed are not in compliance with this code, he may require the removal, replacement, or otherwise require the correction of the nonconformity. The county public works supervisor, however may, not waive or reduce the requirements of any provisions of this code.
(h)
Guarantee in lieu of completed improvements. No new or extended residential or nonresidential land service road shall be approved and accepted by the county commission for public ownership and maintenance, and no subdivision plat containing such a road shall be given final approval until one of the following conditions shall have been met.
(1)
All roads, right-of-way and drainage facilities are designed and constructed consistent with the provisions of this article and so approved by the county public works supervisor; or
(2)
The county commission shall have accepted a surety bond in an amount equal to one and one-half times the estimated cost of all required road, right-of-way, and drainage facility improvements, so that if the builder defaults, required improvements may be made by the county commission without using public funds therefor. The county commission shall determine the estimated cost of required improvements.
(i)
Maintenance bond. Prior to acceptance of road and/or drainage improvements, the land owner shall provide a suitable maintenance bond approved by county to assure that said roadway and/or drainage improvements are still in full compliance with county requirements for two years from the date of acceptance of the road and/or drainage improvements. The maintenance bond shall be in an amount equal to not less than $50,000.00 per mile or portion thereof. For example, a road of 0.6 miles in length requires not less than a $50,000.00 bond and a road of 1.4 miles in length requires not less than a $100,000.00 bond. When, in the opinion of the code administrator and the county engineer or county road superintendent, the nature of the roadway and/or improvements are such as to require a bond of greater amount, the said administrator and engineer or superintendent shall establish such an amount and provide to the land owner written explanation for such a requirement.
(j)
Traffic control signs, street name signs, and striping. Prior to the transfer of any lots or the acceptance of any road and or drainage improvements, the land owner shall provide payment in full to Baldwin County for the cost of all traffic control signs and street (name) signs. Owner shall also provide the cost of center and edge line striping.
