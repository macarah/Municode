In its interpretation and application, the provisions of this code shall be considered minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience, order, and general welfare.
(b)
Completion of existing buildings. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, designated use, or occupancy of a building or structure for which:
(1)
There is physical evidence that construction had commenced under a valid building permit prior to the effective date of this code and where the entire building or structure shall be completed within one year from the effective date of this code; or
(2)
A building permit had been issued pursuant to the requirements of previous development regulations as may have been modified or repealed by this code and where the entire building or structure should be completed within six months from the effective date of this code.
(c)
Violations and remedies. A violation of any provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of it requirements, including violations of performance standards or a grant of variance, or a violation of any lawful order of the code enforcement administrator is hereby declared to be a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof shall be punishable as provided by law. Each and every day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
The owner or tenant of any land, building, structure, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent the county, or any property owner who would be specifically damaged by such violation, from taking such other lawful action, including civil action, as necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(d)
Enforcing officer. The provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced by the administrator. The administrator shall have the right to enter upon any property or into any building or structure for the purpose of making inspections as necessary to carry out his duties in the enforcement of this article.
The administrator shall issue all building permits and make and maintain records of permits issued or denied, or inspections made, or any violations cited and remedies ordered, and of any appeal proceedings.
(e)
Required building permit. Except as otherwise provided in this article, it shall be unlawful to commence the construction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure or to change the use of a building or structure or of land, except changes in agricultural crops, until the administrator shall have issued an applicable permit therefor. Application for an appropriate permit shall be made to the administrator on forms provided for that purpose.
The administrator shall have the authority to require that every application for a building permit contain or be accompanied by sufficient information regarding the lot, parcel, or building site, the use and placement of buildings and structures, thereon, and adjoining properties as may be necessary for the administrator to determine whether or not the proposed activity is in conformity with the provisions of this article.
(f)
Public health certification. The administrator shall not issue a building permit where the proposed building, structure, or use involves on-site means of sewage disposal until the application shall have first obtained the written certification of the county health officer that on-site disposal means can satisfactorily accommodate the expected sewage discharge from the proposed use, and that the site on which the proposed use is located or is to be located contains sufficient land area to accommodate the on-site disposal of the expected discharges without adversely affecting ground or surface water supplies.
(g)
Permit issuance and expiration. If the proposed activity, for which an application has been made for a building permit, has been determined by the administrator to be in conformity with the provisions of this article, the administrator shall issue a building permit authorizing the proposed activity.
The issuance of a building permit shall in no case be construed as waiving any provisions of this code. Building permits shall be void after six months from the date of issuance unless, in the opinion of the administrator, satisfactory progress is made by that time.
(h)
Certificate of compliance. No land or structure for which a building permit has been issued shall be occupied or used until the county building officer shall have issued a certificate of code compliance thereof.
A certificate of compliance shall be issued only when the building, structure, and/or land is determined to be in conformity with the provisions of this code. No certificate of compliance shall be issued for any use of land or structure where on-site means of sewage disposal are employed until the county health officer shall have certified in writing his approval of the installation and operation of such on-site disposal means. If a certificate of compliance is not granted upon request the administrator shall state in writing the reasons for such action, and shall identify any corrections or modifications necessary for compliance certification.
(i)
Disapproval of permit application. Whenever an application for a building permit shall have been disapproved, the administrator shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval and shall notify the applicant immediately of the reasons for disapproval.
Thereafter, the applicant may re-apply for a building permit provided he overcomes, to the satisfaction of the administrator, the causes for previous disapproval, or the applicant may institute appeal proceedings or legal action.

Sec. 16-72. - Intensity of use.
(a)
Minimum lot size. No building or other structure designed or used for human occupancy, congregation, or employment, or otherwise requiring on-site means of sewage disposal, may be used or constructed on any lot, parcel, or tract of land which does not contain at least the following minimum size and lot width at the building line, and for an area which includes the structure and the septic system, unless a home previously was built on the lot, or the adjacent homes' lots were platted on or before July 1, 1991 when applicable:
(1)
As to one single family dwelling per lot:
a.
As to lots which do not have either public/community water or public sewer service one and one-half acres with minimum with of 200 feet; and

d.
As to lots which have both public water and sewerage service and are located in a subdivision which complies with all requirements of the current subdivision regulations and the following additional requirements, one-half acre with a minimum width of 115 feet. Additional minimum requirements to qualify for this exception:
1.
That the subdivision streets include curb and gutter and drainage water structures engineered to comply with applicable DOT regulations regarding stormwater runoff; and
2.
The subdivision is restricted so that only one single family residence may be constructed on each lot and said lots shall be restricted to single family residential use only; and
3.
No lot shall front upon or have direct access onto an existing county, state or federal roadway; and
4.
A buffer strip at least twenty feet wide shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the development including existing public roadways. This buffer may be included within any individual home lot if the lot size is increased by an additional ten feet of depth and the entire 20 feet is restricted as a buffer strip as required herein. This strip shall be planted with evergreen trees and hedge-type shrubs designed to provide full noise and sight screening and shall have no improvements located thereon; and
5.
In addition to the buffer required in paragraph iv.) There shall be set aside for the use and enjoyment of the owners of the subdivision a community park or parks, greenways, or recreational areas of the greater of two acres or one-tenth of an acre for the first 50 lots in the subdivision and one-twentieth of an acre per lot for all lots over 50 in the subdivision, with said area(s) accessible to all of the lots in the subdivision. This set-aside shall include not less than one composite area containing not less than two acres for each 50 lots in the subdivision. For example, a 100-lot subdivision would have one composite area of not less than four acres or two composite areas of not less than two acres each. The remaining greenway may be in the nature of buffer strips between adjacent lots and/or along the rear of the lots. Buffers, common areas, and greenways are intended to enhance the liveability of the subdivision and to benefit the owners thereof. The requirements cannot be met by the set-aside of irregular strips and gores or incidental open spaces which have no realistic use by the proposed residents on a day-to-day basis. To qualify for this exception, the developer must justify the set-asides as consistent with the intent and purpose of these provisions; and
6.
There shall be not less than one entry into the subdivision for each 100 lots or parts thereof. There shall be a buffer strip beginning at the intersection of each subdivision street right-of-way line and each public road right-of-way line.

These covenants shall have provisions regarding the size and nature of improvements, setbacks, building materials, and use consistent with the greater density allowed by this exception. These covenants shall limit dwellings to two stories in height and shall require concrete driveways to service each home. In addition, these covenants shall make provision for the ownership, maintenance and control of the common, recreational, buffer and greenways provided for herein; and
9.
This section provides an exception to the requirement that minimum lot sizes be not less than three-fourths of an acre. To have the benefit of this exception, proposals are expected to exceed the provisions herein, which are minimum requirements. It is the intention that no variances be granted in regard to the minimum requirements provided for herein.

(4)
Lots existing prior to November 6, 1991, may be used for any building purposes provided that the lots are connected to a central or public water supply and provided that the lot complies with the minimum setback lines set forth herein.
(b)
Lot modifications for sanitary purposes. Where individual septic tanks or other such on-site disposal facilities are to be used as a means of sewage disposal, the county health officer may require increases in the minimum lot size as necessary to conform to rules and recommendations of the Georgia Department of Public Health. In no case, however, shall the lot size be reduced to less than the required minimum as established herein.
(c)
Building setbacks. No building or structure shall be located closer than 35 feet to the right-of-way line of any public road nor closer than 75 feet to the centerline of any public road, whichever is the greater distance. As to corner lots, these setbacks shall apply as to both streets except that in the event the side street is local, nonconnector street, then the administrator shall have the authority to reduce the side street setback to not less than the standard side setback line.
No building or structure shall be located closer than 15 feet to any side or rear property line; provided, however, the side and rear setback lines shall be as provided in the restrictive covenants of subdivisions, but in no event less than ten feet.

(1)
Alteration or enlargement. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be altered or enlarged in any manner unless said building structure, including additions and expansion comply with the regulations of this article.
However, a building or structure that is conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to required building setbacks, performance standards, and applicable supplementary regulations, said building or structure may be enlarged or added to, provided that the addition or enlargement fully complies with all applicable requirements.
No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on the same lot or to any other lot unless every portion of said building or structure is made to conform to all applicable provisions of this article.
(2)
Discontinuance of use. After a nonconforming use shall have been discontinued for a period of two years, it shall not be re-established or changed to any use except a conforming use.
No nonconforming use may be discontinued for any period and changed to any other type of nonconforming use.
(3)
Damage to structures. Any nonconforming structure or structure containing a nonconforming use which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or other causes to the extent of 60 percent of its fair market value shall not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with this article.
(4)
Maintenance and repairs. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months or work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming position of the structure, provided that the total floor area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
