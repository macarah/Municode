ARTICLE VII. - CODE OF ETHICS

Sec. 2-291. - Principle policies.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are:
(1)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(2)
The Constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Hampton should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct.
(3)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(4)
Public servants should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their office.
(5)
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.
