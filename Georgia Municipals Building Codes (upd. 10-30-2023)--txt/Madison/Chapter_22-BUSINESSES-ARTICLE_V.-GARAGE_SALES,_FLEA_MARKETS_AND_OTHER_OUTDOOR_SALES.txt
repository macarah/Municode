ARTICLE V. - GARAGE SALES, FLEA MARKETS AND OTHER OUTDOOR SALES

Sec. 22-176. - Intent and purpose.
The mayor and council finds, determines and declares that:
(1)
A garage sale serves as a method by which a residential lessee or homeowner may sell or dispose of unwanted items of personal property and correspondingly provides an opportunity for other persons to purchase bargains;
(2)
The unregulated allowance of garage sales in the city presents an opportunity for abuse in that some persons may be conducting business activities under the guise of having a garage sale;
(3)
The existence of nonregulated and recurring garage sales and flea markets causes annoyance to citizens in the city and congestion of the city's streets;
(4)
This article is adopted for the purpose of prohibiting the infringement of business activities in areas by regulating the term and frequency of garage sales and flea markets so as to prevent the disturbance or disruption of the residential environment throughout the city;
(5)
This article is not intended to prohibit isolated or casual sales by individuals of household or other personal items; and
(6)
The provisions and prohibitions contained in this article are adopted not for the purpose of preventing but for the purpose of regulating the garage sales and flea markets in the city for health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
