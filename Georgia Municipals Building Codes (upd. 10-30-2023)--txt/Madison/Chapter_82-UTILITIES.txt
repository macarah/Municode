The legal liability of company to city and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the liability insurance policy, including without limitation, company's indemnification obligations herein, shall not be limited by such insurance policies nor by the recovery of any amounts thereunder, except to the extent necessary to avoid duplicative recovery from or payment by company. Company shall:
(1)
At its own cost and expense, replace, repair or restore any damaged property substantially to its prior condition; and
(2)
Pay damages determined to be due per any claim against company for any injury to or death of any person caused by any act or failure to act of company, or any officer, employee, agent or contractor of company, in connection with the installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of equipment or the provision of services through the equipment.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit any recovery to which a person may otherwise be entitled, nor shall anything herein be deemed an admission of liability on the part of company.
City and its officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants and independent contractors shall have no liability to company, any affiliated person or any other person for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or other damages as a result of the exercise of any right of city per this article or applicable law. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission of liability by city nor be interpreted to waive any protection for city against liability under the law.
