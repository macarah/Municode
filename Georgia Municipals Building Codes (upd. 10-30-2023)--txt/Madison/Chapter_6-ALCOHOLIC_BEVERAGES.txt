Restaurants. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person may apply as a qualified restaurant even though the establishment has not yet been in operation for the previous 12 months.

If the city anticipates that the establishment will qualify for a license, it may vote to award the applicant a temporary license not to exceed 90 days. At or before the conclusion of the 90-day period, the city shall use a pro rata analysis to determine if the applicant is operating a qualified restaurant.

There shall be a separate application for each special event. The application shall be filed with the city clerk at least 30 days prior to the scheduled special event. The application shall state in detail the nature, location and time of the event.

In the cases of festivals and multi-day events, each festival and multi-day event shall be treated as one special event for the purpose of event approval hereunder.
All requirements of this article which pertain to restaurants, shall also apply to a private club. Provided, however, that if there are any differing standards between this section and the rest of this article, the stricter requirement shall apply.
Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing, the 60 percent non-beer and wine sales and $150,000.00 annual safes requirements shall not apply.
No member, officer, agent or employee may directly or indirectly receive via any compensation or any profits from the sale of beer and wine, other than a fixed salary unrelated to the sale of the beer and wine.
Fixed salary means the amount of compensation paid any member, officer, agent, or employee of a bona fide private club as may be fixed for him by its members at a prior annual meeting or by the governing body out of the general revenue of the club and shall not include any commission on any profits from the sale of beer and wine.
