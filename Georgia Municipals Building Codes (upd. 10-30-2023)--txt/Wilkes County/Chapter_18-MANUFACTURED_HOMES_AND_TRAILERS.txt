ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 18-1. - Enactment clause.
For the purpose of promoting health and general welfare; securing safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; providing adequate light and air; preventing overcrowding of land; preserving the character of the area and its peculiar suitability for particular uses; promoting desirable living conditions; protesting against blight and depreciation; and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and other structures throughout such area, the board of county commissioners does ordain and enact into law the following sections.
(Ord. No. 041389C, art. I, 4-13-1989)
Sec. 18-2. - Short title.
These regulations shall be known as and may be cited as "The Mobile Home Regulations of Wilkes County, Georgia."
Sec. 18-3. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Accessory use means a use customarily incidental to the principal use of the land.
Family means one or more persons occupying a dwelling and living as a single housekeeping unit, as distinguished from persons occupying a house, lodginghouse, or hotel, as herein defined.
Lot means a parcel of land containing a minimum of 43,560 square feet occupied by one or more main buildings and its accessory buildings with such open and parking spaces as are required by the provisions of this chapter and having its frontage upon a public road, public street or streets, having access from a public street or public road.
Mobile home means a movable or portable dwelling unit constructed to be towed on its own chassis, connected to utilities and designed without permanent foundation for year-round occupancy, which can consist of one or more components that can be retracted for towing purposes and subsequently expanded for additional capacity, or two or more units separately towable but designed to be joined into one integral unit. Removal of wheels does not change the classification of said dwelling. Construction of permanent improvements and attachments can change the classification of a mobile home to that of a modular building. The term "mobile home," as used in this chapter, shall have the same meaning as "manufactured home."
Mobile home park means any property on which four or more manufactured homes are located, or intended to be located for purposes of residential or recreational occupancy of a temporary, seasonal, or permanent nature. Mobile home parks must comply with the specific requirements for such parks as delineated in section 24-167.
Modular buildings means a factory fabricated, transportable building consisting of units designed to be incorporated at a building site on a permanent foundation into a permanent structure to be used for residential or commercial purposes. Placement of permanent foundation, porches, roof design and other like factors distinguish a modular building from a mobile home.
Open space means an area which is not used for or occupied by a driveway, off-street parking, loading space, yard or refuse storage space.
Plat means a map, plan or layout of a county, city, town, section, subdivision, or development indicating the location and boundaries of properties.
Principal use means the primary purpose for which land or a building is used.
Right-of-way line means the dividing line between a lot, tract or parcel of land and a contiguous right-of-way.
