DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 4-111. - Directives.
In order for the board of commissioners to accept any streets/roads within Harris County, the following directives shall be complied with:
(1)
The subdivider/owner/developer of proposed streets/roads shall acquire a copy of this article. A copy may be obtained from the following county departments: public works department, community development department, or the county manager's office, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
(2)
Prior to beginning construction on a street/road, the subdivider/owner/developer shall consult with the public works director and submit a set of construction plans. Said plans will be reviewed for compliance; following approval, subdivider/owner/developer may proceed with construction of street/road. No construction will be started until the construction plans have been approved.
(3)
After the subdivider/owner/developer has completed construction of said streets/roads to include striping and the placement of all signs (stop, curve, street signs, etc.), he/she shall forward a letter requesting an inspection by the county public works director.
(4)
Upon receipt of said request, the county public works director or his designee shall conduct an inspection of said streets/roads for compliance with the approved construction plans and the road standards contained within this article.
(5)
After the inspection has been accomplished, the public works director shall complete an inspection report and forward the original to the board of commissioners and a copy to the subdivider/owner/developer. This report will indicate any deficiencies noted and what the subdivider/owner/developer must correct/complete prior to the recommendation of acceptance by the public works director. If there are no deficiencies, the report will so indicate and the public works director will recommend to the board of commissioners that said streets/roads be accepted and placed on the official Harris County Road Register.
(6)
After receipt of the successful inspection report, the subdivider/owner/developer shall forward to the board of commissioners (a) a four-year guarantee in the form of a cost bond, letter of credit, or certified check, effective for four years from the date of the successful inspection, in the amount of five percent of the cost of the road work done, to include drainage system, base, and paving, accompanied by a copy of the contractor's invoices for said road work; (b) a deed conveying said street/road and right-of-way to Harris County, Georgia; (c) a copy of the plat referenced in the right-of-way deed; (d) a document showing the map and parcel numbers of the property being deeded; and (e) a check to cover the cost of recording the deed.
(7)
In addition to any other requirements provided for herein for the acceptance of a street/road by the board of commissioners hereunder, the subdivider/owner/developer shall provide a commitment policy of owner's title insurance to the board of commissioners insuring, except for title insurance standard exceptions, the fee simple title to the street/road being accepted by the board of commissioners and dedicated to public use. Such title insurance shall be in the amount of the cost of the road to include drainage system, base and paving. The premium for the aforementioned title insurance shall be borne by the subdivider/owner/developer of the property. The requirement for title insurance shall be a pre-requisite to the acceptance of the road by the board of commissioners. Following receipt of all required documents, a resolution for acceptance regarding the streets/roads will be prepared for consideration by the board of commissioners. Following adoption of the resolution, the deed shall be recorded, and copies of the resolution and the recorded deed will be provided to the subdivider/owner/developer upon receipt of the owner's title insurance policy, which replaces the commitment policy submitted with the road acceptance documents.
(8)
Six months prior to expiration of the bond, letter of credit, or certified check, the public works director or his designee shall conduct a final inspection of said streets/roads.
(9)
After the final inspection has been accomplished, the public works director shall complete a final inspection report and forward the original to the board of commissioners and a copy to the subdivider/owner/developer. This report will indicate any deficiencies noted and what the contractor must correct/complete to bring the road into compliance with the county's standards for new road construction. If the street/road does not meet standards within 60 days, the subdivider/owner/developer's bond or letter of credit will be called in, or the cash bond utilized, to accomplish required corrections. If there are no deficiencies, the report will so indicate and at the end of the four-year guarantee period, the bond, letter of credit, or a check in the amount of the original certified check shall be returned to the subdivider/owner/developer.
(10)
In the event a subdivision is developed in two or more phases, at the beginning of street/road development in each phase, the subdivider/owner/developer must first furnish/post a surety bond, letter of credit, or certified check to the board of commissioners to guarantee existing county roads in the subdivision against damage directly attributable and caused by heavy truck traffic in the delivery of building materials and equipment in the construction of new structures within the subdivision. Said bond, letter of credit, or certified check shall be in the amount of 75 percent of the cost to pave the existing road, with each succeeding year to remain the same until the development is 90 percent completed and if any repairs are required as a result of damage by heavy equipment, the developer will be billed for 75 percent of the repair costs in the form of a report of damage along with a list of repairs which must be accomplished. If payment is not made to the county within 60 days, the subdivider/owner/developer will not be issued additional building permits for the subject subdivision until restitution is made. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider/owner/developer to notify the board of commissioners when the development is 90 percent complete, and upon verification of same by the appropriate county department, if the bond or letter of credit have not been called in, or the certified check not utilized for repairs, the bond or letter of credit, or a check in the amount of the original certified check shall be returned to the subdivider/owner/developer.

Subgrade shall be tested by a registered soils/geo technical engineer and/or by proof-rolling the entire road with a loaded truck. Compaction tests shall be taken every 500 feet or at intervals specified by the public works director or his designee, and the results of said tests shall be provided to the public works director or his designee. Prior to placing any subsequent layer of base materials, the subgrade shall have sufficient stability to support construction equipment without excessive movement regardless of compaction. Areas of subgrade that are unstable shall be remixed to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction to the satisfaction of the public works director or his designee.
(6)
A minimum of eight-inch base, 21 feet wide, constructed of DOT-approved graded aggregate base (GAB) compacted 100 percent will be installed. Compaction tests shall be taken every 500 feet or at intervals specified by the public works director or his designee, and the results of said tests shall be provided to the public works director or his designee. Base is to be primed. Prime may be omitted if paving can be done within 24 hours and the base is moist.

In order to obtain such waiver the subdivider/owner/developer must make written application to the department of community development and submit a detailed engineered drawing and plat reflecting the proposed street/road and the reduced right-of-way clearing requested. The application, engineering plans and plats shall be submitted to the director of public works, the county engineer and the director of the water department for review and comment.
(c)
The board of commissioners shall base its decision for a waiver for reduced right-of-way clearance on the following factors: (a) the comments and recommendations of the director of public works, the county engineer and the director of the water department; (b) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall be adequate to accommodate vehicular traffic, utilities and shall not constitute a safety hazard to vehicular traffic and the traveling public using the street/road or impede the flow of traffic thereon; (c) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall not have an adverse effect upon utility installation or maintenance and repair; (d) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall not interfere with, or restrict or impede the access to or the use of the road by Harris County vehicles (such as solid waste, law enforcement, water department, emergency fire and ambulance or road maintenance) or school buses; (e) all lots or parcels of land in the subdivision served by for the proposed road with reduced right-of-way clearance shall be no less than three acres each which may not be subsequently divided into smaller parcels; (f) the proposed road with reduced right-of-way clearance shall have curbs and gutters; (g) the purpose of the reduced right-of-way clearance shall be for aesthetic, topographical, geological or environmental reasons and shall not be an effort by the subdivider/owner/developer to reduce subdivision or road development costs.
(d)
Upon satisfaction of the foregoing and approval by the board of commissioners, an subdivider/owner/developer may in the sole discretion of the board of commissioners be granted a waiver and may construct the proposed street/road with reduced right-of-way clearance. As a condition for such waiver the subdivider/owner/developer must post, in addition to any other bonds or obligations required, a five-year road maintenance bond, double the amount of the development costs of the road to provide for road repair in the event the road must be repaired because of tree roots or any other causes arising from the non-clearance of the entire width of the right-of-way.
(e)
The right-of-way for which a waiver for reduced clearance is granted must be deeded to, accepted by and dedicated by Harris County for public use in accordance with Harris County ordinances. Any waiver for reduced clearance granted hereunder shall be subject to the right of Harris County Board of Commissioners to clear the right-of-way, in whole or in part and at its cost, at any time, if in its sole discretion, further clearance is deemed necessary.
(Ord. No. 05-06, § 1, 12-19-2006)

DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS, ROADS AND EASEMENTS EXISTING PRIOR TO OCTOBER 5, 2004[5]

Footnotes:
--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 3-92, §§ I—III, adopted Nov. 17, 1992, pertained to a procedure for acceptance of streets and roads existing prior to Nov. 17, 1992, but did not specify manner of codification; hence, inclusion herein as Div. 2, §§ 4-121—4-123, was at the discretion of the editor. In the event that conflict should arise between these provisions and §§ 4-111—4-114, it is presumed that the more recent provisions will prevail.

Sec. 4-121. - Standards; classification; county funds allocation; construction limitation, repair and maintenance; cost distribution.
(a)
This division does not require that the county accept any street, road or easement, hereafter referred to as "road", but authorizes acceptance upon request by the property owners and compliance with acceptance criteria as outlined in this document.
(b)
Roads eligible for acceptance under this division are those roads which were in existence in unincorporated Harris County before the effective date of this division and open to the general public, and comply with acceptance criteria as outlined in this document.
(c)
The responsibility for initiating the request for acceptance of any road rests upon the property owners. A separate request must be submitted for each road.
(d)
Written requests for road acceptance will be received by the county manager at any time; however, the annual cut-off date for submittal is February 1 for those roads to be considered for adoption in the next fiscal year (July 1 to June 30).
(e)
Following annual consideration of requests under this program, acceptance or denial of roads by the board of commissioners will be based upon:
(1)
The amount of county funds available to be allocated in the next fiscal year budget for this purpose;
(2)
Compliance with acceptance criteria as outlined in paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this section;
(3)
Whether the road lay-out and/or design would impose an inherent hazardous or dangerous condition for public usage;
(4)
Road criteria to include physical condition of the road, road surface, roadbed, drainage, existing right-of-way, available space for additional right-of-way, any correctable engineering design defects which could affect safe traffic conditions, the number of homes served, and estimated expense to bring the road up to minimum standards under this program;
(5)
Agreement of a minimum of 80 percent of property owners to donate right-of-way to the county and acknowledgment by the property owners that they will be required to pay certain assessed costs as outlined in paragraph (i) of this section.
(f)
To qualify for road acceptance, the road must serve a minimum of two homes and five lots already platted and recorded as of the date of October 5, 2004.
(g)
To qualify for road acceptance, a minimum right-of-way of 60 feet must be provided to Harris County to allow adequate space for the roadbed, shoulders on either side of the roadbed, drainage ditches and structures, and space for installation and maintenance of public service utilities. If layout of the road and the homes thereon prevent a right-of-way of 60 feet, the board of commissioners shall have the authority, however, to waive the requirement of 60 feet.
(h)
To qualify for road acceptance, the road must abut a county or state road.
(i)
Prior to acceptance of street/road, a minimum of 80 percent of the property owners must be in agreement and willing to furnish the required right-of-way, and to pay all costs associated with transfer of the right-of-way to the county. The remaining 20 percent of the property owners who do not agree to donate the right-of-way may be subject to condemnation procedures for right-of-way acquisition, at the discretion of the board of commissioners. Following acceptance and repair of street/road by the county, property owners will be billed according to a pro rata share of the total road assessment, which is comprised of the total cost for the right-of-way survey work, title/deed work, and driveway pipe for the street. The total road assessment is to be based upon the front footage of each property, for one-third of the appropriate road assessment annually, for a period of three years. If the total assessment is paid the first year, the property owner may deduct ten percent. The board may also establish additional charges for late payment and assess any cost incurred in collecting delinquent assessments and may compel compliance with reasonable rules and regulations for the provision of road acceptance and improvement. The aforementioned costs shall be collected by the tax commissioner of the county or such other official as the board shall designate. If full payment is not remitted after three years, owner's property abutting the subject road will be subject to enforcement as for delinquent property tax by issuance of fi. fas. or executions for said assessments in the same manner and with the same lien dignity and priority as fi. fas. and executions are issued for state and county taxes. Property owners must be willing to pay for any driveway pipe, if needed, before pipe is installed.
(j)
Roads accepted under this program will be categorized as "Class D" roads, and will receive minimum maintenance only.
(k)
When a road has been accepted for maintenance under this program, the county government will perform all repair and/or maintenance and absorb all costs for the work involved in connection with same, excluding costs for driveway pipes.
(l)
When a road has been accepted as a part of the county road system, and initial repair has been completed, then it will be eligible for county maintenance as appropriate to the class, to include (a) vegetation control within right-of-way, (b) litter control within right-of-way, (c) drainage structures and ditch maintenance, (d) shoulder stabilization and maintenance, and (e) appropriate surface maintenance.
