The property shall be in the proper zone as required by the Harris County Zoning Ordinance prior to approval of the preliminary plat.
2.
The subdivider shall submit to the Harris County Health Department a detailed soils survey by a registered professional soils scientist, or other qualified individuals acceptable to the health department, fifteen (15) days prior to preliminary plat review by the Harris County Planning [Commission.]
3.
The subdivider shall then comply with the procedure set forth in articles VII and XVI and comply with design standards and required improvements as set forth in these regulations.
The purpose of the preapplication review is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans, and no fees are charged for this review.
