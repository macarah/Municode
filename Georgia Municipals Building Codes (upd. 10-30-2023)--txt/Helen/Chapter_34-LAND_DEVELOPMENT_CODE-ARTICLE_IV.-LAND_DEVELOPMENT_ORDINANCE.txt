Subdivision IV. - Sewer System Interceptors[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 06-08-01, adopted September 19, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former subdiv. IV, §§ 34-671—34-673, and adding a new subdiv. IV. Former subdiv. IV pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 05-01-04, adopted February 15, 2003.

Sec. 34-671. - Purpose.
Excessive amounts of fats, oils and grease, grit, sand and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer and treatment systems, causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation facilities. This article sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system. The objectives of this article are to minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system.

Sec. 34-673. - Sand and oil/grease traps.
(a)
Requirement for.
(1)
All users involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall provide oil/grease traps. Grease traps shall be designed as appropriate for the size of the facility as specified in subsection (b), below. Additionally, any user who generates a wastewater which contains greater than the quantity of oil and grease than 100 mg/L, and provided that the excess oil and grease is floatable and can be effectively removed in an oil/grease trap, then said user will be required to install an oil/grease trap.
(2)
All users whose wastewater stream is associated with unusually large quantities of grit, sand or gravel shall be required to install a sand trap. All car/truck wash systems shall be required to install a sand trap; design specifications and calculations must be submitted and approved by the city before installation.
(3)
No originator may cause or permit any F.O.G. to bypass or avoid the oil/grease trap.
(4)
The requirements of this ordinance section shall not apply to private living quarters or dwelling units.
(b)
Design criteria.
(1)
For restaurants and other eating establishments.
a.
Required except as provided in c. below. All oil/grease traps used in conjunction with restaurants or other eating establishments shall be a minimum of 1500 gallons and shall have a total volume size to be such to allow one change of contents per 24 hour period. All oil/grease traps must be designed in accordance with Department of Human Resources Public Health, Chapter 290-5-26 Section 12, Grease Traps.

Required except as provided in c. below. All existing in ground oil/grease traps, for existing eating establishments, must have a filter system installed on the discharge side of the trap.
c.
Under the counter oil/grease traps are determined to constitute a high risk of failure to prevent F.O.G. from contaminating the public sewer system and are not recommended, and specifically discouraged. However, due to various circumstances existing within the city, all existing and anticipated originators may not be able to provide an in ground oil/grease trap, and therefore, under the counter oil/grease traps will be permitted as hereinafter provided in this subdivision. All such under the counter oil/grease traps must be designed so that they prevent water flow if the trap is filled to capacity and, when filled to capacity the water flow will back up unless the trap is cleaned out.

(1)
Class I food establishments - $300.00; class II, III, and IV food establishments - $100.00; and sand traps - $100.00.
(2)
Every user shall fully complete an application for permit as provided by the city and developed by the city manager.

(2)
The street improvements shall have been completed and in place for a period of one year and, upon inspection following such period of time, shall be found to be free from defective workmanship or material and free from sinkholes or other settling.

The bond will guarantee to the city that the street has been installed in a workmanlike manner, that such street is free from defects caused by faulty material or workmanship, and that the street will remain in acceptable condition for a period of at least one year. The guaranty bond shall be effective for a period of one year. If, before the end of the one-year period, the street is found to have settled or be otherwise unacceptable because of faulty workmanship or material, the defective street shall be repaired at the cost of the developer up to the amount of the guaranty bond, and upon failure or refusal to do so within 90 days after demand is made by the city commission, the city shall make such repairs as are reasonably necessary and recover the cost thereof.
