O.
The method of deciding the low bidder for towing services will be determined by taking quantities of vehicles towed within the previous 12 months, as provided by the City of Marietta, multiplied by the bidder's unit prices. The evaluation will also consider, in addition to the lowest overall price, service records and public complaints against the towing firms and responsiveness determinations as contained in Section 3-6-050 of the Marietta City Code. In addition, the city reserves the right to award the towing contract in the best interest of the city and to accept or reject any and all bids and to waive technicalities and informalities in the bids.
