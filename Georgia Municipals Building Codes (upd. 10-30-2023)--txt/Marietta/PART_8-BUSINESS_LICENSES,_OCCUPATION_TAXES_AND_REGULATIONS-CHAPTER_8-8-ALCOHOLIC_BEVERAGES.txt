A processing fee of $100.00 for each such alcoholic beverage license sought to be transferred shall be paid in addition to the new general business license fees.

D.
Upon the sale or other transfer of any interest in the business for which the license was issued, the purchaser or transferee of such interest shall be entitled to continue to operate such business for a period of no more than 60 days, pending the issuance of a new license, but only if such purchaser or transferee has filed an application with the city as required in Subsection A. In case of the death of any natural person holding a city business license, or any interest therein, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor of the lawful heir or devisee of the deceased person by filing a new application with the city for the change in license ownership within 75 days of such death. The business involved may continue to operate until disposition of the application as determined as for an original licensee. No additional fees or business taxes shall be charged above what would be due if the business, or portion thereof, remained under the deceased person's ownership.
