The Board of Lights and Water ("BLW" and hereafter referred to as same) is authorized to build, maintain and operate a water system, sewer system, electrical system, cable television system, telecommunications system and any other utility system. For this purpose, the BLW shall have all powers now provided the BLW by general state law or the Marietta City Charter and all powers formerly vested in the city council for these purposes; provided, all official actions of the BLW shall become effective only upon approval of the appropriate minutes of the BLW meeting by the city council.
(Code 1978, § 6-1001; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
6-4-020 - Utility charges; payment.
All charges for utility services as established by the BLW rendered within and outside the boundaries of the city shall be due and payable as provided in the policies, rules and regulations of the BLW. Failure to receive notice of the amount due shall in no way relieve the customer from making payment as therein provided. Should any customer receiving municipal utility service fail to pay any sums finally determined due, such service may be discontinued until such sums together with all penalties are paid in full; provided that nondelinquent tenants must be provided with such services as individuals upon proper application and payment for installation of meters. Any person who receives benefit of utility services which remain unpaid, and subsequently applies for new service, may be denied service until such unpaid account is paid in full, or the BLW may add such unpaid balance to said new account pursuant to its policies, rules and regulations.

6-4-030 - Same—Notice of lien.
If default occurs in the payment of such sums as may be due by a customer who is either the owner of the property served or the agent of such owner, then at least ten days prior to obtaining said lien, written notice shall be given to the owner of such property so served, as shown on the latest available ad valorem tax digest of the county, that the property so served is subject to a lien for such utility charges in the nature of a tax lien for special assessments, the amount due as of the date of the notice, and that the lien will be for that amount plus all amounts coming due thereafter and interest and costs.
(Code 1978, § 6-1003; Ord. No. 3427, 10/11/78, § 2; Ord. No. 5339, 8/10/94; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
6-4-040 - Same—Executions authorized.
Should a customer who is either the owner of property served or the agent of such owner not pay the utility charges thereon, and the payment thereof shall be in default for a period of 60 days after the first date due, the BLW shall be entitled and authorized to have an execution issue, which execution shall issue in the name of the BLW in rem against the property described and shown on the ad valorem tax digest, and in personam against the owner of the property and shall be for the principal amount due, as of the date of the issuance of the lien plus all amounts coming due thereafter, plus interest at the rate of one percent per month from the first date due, respectively, and the sum of $1.50 cost for the issuance of the execution, and the actual costs of recording said lien. For the purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one month. Subsequent costs thereon shall be the same as those now or hereafter allowed by law to the sheriff for the performance of similar services. Such execution for utility charges shall be delivered to the police chief of said city, and subsequent proceedings had thereon shall be as provided by law for the enforcement of executions for taxes. All executions issued pursuant hereto, shall issue against the owner and the property served, and shall be recorded on the general execution docket in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia and the same shall constitute a lien against the property from the time the charge was first due, which lien shall rank on a parity with and be of equal dignity to other liens for special tax assessments.

CHAPTER 6-20 - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL

6-20-010 - Findings and purpose.
The City of Marietta finds it necessary and desirable, for the protection of the public health and welfare, to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections (a cross connection being defined as a physical connection between two otherwise separate piping systems or vessels one of which contains potable water and the other does not). The city finds that the optimum control may be accomplished by isolating potential sources of contaminants or pollutants on the customer's premises and protecting the public supply at the point of delivery to the customer's premises. The provisions of this cross connection control ordinance are applicable to any system to which water is supplied by the public distribution system including sprinkler and fire protection systems and residential systems.
(Code 1978, § 5-5001; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
6-20-020 - Introduction of substances and cross connections.
It is illegal to introduce any substance into any potable water system or to have any unprotected cross connections with the city's potable water supply, except for those substances or connections required by the city for treatment of water or the receipt of treated water, and except for cross connections protected as hereinafter provided.
(Code 1978, § 5-5002; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
6-20-030 - Enforcement.
A.
The Board of Lights and Water through its utility division is responsible for enforcing those provisions hereof which protect the public water supply system through the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage of contaminants or pollutants. This responsibility extends to new construction as well as to existing customers and situations.
B.
The building inspection division is responsible for enforcing the provisions hereof which amend the city building code to prevent backflow or backsiphonage on the customer's premises into the potable water piping system. This responsibility extends to both new and existing customers.
C.
All water customers shall at least annually examine all their cross connection devices to insure they comply with this chapter and any future amendments thereto, and shall maintain such devices to insure they comply with this chapter and any future amendments thereto, and shall report on such devices as hereinafter required. The customer has the dual responsibility for protecting the water in his own system from degradation due to conditions originating on his premises, and for protecting the public water distribution system from contamination due to backsiphonage or backflow of contaminants and pollutants from the customer's water system. The customer is liable to the city and BLW for any cost incurred by the city or BLW in curing any health hazard and for clean up costs due to backflow from unprotected cross connections on his premises. When a backflow preventer is required at the service connection, the customer is responsible for the costs of procurement, installation, and maintenance.
