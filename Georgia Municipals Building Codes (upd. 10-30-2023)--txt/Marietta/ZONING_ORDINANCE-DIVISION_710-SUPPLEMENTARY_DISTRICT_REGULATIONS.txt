710.01 - Zoning review requirements for single-family homes.
In order to determine compliance with zoning regulations, all building permit applications for any new single-family home on a lot of record shall be accompanied by either:
A.
A site plan stamped by a registered surveyor or engineer that must include the footprint of all existing and proposed structures; or
B.
An accurately scaled sketch of the property, including the footprint of all existing and proposed structures and their distance from surrounding property lines. All sketches must be accompanied by a subdivision plat or tax plat. If no plat is available, then a site plan as identified in Subsection A. of this section must be provided.
The Director of the Department of Development Services may require submission of a site plan certified by a surveyor or engineer if a submitted sketch does not allow a definitive judgment to be made in regards to zoning conformity. If approved, the site plan or sketch along with the subdivision plat or tax plat will be filed with the building permit. The Director of the Department of Public Works may require additional information regarding storm water management, floodplain, erosion control and other matters.

Buffers, as required by this article, shall be established and maintained by the property owner to separate and partially screen noise and views. Buffers shall meet the following requirements:
A.
Property owners and developers shall leave undisturbed the natural topography and growth of the land, except vegetation determined to be:
1.
Dead or diseased*;
2.
Natural growth where too dense for normal growth*;
3.
Trees that are a danger to property or people*;
4.
Poison ivy and other noxious vegetation;
5.
Creeping vines and invasive species that threaten the viability of desirable plant growth (e.g. kudzu).
*
Determinations must be certified by a registered arborist or licensed landscape architect for trees in these categories to be removed.
The Planning and Zoning Director or his/her designee may require additional landscape improvements in buffers that lack sufficient topography or foliage to provide for visual screening and diffusion of sound. These improvements may include natural features that supplement the existing landscape such as trees, berms, shrubs, flowers, grass, stone, rocks, and other landscaping materials.
B.
Buffers must not be used for parking or contain any structure other than a permanent wall or fence as required by the city.
Vehicular access, public utilities, and stormwater drainage are allowed in a buffer provided they are crossing perpendicularly to the buffer. Such facilities shall be designed so as to cause the least amount of intrusion possible. Stormwater retention and detention facilities shall not be placed in a required buffer. Bike paths and greenways are excluded from these restrictions.
C.
The Planning and Zoning Director may provide an administrative variance of up to 20% of a required buffer for clearing when used as a slope easement. The Planning and Zoning Director shall determine the minimum area necessary for said easement and the replanting schedule to be followed upon completion of the improvements.
D.
Buffers shall consist of a permanent wall or solid fence not less than 6 feet in height and a screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide for visual screening and diffusion of sound. The Planning and Zoning Director may provide an administrative variance to allow a buffer to be established without the fence, when it can be demonstrated that the existing or proposed landscape serves a satisfactory screening function and the adjacent affected property owner consents to the issuance of said variance. The Planning and Zoning Director shall not provide an administrative variance when it has been approved as a stipulation of zoning. All required fencing shall be installed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. See Section 712.08 (Tree Protection and Landscaping) for a listing of additional requirements pertaining to species and location requirements.
E.
Any grading, improvements or construction adjacent thereto shall be conducted far enough from the buffer area so as not to disturb or encroach upon the buffer area.
F.
Buffer area shall be counted in addition to the setback requirement.
G.
Buffers need not be established in those instances in which a street separates zoning districts.
H.
No buffer shall be required in circumstances in which the rezoning of a parcel or parcels of property creates a condition in which a buffer would be required along the boundary of an adjacent property or properties, where no buffer had previously been required. Where a buffer was previously required on adjacent property before the rezoning, and the size of that buffer would be increased due to the rezoning, the previously required buffer shall remain the same size.
