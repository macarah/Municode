ARTICLE 4-4-30 - SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICY

4-4-30-010 - Safety policy.
It is the policy of the city/BLW that every employee is entitled to work under the safest possible conditions in the various positions of the city. To this end, every reasonable effort will be made to provide and maintain a safe and healthy workplace, safe equipment, proper materials to work with and to establish and enforce safe work methods and practices at all times.
(Code 1978, § 4-1211; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
4-4-30-020 - On-the-job injuries.
A.
The purpose of this section is to provide city/BLW employees with fair and equitable workers' compensation benefits as defined under the State of Georgia Workers' Compensation Act.
B.
This policy applies to all employees on city/BLW payroll and excludes all contracted services.
C.
Responsibilities.
1.
Employee. When injured or ill due to an on-the-job incident, notify his supervisor of the injury or illness immediately, to keep their supervisor informed of required absences and to follow the instructions of the treating physician.
2.
Supervisor. To provide proper safety training and supervision of job skills so that accidents may not occur and to ensure that injured or ill employees that are involved in on-the-job accidents receive proper medical or first aid treatment as soon as possible.
3.
Department Heads or Their Designee. To make authorization and/or approvals for treatment of injured or ill employees; ensure proper follow-up of accident investigations; ensure that absences of the employee are properly excused; and that the proper payment is made to the employee, if any, under any leave policy while absent due to an on-the-job injury or illness. The department head will ensure that the human resources department is informed within 24 hours of any on-the-job injury or illness or by 5:00 p.m. on Monday following an incident occurring over the previous weekend and of any absence of the employee due to such injury or illness.
4.
Human Resources Department. This department will coordinate and administer the city/BLW workers' compensation program and fund.
D.
Treatment of Injured Employees.
1.
A supervisor or department head may administer minor first aid treatment for scratches, minor cuts or scrapes only.
2.
Injuries or illnesses requiring physician treatment:
a.
All occupational injuries or illnesses which require physician treatment are to be referred to one of the physicians or physician groups listed on the workers' compensation approved panel of physicians that are posted on all employee bulletin boards. Department heads or their designee will issue an authorization to treat the employee to give to the designated physician. A copy of such authorization will be sent to the human resources department. If none of the posted physicians or physician groups are available, the employee is to be treated at the nearest urgent care facility (such as Wellstar, etc.) or if necessary, the nearest hospital emergency room.
b.
All emergency on-the-job accident victims shall be transported to the emergency room of a licensed hospital. Supervisors must have approval from their department head to personally transport or delegate an employee to transport job-related injured or ill employees to the hospital emergency room. In cases of severe injuries or illnesses, the supervisor or their designee will immediately call 911 for immediate treatment and transport to the hospital. However, as soon as possible after the employee is transported to the hospital, the supervisor should notify his department head.
c.
The human resources department will be responsible for review of bills received for treatment, and submitted to the city's workers' compensation administrator for approval and payment. The city will only be responsible for those medical expenses authorized by the department head, the department of human resources or medical emergency treatment at a licensed hospital or urgent care facility for job-related injuries or illnesses. If a claim for workers' compensation benefits is subsequently denied due to fraud, violation of safety rules, or other legitimate reasons, incurred expenses may be the responsibility of the employee.
d.
Employees injured on the job have the right to a one-time change of their initial treating physician to another physician on the workers' compensation panel. Employees shall inform the human resources department in writing of any change in treating physicians.
e.
Prescription drugs/medical supplies authorized for treatment of on-the-job injuries. Employees may choose between the following options for filling prescribed drugs and obtaining medical supplies.
(1)
The employee may go to one of the pharmacies or medical supply businesses that the city/BLW has arranged to be invoiced for workers' compensation-related charges. The employee will need to show the pharmacist an authorization to invoice the city/BLW that is on the bottom of the "authorization to treat" form as well as proper identification that the person to whom the pharmacist is giving the prescription drugs to is the injured employee or their authorized representative. Only the prescription drugs and medical supplies authorized by the treating physician shall be charged and paid for by the city/BLW.
(2)
The employee may pay for the prescription drugs and/or medical supplies and submit receipts indicating the prescription number, issuing pharmacy, prescribing physician, date filled, and price to the human resources department for reimbursement.
E.
Required Reports.
1.
The employee, or if unavailable, the appropriate supervisor must report all occupational injuries, accidents and illnesses to the department head or his designee by the end of the workday in which an accident, injury or illness occurs. After normal working hours or on weekends, a report must be filed with the department head or his designee by 12:00 noon the following workday. The city/BLW may consider as invalid any on-the-job injury/accident that has not been reported using the required "first report of injury" form and within the above time limits. A "first report of injury" form will be used to report all job-related accidents, injuries or illnesses regardless of the nature or severity.
2.
It is the employee's responsibility to make sure that the "first report of injury" form states exactly what happened and a clear indication of the type and severity of the injury or illness. If the supervisor or department head disagrees with the employee's explanation, he should so indicate in an attachment memorandum to the "first report of injury" form and provide explanatory detail. However, the report should be submitted to the human resources department with the employee's account of the accident/incident intact.
3.
Employees are responsible for obtaining excused absence slips from their treating physicians and to provide them to their department head or his designee on a timely basis so that the workers' compensation insurance payments may be promptly processed. The excuse should include an estimated time that will be required to be absent from duty. If light duty is authorized, the physician should include specific restrictions in order to properly assign duties without further injury. If excuses for absences due to on-the-job injury are not received (except for hospital admissions due to on-the-job injuries), then the city/BLW's absenteeism policy will be enforced.
4.
Employees are also responsible for obtaining authorization to return to work from their treating physician.
5.
The department head should review and discuss the accident and subsequent injury or illness with the appropriate supervisor to develop safety precautions to help ensure that similar accidents, if preventable, do not recur.
6.
The department head must file the "first report of injury" form with the human resources department within two eight-hour workdays after the accident, injury or illness occurred or by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday following an incident that occurred over the immediately preceding weekend (including accidents involving employees assigned to shifts). The department head shall notify the human resources department when an employee returns to work after being off due to an on-the-job injury or illness.
7.
The human resources director and/or risk manager shall consult with the workers' compensation administrator's assigned attorneys on all legal matters regarding liabilities of the city/BLW in relation to workers' compensation.
F.
Temporary Assignments.
1.
Occasionally, an employee who has suffered an on-the-job injury is cleared to return to work with restrictions but is able to perform other productive duties in his department. Department heads should make every effort to return employees to work in some productive capacity from on-the-job injuries as soon as possible. However, if light duty work or appropriate duties within the skill level and physical capability of the employee is not available within their department, the department head should consult with the human resources department for placement of the light duty employee in another department on a temporary basis. If there is still no light duty available, the employee may remain off duty on workers' compensation benefits until he/she is able to return to work without restrictions.
2.
Employees on light duty work due to an on-the-job injury shall be paid the same rate of pay worked on their regular job. This provision does not apply to any period of partial loss of earnings due to an injury for which a permanent award is paid under the Workers' Compensation Act since such award is intended to compensate the employee for loss of all earnings during the stated period. Any temporary light duty work assignment provided as an accommodation to an on-the-job injury will not constitute working out of the employee's classification for purposes of Section 4-4-28-120.
G.
Employee Compensation.
1.
Medical bills: If an employee is injured on the job or becomes ill due to an on-the-job condition or exposure, the employee is eligible for treatment as provided under the State of Georgia Workers' Compensation Act, as amended.
2.
Salary or wage, first 90 days of lost time due to the approved injury: The employee shall be paid regular straight pay up to 90 calendar days, or 67 eight-hour workdays (536 hours) or for fire personnel 751 hours, unless the claim for workers' compensation benefits is controverted by the city/BLW or by the city/BLW's workers' compensation administrator. For approved claims, no deduction will be made from any leave balance credited to the employee. However, the employee is required to endorse the workers' compensation check to the city/BLW. The intent is to provide the employee's normal base salary or wage for the first 90 calendar days of lost time due to the injury, but not any amount greater than the employee would earn if they were working their normal base workweek.
3.
Salary or wage, after the first 90 days of lost time injury: If the employee remains unable to return to work due to his on-the-job injury or illness after the first 90 days of absence, or 67 eight-hour workdays (536 hours) or for fire personnel 751 hours, the employee may choose one of the following options:
a.
Receive full salary from accrued leave balances and endorse the workers' compensation check to the city/BLW; or
b.
Receive the workers' compensation check and receive partial salary from leave balances; or
c.
Accept the workers' compensation check as total compensation. If the workers' compensation check is accepted as total compensation, no time will be deducted from any leave balance while the employee remains unable to return to work due to an on-the-job injury or illness.
d.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the discretion of the city manager, in consultation with the human resources director, the following option may also be made available to an eligible employee under qualifying circumstances: Continuation of salary or wage payments for up to an additional 90 days, or 67 eight-hour workdays (536 hours) or for fire personnel 751 hours, as provided in Section 4-4-30-020G(2) above.
(i)
For purposes of this discretionary option, "qualifying circumstances" means circumstances [A] that are beyond the employee's control and were not unreasonably caused or contributed to by the employee, [B] that have precluded the employee from being able to return to work due to his/her on-the-job injury or illness, and [C] that would result in substantial harm or prejudice to the employee if the relief authorized herein were not provided.
(ii)
Where this option is initially determined to be available to an employee, it will be provided in one-third (e.g., 30-day) increments, to enable the city/BLW to make any reasonable inquiries necessary and appropriate to ensure the continued existence of qualifying circumstances. An initial determination that this option is available shall create no enforceable expectation, contractual right, or property interest in the continuation of the option.
4.
Accruals. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4-4-16-090A, all leave balances and benefits will continue to accrue to the employee while absent due to on-the-job injury or illness.
H.
Coordination with FMLA Leave. Workers' compensation does not establish an independent basis for leave of absence. Therefore, when an on-the-job injury or illness requires an employee to be absent from work and to receive inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider, it constitutes a serious personal health condition within the meaning of the city/BLW's FMLA policy. See Section 4-4-16-090A(1)(c), (2). Accordingly, where the employee otherwise meets all eligibility requirements, his/her absence shall be designated as FMLA leave; provided, however, that for any period of time during which an employee is receiving workers' compensation benefits while on FMLA leave, the requirement that he/she first use any accrued vacation, sick, holiday or compensatory leave for all or any part of the 12-week FMLA leave period shall not apply.
(Code 1978, § 4-1212; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 20; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 8211 , 1/13/2021, §§ 1, 2)
4-4-30-030 - Weapons policy.
A.
Purpose and Intent. The city/BLW's employees are its most valuable resource and, for that reason, their health and safety is of paramount concern. As such, the purpose and intent of this policy are to promote safe and secure working environments for all city/BLW employees.
B.
Weapon Defined. For purposes of this policy, the term "weapon" means the following: any explosive compounds (including fireworks); firearms (including those designed to fire or expel bullets, pellets, BBs, paintballs, arrows, darts, or other projectiles); Tasers or other electrical stunning devices; knives (with blades longer than three inches); pepper spray, mace, or other noxious chemicals or substances designed to incapacitate; any club, baton, metal or plastic knuckles, or other bludgeon; and any other instrument, device, or item designed, modified, or adapted for use primarily as a weapon. The term "weapon" also includes any of the foregoing instruments, devices, or items that are non-functional, unloaded, or imitation (excluding obvious toys). The term "weapon" does not include any tool provided or approved for an employee's use by the city/BLW; provided, however, that the use or threatened use of any such tool (or any other instrument, device, or item not referenced above or not normally regarded as a weapon) as a weapon shall be considered to be a violation of this policy.
C.
Scope. This policy shall apply to all city/BLW employees other than sworn or unsworn employees of the police department or employees who otherwise work under the supervision of the chief of police. The chief of police shall implement a standard operating procedure regulating and determining the possession, carrying, and transportation of firearms and other weapons by sworn and unsworn employees of the police department or who otherwise work under his or her supervision, in accordance and consistent with state and federal law.
D.
Prohibited Conduct; Exception.
1.
No employee of the city/BLW shall carry, possess, or transport a weapon inside any city/BLW government building, on the grounds of any city/BLW property (including parking lots or parking facilities as provided below), or in a city/BLW government vehicle, while on duty or otherwise acting in the course of his or her employment.
2.
No employee of the city/BLW, whether on duty or off duty or whether or not acting in the course of his or her employment, shall carry, possess, or transport a weapon inside any city/BLW government vehicle.
3.
No employee of the city/BLW who is off duty or otherwise not acting in the course of his or her employment shall wear any uniform, shirt, jacket, hat, or other visible article of clothing or other item that identifies him or her as an employee of the city/BLW while carrying, possessing, or transporting a weapon. The purpose of this latter prohibition is to prevent misunderstandings or confusion among members of the general public as to the identity, position, authority, duties, or responsibilities of an off-duty employee of the city/BLW and to make clear that such an employee is not carrying, possessing, or transporting the weapon in the course of his or her employment.
4.
Limited exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of this policy for any city/BLW employee to possess a weapon in his or her personal vehicle in a parking lot or parking facility owned or operated by the city/BLW, provided each of the following requirements is met:
a.
The weapon is secured in a locked compartment or locked rack of the employee's personal vehicle or in a locked container in the vehicle; and
b.
The parking lot or parking facility (or the portion thereof in which the employee's vehicle is parked) is unsecured and available to the general public. For purposes of this provision, the term "unsecured" means not controlled by a security station, security officer, or similar means which limit public access to such parking lot or parking facility.
To the extent that this limited exception applies, it shall not be a violation of this policy for an employee to carry a weapon on his or her person or otherwise have a weapon in his or her control while in his or her personal vehicle and entering or exiting the parking lot or parking facility; provided that, if the weapon is one for which state law requires a license, said employee holds such license.
E.
Exemptions. In his or her sole discretion, the city manager shall be authorized to grant a temporary or limited exemption to an employee, in writing, upon a showing of good cause or other appropriate circumstances.
F.
Construction. This policy shall be construed and applied in a manner fully consistent with the United States Constitution, the Constitution of the State of Georgia, and HB 60 (2014).
