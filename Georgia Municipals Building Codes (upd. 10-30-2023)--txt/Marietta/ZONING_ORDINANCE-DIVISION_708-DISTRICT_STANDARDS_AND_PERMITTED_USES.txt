708.09 - PRD (SF), Planned Residential Development.
A.
Purpose and Intent. The PRD (SF) district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and other public benefits. Buildings must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PRD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments which enhance the surrounding area.

708.14 - PRD (MF), Planned Residential Development (multifamily).
A.
Purpose and Intent. The PRD (MF) district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and provide other public benefits. Buildings must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PRD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments which enhance the surrounding area.

708.19 - PCD, Planned Commercial Development.
A.
Purpose and Intent. The PCD district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements for business and commercial developments under a unified plan so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and reduce traffic congestion.

All commercial building facades visible from a public street must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PCD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in industrial development patterns that conserve and recreate open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide quality developments which enhance the surrounding area.
B.
Permitted Uses. This district is designed to allow business/office parks and other commercial developments which are designed under a unified plan. The planned development should incorporate features such as coordinated transportation and parking networks, building design parameters and holistic landscaping themes.

708.28 - PID, Planned Industrial Development.
A.
Purpose and Intent. The PID district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements for industrial development under a unified plan so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which create campus-like environments, foster natural resource conservation and reduce traffic congestion. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and other public benefits. All commercial and industrial building facades that are visible from a public street must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PID district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in industrial development patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide quality developments which enhance the surrounding area.
B.
Permitted Uses. This district is designed to allow industrial parks which are developed under a unified plan. The planned development should incorporate features such as coordinated transportation and parking networks, building design parameters and holistic landscaping themes.
C.
Temporary/Conditional Uses Allowed by the Director.
1.
Mobile retail food establishments shall be allowed on property zoned PID according to the restrictions listed below:
a)
Written permission of the property owner is obtained.
b)
Such use does not last longer than 3 days consecutively and 12 days annually.
c)

d)
If property is within 50 feet of a residentially zoned parcel, measured property line to property line, then food truck operations shall cease at 9:00 p.m.
e)
Adequate paved parking, ingress and egress are provided on site.
f)
A temporary use permit is applied for and approved by the Director of the Department of Development Services.
g)
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not issue and are not granted the authority to issue variances to any of the regulations relating to mobile retail establishments; all such variance requests must be submitted to City Council. Variances for mobile food establishments shall be considered according to the criteria defined under Section 712.01 E.
