T.
Explanations. If a motion has been voted on without discussion and a council member feels that it is necessary to explain his/her vote, he or she may have up to five minutes to give the public reasons for his/her vote.

Whenever possible, the city will pay directly in advance any airfares, hotel fees or registration fees. All refunds are to be delivered to the finance department.

Within five working days of returning from any such travel, all persons shall submit an itemized travel expense statement to the finance department. Actual invoices for hotels, registration fees and airline tickets shall be included if they were not prepaid by the city. Receipts for meals, taxis, parking, tips, etc., are not required as such expenses are deemed to be covered by the per diem set by the council.
D.
An immediate settlement will be made between the person traveling and the finance department for the balance of expenses overpaid or underpaid by the city.
E.
Failure to comply with any of the above procedures may result in the withholding of any salaries or allowances otherwise due the person until a satisfactory accounting of the travel expense is made.
F.
Travel expense of spouses or others is expressly ineligible. Only the single room rate will be reimbursed if the spouse or other ineligible persons travel with the employee. However, if the hotel only has double room rates, then such rate is otherwise reimbursable. In the event conditions merit, this rule may be waived by council.

The city or board of lights and water, in general, will reimburse only necessary and reasonable travel expenses. Exorbitant rates charged by luxury hotels, for example, may not be fully reimbursed if other accommodations were available. Only the tourist class airfare will be reimbursed. First class fares will be allowed only if they were the only available seats on that flight.
H.
At any time, the city council or board of lights and water may require that persons traveling on city or board business, do so at their own expense, with no travel advances. Persons traveling would thus submit all receipts on the travel expense statement for approval by the city manager.
