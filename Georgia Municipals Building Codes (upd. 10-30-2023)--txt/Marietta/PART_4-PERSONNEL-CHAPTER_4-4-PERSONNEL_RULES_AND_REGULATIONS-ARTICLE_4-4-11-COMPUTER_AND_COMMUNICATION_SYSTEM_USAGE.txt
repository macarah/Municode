ARTICLE 4-4-11 - COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USAGE

4-4-11-010 - Internet and electronic mail acceptable use policy.
A.
General Principles. This statement sets forth the policy of the City of Marietta (city) and Marietta Board of Lights and Water (BLW) with regard to access to and disclosure of electronic mail (e-mail), technology solutions/collaboration tools and other electronic records sent or received by employees, utilizing city/BLW-provided technology and internet technology.
Internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools and e-mail services are provided by the city/BLW to support open communications and exchange of information and the opportunity for collaborative government-related work. The city/BLW encourages the use of electronic communications by its agencies and employees. Although access to information and information technology is essential to the missions of government agencies and their users, use of internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and e-mail services is a revocable privilege. Conformance with acceptable use, as expressed in this policy statement is required. Departments of the city/BLW are expected to maintain and enforce this policy.
Internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and e-mail communications to and from city/BLW employees are presumed to be work-related. City/BLW computers and any data stored in them are the property of the city/BLW and may be accessed at any time by authorized officials of the city/BLW. Employees shall not expect privacy in the use of city/BLW computers. The city/BLW may, without notice, monitor internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and/or e-mail to ensure it is being used only for business purposes.
At a minimum, users of internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and e-mail services provided by the city/BLW are expected to:
1.
Inform themselves of this acceptable use policy and acceptable and unacceptable uses on the internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and with e-mail used both internally to the city/BLW and externally to the world at large. The burden of responsibility is on the user to abide by the acceptable and unacceptable uses, or prior to use, inquire about uses not cited. Compliance with applicable acceptance use restrictions is mandatory.
2.
Use city/BLW-provided internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and e-mail services for city/BLW government-related activities and not for personal business.
3.
Abide by the legal protection provided by copyright and license to programs and data.
4.
Know and follow the generally accepted etiquette of the internet. For example, use civil forms of communication when using e-mail, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and/or the internet.
5.
Avoid uses of the network e-mail, technology solutions/collaboration tools, blogging, and/or the internet that reflect poorly on their department or on the city/BLW. Statements on e-mail, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and/or the internet should reflect the same language used in the presence of a department head or the city manager. City/BLW Conflict of Interest Code and other existing and evolving rules, regulations, and guidelines on ethical behavior of government employees and the appropriate use of government resources apply to the use of electronic communications systems supplied by the city/BLW.
6.
Make each electronic communication truthful and accurate.

Use by Contractors. Contractors and other non-city/BLW employees may be granted access to city/BLW-provided internet services at the discretion of the city manager or their designee. Acceptable use by contractors and other non-city/BLW employees working for the city/BLW is the responsibility of the city/BLW contract administrator. The city/BLW contract administrator is expected to provide contractors who use city/BLW internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and/or e-mail services with this policy.
3.
Passwords and User Access Controls. Use passwords associated with a city/BLW information system only on that system. When setting up an account at a different information system that will be accessed using the internet, choose a password that is different from ones used on city/BLW information systems. Do not use the same password for both local and remote internet-accessed systems. If the password used at the remote, internet-accessed remote site were to be compromised, the different password used locally would still be secure. Passwords should not be so obvious so that others could easily guess them, and user access controls shall be determined by the director of information technology based on industry accepted best practices.
4.
Logoff (Exiting). Always make a reasonable attempt to complete the logoff or other termination procedure when finished using a remote, internet-accessed system or resource. This will help prevent potential breaches of security.
5.
E-mail and Technology Solutions/Collaboration Tools Security. Unencrypted electronic mail and digital messages sent or received outside any department and on the internet cannot be expected to be secure.
6.
Disclaimers. Users shall avoid being drawn into discussions where disclaimers like "this represents my personal opinion and not that of my department of the city/BLW" need to be used. When you are using internet, technology solutions/collaboration tools, and or e-mail services provided by the city/BLW, users shall remember that they are representing the city/BLW and shall act accordingly.
7.
Retention. Only essential e-mail and/or instant messages shall be saved. It is the responsibility of the security officer or their designee, in conformance with the city's retention policy, to establish retention criteria in compliance with federal and state law for essential e-mail and other electronic records within his/her department.
8.
Open Records Act. All public departments are subject to the Open Records Act. All records, including computer-based or generated information fall under this Act. Therefore, users of the city/BLW information systems should treat computer-based information as they would written communications. All information on the city/BLW computer system is confidential. Such information may not be shared with other users internally or externally except through the procedures outlined in the Georgia Open Records Act. Department heads will be responsible for determining what information is appropriate for dissemination via e-mail, instant messaging, and other forms of electronic dissemination.
9.
Permanence. Users shall exercise the same care in drafting e-mail and digital records and communications that would be applied to any other written communication. E-mail is more permanent than paper communications. Anything said in e-mail and digital records may be discovered by an opponent in litigation.
10.
Enforcement. All provisions of this policy are deemed rules of the city/BLW and violation of any could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination under the City Code (Section 4-4-20-040).
E.
Procedures. The department head, or their delegated representative is responsible for their employees' compliance with the provisions of this policy and for investigating noncompliance. When an instance of noncompliance with this policy is discovered or suspected, the agency shall proceed in accord with departmental and city/BLW personnel policies. Complaints about inappropriate or offensive e-mail, digital records, and/or other forms of electronic communication should be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor. Such reports shall be taken seriously by the supervisor and carefully investigated. Suspension of service to users may occur when deemed necessary to maintain the operation and integrity of the city/BLW network. User accounts and network access may be withdrawn without notice if a user violates the acceptable use policy. Disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment may be imposed depending on the severity of the violation. Criminal or civil action against users may be initiated when laws are violated.

4-4-11-020 - Use of licensed software.
In compliance with federal copyright laws, the city/BLW will not participate in or condone the illegal duplication of licensed software and/or digital media. Such activity is strictly prohibited on city/BLW premises and/or machinery. The city/BLW does not own the copyright to any software or its related documentation and, unless authorized by the software developer, does not have the right to reproduce it for use on more than one computer.

A.
Purpose. This document is designed to provide the city/BLW minimum security policies for protection of city/BLW assets inclusive of information, computers and networks.
B.
Information Custodianship. Information, such as data, electronic mail, documents and software, are city/BLW assets. Information technology systems include any device (i) procured or maintained by city/BLW staff; and (ii) used to interact, store, or access City of Marietta data or electronic services. This includes, but is not limited to, computers, mobile devices, phones, access key pads or cards, radios, etc. By placing information on city/BLW information technology systems, employees grant the city/BLW the right to edit, delete, copy, republish, and/or distribute such information. The city/BLW at all times retains the right to access, search, and monitor all directories, electronic mail messages, instant messages, voice mail messages, internet sites visited by employees, chat groups and newsgroups, material downloaded or uploaded by users of the internet, or any other electronic or telephonic transmissions contained in or used in conjunction with the city/BLW's computer, electronic mail, instant messaging, and voice systems and equipment with no prior notice. This right applies both during employees' employment by the city/BLW and after its cessation for any reason or no reason, including whether the cessation was voluntary or involuntary. In determining the value of an asset, consideration shall be given not only to the sensitivity of the information, but also to the consequences of unauthorized disclosure, modification, destruction, or unavailability of the information. The value of these assets will determine the level of controls needed to provide adequate safeguards, backup and access controls. However, ownership, custodial responsibility and rights to these assets are herein established.

State and Federal Access, Privacy and Confidentiality Laws. All information, regardless of the medium in which it is maintained or communicated, is subject to pertinent state and federal laws governing access, the protection of privacy and prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure.
7.
Access Categories—Classification of Information. Information classification provides a means for separating information into categories with different protective requirements. The city/BLW determines, in advance, the extent to which information shall be disclosed to specified users. Determinations shall be made based on the nature of the information and the duties of city/BLW employees. The following general categories of information serve to provide guidance in identifying appropriate users or recipients:
a.
"Public information" is information accessible under Freedom of Information Law and the Georgia Open Records Act and is available to any person, notwithstanding one's status or interest within the limitations as provided in those laws.
b.
"Restricted information" pertains to information that is not public information but can be disclosed to or used by city/BLW representatives to carry out their duties, so long as there is no legal bar to disclosure.
c.
"Confidential information" including protected health information (PHI) and Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is information that is protected by law. Access to confidential information is prohibited unless permitted by an exception in law.
C.
Physical Access Security. The department head shall put into place appropriate safeguards to limit physical access to any information technology systems.
