Employees are to notify their department head or his designee of any illness covered by this policy and expected period of absence not later than one hour after their normal scheduled starting time for work. This procedure shall be followed for each day the employee is unable to work, unless prior approval is given by the department head or his designee.

2.
In addition, department heads may also require a medical certificate signed by a licensed physician for the following reasons:
a.
Any period of absence consisting of three or more consecutive work days or for periods greater than 36 hours for fire personnel on a 24-hour shift.

Such time shall be deducted from the employee's sick leave balance. The base period for calculation of this benefit shall be from the second Sunday in November of the previous year to the second Saturday in November of the year in which the benefit is paid. Incomplete or partial completion of the base period voids this benefit. The base period shall include no part of the initial six months of employment.
I.
Exhausted Sick Leave. No sick leave in excess of that accumulated may be granted.

2.
Purpose and Intent.
a.
Employees who report to work with a contagious condition or with contagious symptoms and/or circumstances, as those terms are defined herein, pose a risk to the health and safety of other employees and/or the public. This, in turn, may significantly impact city operations, including the safe and effective delivery of critical city/BLW services, through compromised job performance, diminished productivity, inadequate staffing, or other adverse working conditions.
b.
In accordance with the relevant guidance and recommendations published by public health agencies, it is the purpose and intent of this section, when in effect, to regulate and impose reasonable restrictions on employees in reporting to work with a contagious condition or with contagious symptoms and/or circumstances, as those terms are defined herein.
c.
In addition, it is the purpose and intent of this section and the expectation of the city/BLW that employees will remain informed regarding the public health emergency and will take recommended precautions to reduce the risk of contracting and/or transmitting a contagious condition, as defined, such as receiving optional but recommended flu vaccinations, as well as covering nose or mouth when coughing or sneezing, washing or sanitizing hands, and consistently applying sanitizers in common work areas and equipment.
3.
Definitions. When in effect, this section shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the following definitions:
a.
Contagious Condition. As used herein, the term, "contagious condition" refers to a medical condition caused by or directly associated with COVID-19/coronavirus, SARS, swine flu, H1N1, tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis, mononucleosis, mumps, measles, rubella, chicken pox, and the like, which can be transmitted to others, either by direct physical contact with persons with the condition or by indirect contact (e.g., through objects touched by or secretions from such persons or through airborne transmission from such persons' coughing, sneezing, etc.).
b.
Contagious Symptoms. As used herein, the phrase, "contagious symptoms" refers to symptoms identified or recognized by a public health agency as indicative of a contagious condition. Depending on the contagious condition, such symptoms may include influenza-related symptoms, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches.
c.
Contagious Symptoms and/or Circumstances. As used herein, the phrase, "contagious symptoms and/or circumstances" refers to the following situations:
(i)
When an employee exhibits or experiences contagious symptoms or has been placed under a quarantine related to the contagious condition by a healthcare provider or at the direction of a public health agency; and/or
(ii)
When an employee has had significant or prolonged exposure to, or has been in physical contact with, a family member, household member, or other person:
[1]
Who has been diagnosed with a contagious condition; or
[2]
Who has been placed under a quarantine related to the contagious condition by a qualified healthcare provider or at the direction of a public health agency; and/or
(iii)
When an employee and/or a family member, household member, or other person with whom the employee has had significant or prolonged exposure to, or has been in physical contact with, exhibits contagious symptoms; and/or
(iv)
When an employee and/or a family member, household member, or other person with whom the employee has had significant or prolonged exposure to, or has been in physical contact with, has recently traveled to a geographic area or participated in any other activity identified by a public health agency as presenting a heightened risk of exposure to a contagious condition (such as travel to an area for which the CDC has issued a Level 2 or 3 travel advisory or time spent on a cruise ship).
Employees with any questions as to whether a given situation meets the above-stated definition of "contagious symptoms and/or circumstances" should contact human resources for further guidance.
d.
Incubation Period. As used herein, the term, "incubation period" refers to the period of time, as determined by public health agencies, between:
(i)
When a person is exposed to a pathogen known or believed to cause a contagious condition; and
(ii)
When contagious symptoms would be expected to begin to appear.
As a general rule, persons who do not experience such symptoms at the conclusion of the incubation period are considered to be no longer at risk for having the contagious condition.
e.
Quarantine. As used herein, the term, "quarantine" refers to a period of time during which a person who was exposed to a pathogen known or believed by public health agencies to cause a contagious condition remains physically separated from other persons to minimize the potential for further exposure. The incubation period for the contagious condition normally determines the duration of the quarantine.
f.
Public Health Agency. As used herein, the term, "public health agency" refers to the CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Georgia Department of Public Health (and its health districts and affiliated county health departments).

f.
Any employee not reporting to the workplace in accordance with this section should notify the city/BLW in the same manner as required by Section 4-4-16-050(E) of the sick leave policy.
5.
Absence Due to Contagious Condition or Due to Contagious Symptoms and/or Circumstances.
a.
An employee who is absent from work in accordance with this section may be required to work remotely, whether from home or from another location. The decision whether to require an employee to work remotely will be made by the director of human resources, in consultation with the department head, and will depend upon consideration of various relevant factors, including the employee's position, the nature of his/her duties and responsibilities, logistical and other practical considerations, and the precise reason for the absence.
b.
An employee who is absent from work in accordance with this section who is not required to work remotely may be eligible to be compensated for any (non-overtime) hours they would normally have been scheduled to work during the absence for a period not to exceed 14 days.
(i)
Such paid administrative leave will be authorized when the employee submits medical documentation from a healthcare provider or a public health agency confirming that the absence is due to a contagious condition or due to contagious symptoms and/or circumstances as defined herein.

Exemptions from standby status will be determined by the director of human resources and risk management, in consultation with the department head, based primarily on consideration of the precise reason for the absence.
(iv)
An employee who is deemed to be ineligible for paid administrative leave under this section will be required to use accrued sick leave, annual leave, or comp time to cover the absence from work. If accrued leave is unavailable or exhausted, the employee may be recorded as absent with approved unpaid leave.
c.
If the event that an employee's absence under this section extends beyond 14 calendar days, the employee will be required to provide additional medical documentation supporting the extended absence. If the employee is unable to obtain such medical documentation, the case will be reviewed by the director of human resources and risk management and the city manager. Ultimately, the city will handle any extended absences in compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations, including the ADA and the FMLA, as well as the city's personnel rules and regulations.
6.
Amendments. Due to the unprecedented nature of the public health emergency precipitating adoption of this section, the ongoing availability of new information, the difficulty in predicting relevant developments, and the need to act more quickly than the local legislative process allows under even ideal circumstances, the mayor, upon consultation with the city manager, the city attorney, and/or the director of human resources, is hereby authorized to make immediate amendments to this section consistent with its stated intent and/or changes implemented by the federal or state governments. Any such amendments made to this section by the mayor shall remain in full force and effect until the next scheduled or called meeting of the city council, at which time said amendments may be ratified, vacated, or modified.

This section shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including the ADA and the FMLA, as well as the city's personnel rules and regulations. If any aspect of this section is determined to be inconsistent or in conflict with any subsequently enacted or promulgated federal or state law, rule, or regulation, the latter shall control to the extent of said inconsistency or conflict.
b.
This section is for the city's internal, administrative use only and is not intended and should not be construed or applied as creating a higher duty of care than presently exists under applicable law. Nor does this section create any enforceable rights, entitlements, promises, or expectations or otherwise operate to enlarge the potential civil liability of the city or any city official, officer, or employee in any way.

The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change, or abolish the provisions of this section, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority.
In accordance with these laws, the city/BLW will not discriminate against any employee or job applicant in initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment on the basis of their membership, application for membership, performance of military service, application for service, or obligation to the uniformed service.
A.
Eligibility. Any regular employee who is a member of a uniformed service, or any current employee who is drafted or joins a uniformed service may be granted a leave of absence for the purpose of service, including travel to and from same.

No advance notice is required if the notice is precluded by military necessity or the giving of notice is impossible or unreasonable.
C.
Health Benefits. All full-time employees on military leave are entitled to continue their health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) for up to 24 months. The city/BLW can charge the employee 102 percent of the full premium for this coverage if the military leave exceeds 31 calendar days. If the leave is 31 calendar days or less, the employee can continue to pay the employee portion of the premium and the city/BLW will continue to pay the employer portion until the end of the 31st calendar day.
Employees who do not elect to continue coverage during military leave will have their coverage reinstated upon reemployment without any exclusions or waiting periods except to the extent the exclusion would have applied even if coverage had not been terminated as a result of such service. However, some exclusions or waiting periods could apply to medical problems or conditions that the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs determines to be the result of a service-connected disability.
D.
Pension Benefits.
1.
Supplemental Pension. The city/BLW will retroactively contribute to the account of returning employees, an amount that would have been contributed had the employee not left for military duty. Allocations will not include earnings or forfeitures.
2.
Regular Pension. Time spent in the uniformed service will be credited to all employees toward meeting length of service requirements for eligibility for participating in a retirement plan, for vesting in the retirement plan or in the calculation of benefits under the retirement plan. The city/BLW will suspend pension contributions during uniformed service because the employee is not in pay status. However, upon such employee's return, the city/BLW will retroactively contribute an amount that would have been contributed had the employee not left for duty. Earnings for pension purposes will be computed at the hourly or salary rate at which it would have been earned if the employee were not on leave. The break in service provision of the retirement plans shall not affect an employee on military leave.
E.
Reemployment. Employees on a leave of absence for uniformed service or training have varying time limits within which to report to work or apply for reemployment after service has ended, depending on the length of the period of service or training. For service of 30 days or less, employees must notify the city/BLW verbally or in writing of their intent to return to a position of employment no later than the first regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day after the service plus eight hours to return home. For service from 31 to 180 days, an application for reemployment must be filed within 14 days after completion of the service. For service for 181 days or more, an application for reemployment must be submitted not later than 90 days after completion of the service. All of these deadlines can be extended for up to two years if the individual is hospitalized or convalescing from a service-connected injury or illness. Such discharge from service must not be disqualifying and the employee must be physically and mentally capable of performing the essential functions of the work involved in his previous or similar position with or without a reasonable accommodation. An examination by an individual or entity appointed by the city BLW at city/BLW expense will be utilized to aid in determining fitness for duty and/or the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation. An "application for reemployment" is defined as an employee notifying the department of human resources verbally or in writing that he or she is returning from duty and seeks reemployment. For any period of service that exceeds 30 days, employees must also submit acceptable documentation that establishes a timely reemployment application, shows that the employee has not exceeded the five-year total time limit on the duration of service, and shows that the employee's separation or discharge from service was not disqualifying. Examples of acceptable documentation include the Department of Defense Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty), military orders carrying an endorsement indicating completion of required service, or copies of payroll documents showing periods of service.
The city/BLW is not required to reinstate returning employees under the following conditions:
1.
The city/BLW's circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable;
2.
The employment from which the person leaves to serve in the uniformed services is for a brief, nonrecurring period and there is no reasonable expectation that such employment will continue indefinitely or for a significant period;
3.
The returning employee is no longer qualified (i.e., no longer has the ability to perform the essential functions of the position) despite the city/BLW's reasonable efforts to requalify such individual (including retraining) and reemployment would cause the city/BLW undue hardship;
4.
The returning employee was not released from service under honorable conditions (see 38 U.S.C. Section 4304). Note: Reemployment rights are restored upon upgrade of discharge to service under honorable conditions.
F.
Reemployment Rights. All regular employees on military leave will retain a right to reemployment for up to five years of cumulative service, with exceptions listed in 38 U.S.C. Section 4312.
1.
An employee who is called to active service for less than 90 days is entitled to:
a.
Reemployment in the position in which the employee would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the city/BLW had not been interrupted by such service, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or
b.
Reemployment in the position in which the employee was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, but only if the employee is not qualified to perform the duties of the position referred to above after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to qualify the employee.
2.
An employee who is called to active service for more than 90 days is entitled to:
a.
Reemployment in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the city/BLW had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status or pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or
b.
Reemployment in the position in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform, only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of a position referred to above after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to qualify the person.
3.
In the case of a person who has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during such service, and who, after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to accommodate the disability, is not qualified due to such disability to be employed in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed, the employee is entitled to:
a.
Reemployment in any other position which is equivalent in seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform or would become qualified to perform with reasonable efforts by the city/BLW; or
b.
Reemployment in a position which is the nearest approximation to a position referred to above in terms of seniority, status and pay consistent with circumstances of such person's case.
4.
The employee will not be penalized for having been on duty and shall be entitled to the seniority and other rights and benefits determined by seniority that the employee had on the date of the commencement of service in the uniformed services plus the additional seniority and rights and benefits that such person would have attained if the person had remained continuously employed. The returning employee shall also be entitled to any increase in base salary accorded his position, excluding performance increases, which would normally be accorded to the incumbent in the position.
5.
Reemployment will not be dependent upon the laying off of another person who was hired at an earlier date than the date of the person returning from military leave in the same or similar position.
6.
The city/BLW will make reasonable efforts to refresh or update the skills of the returning employees from military leave by providing refresher training and any training the employee would have received if he or she would have remained on the job.
G.
Paid Leaves of Absence.
1.
All employees are entitled to leave of absence without loss of pay, leave benefits, or service time on all days which they are engaged in ordered military duty up to a maximum of 18 working days in any one federal fiscal year (October 1—September 30). A shift of 12 hours or less constitutes one workday for the purposes of this policy. For fire personnel who work a 24-hour shift, a maximum of nine shifts or 216 hours will be allowable for paid military leave during any one federal fiscal year. In the event the governor declares an emergency and orders any employee to ordered military duty as a member of the National Guard, any such employee, while performing such duty, shall be paid his salary or other compensation as an employee for a period not exceeding 30 days in any one federal fiscal year (October 1—September 30).
2.
Leaves of absence exceeding 18 working days (or 216 hours for fire personnel) in any one federal fiscal year shall be granted for assignment to duty functions of a military character, without pay, but not less in service time. For National Guard members who are ordered by the governor to perform military duty for a declared emergency, leaves of absence exceeding 30 working days (or 360 hours for fire personnel) in any one federal fiscal year shall be granted, without pay, but not less in service time.
3.
Employees will be paid the difference between their city salary and their military basic pay for any or all periods of absence while engaged in the performance of ordered military duty after expiration of the payment periods provided for in paragraphs 1. and 2. Employees must submit proof of military pay to the director of human resources and risk management to justify payment.

Employees called to court for the purposes of this policy shall promptly notify their immediate supervisor so that arrangements can be made for their absence from work. The employee will be paid his regular pay provided he submits evidence of the actual days spent in court. Monies received or which could be received for said service from any court (except actual receipted expense) shall be endorsed to the city/BLW. Only the number of actual days or hours spent in court will be considered in granting leave and the employee must return to duty promptly when released by the court.

4-4-16-090 - Family and medical leave of absence without pay.
The provisions of this section are regulated by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-3) and pertinent Department of Labor regulations as they may be promulgated. The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change or abolish the provisions of this section, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority.
A.
Eligibility and Reasons Granted. The provisions of this section apply only to those employees who have been employed for at least 12 months (such 12 months of employment does not have to be consecutive) and who have provided at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12 months before any leave is requested. In determining the hours worked, paid leave, such as vacation, sick or compensatory leave is not included.
The city manager or a department head will grant up to a total of 12 workweeks of Family and Medical Leave Act (hereinafter FMLA) leave to any eligible employee during any 12-month period for one or more of the reasons listed below. The 12-month period for purposes of this section shall be measured forward from the beginning date of an employee's first approved FMLA leave. Employees are required to first use any accrued vacation, sick, holiday or compensatory leave for all or any part of this 12-week period. When an employee uses paid leave in lieu of unpaid FMLA leave, the city/BLW will only provide sufficient unpaid leave to total 12 workweeks in the designated 12-month period of time in accordance with FMLA regulations.
1.
Reasons.
a.
Birth of a child and to care for that child if requested within one year after birth of the child. Employees are required to give at least 30 days notice for a request for this reason and specify the amount of time requested. If, due to unforeseeable circumstances, some adjustment must be made to the requested leave, employees are required to provide the city/BLW with reasonable notice of such adjustment. Failure to comply with this notice requirement may be grounds for postponement of the requested leave.
b.
Placement for adoption or foster care of a child if requested within one year after placement of the child. Employees are required to give at least 30 days notice for a request for this reason and specify the amount of time requested. If, due to unforeseeable circumstances, notice is not able to be given within the 30-day time period, employees are required to provide reasonable notice within two business days of learning of the need for leave. Failure to comply with this notice requirement may be grounds for postponement of the requested leave.
c.
Serious personal health condition making the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his job. Employees are required to give notice as soon as practicable after the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee, and specify the amount of time requested.
d.
Care for a parent, spouse, or child with a serious health condition. A qualifying child must be under 18 years of age, or if older, incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability. Employees are required to give notice as soon as practicable after the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee, and specify the amount of time requested. For purposes of this policy, a parent includes only a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a child. Parents-in-law are not included. For purposes of this policy, child includes biological children, adopted children, foster children, step children, legal wards or a child of an employee standing in loco parentis and the child is either under age 18 or age 18 or older and incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability. For purposes of this policy, spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized under state law for purposes of marriage in the state where the employee resides, including common law marriage in states where it is recognized. Domestic partners are not eligible for the provisions of this section. Leave for care of any other relatives or for any other individuals who may be a part of an employee's household is not authorized by this section.
e.
Military Family Leave: The National Authorization Act for FY 2008 amended the FMLA to provide eligible employees working for the city/BLW additional leave rights related to military service.
(1)
Eligible employees are entitles to up to 12 weeks of leave because of "any qualifying exigency" arising out of the fact that the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of contingency operation.
(2)
An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the service member. The military caregiver leave is available during "a single 12-month period" during which an eligible employee is entitled to combined total of 26 weeks of all types of FMLA leave.
2.
For the purposes of this section, a serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves one of the following:
a.
Hospital Care. Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with, or as a consequence of, such inpatient care. Incapacity for the purposes of FMLA is defined to mean inability to work, attend schools, or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment for it, or recovery from it.
b.
Absence Plus Treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition) that also involves:
(1)
Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, a nurse, or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider or by a provider of health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or
(2)
Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.
c.
Due to Pregnancy, or for Prenatal Care. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.
d.
Chronic Conditions Requiring Treatments. A chronic condition that:
(1)
Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider or a nurse or physician's assistant under the direct supervision of a health care provider;
(2)
Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and
(3)
May cause episodic incapacity rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)
e.
Permanent/Long-Term Conditions Requiring Supervision. A period of incapacity that is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of but need not be receiving active treatment from a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.
f.
Multiple Treatments (Non-chronic Conditions). Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery from them) by a health care provider or a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury or for a condition that would be likely to result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, etc., severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney disease (dialysis).
Employees must give 30 days notice for all requests for leaves of absence for any planned medical treatment. If the employee fails to give 30 days notice, when requested, for foreseeable leave, with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the city manager or department head may deny the taking of FMLA leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the city manager or department head of the need for FMLA leave.
All requests for FMLA leave for the serious medical condition of the employee, spouse, parent or child must be substantiated by a health care provider's certification of the existence of such medical condition. The initial certification must be provided within 15 days after the city/BLW requests such certification. The city/BLW'S request for certification shall be written and addressed to the employee.
The employee is required to provide his department head on the beginning day of the sixth and twelfth week of FMLA leave, a recertification by the health care provider of the status of the employee's, spouse's, parent's or child's serious medical condition, and a written statement by the employee as to his intention to return to work. If the employee's FMLA leave is intermittent or a reduced schedule of work, the employee shall provide the required recertification and written statement of intent at such time as the employee's accumulated FMLA leave totals six weeks and 12 weeks.
Intermittent leave or a reduced schedule of work may be taken whenever medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work. Employees needing intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt the department's operations. Intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule will not be approved for birth of a child, placement for adoption or foster care of a child. The city/BLW reserves the right to temporarily transfer an employee on intermittent leave or a reduced schedule of work to an alternative position, with equivalent pay and benefits, that better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position.
3.
If a husband and wife are employed by the city/BLW, they are limited to a combined total of 12 work weeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for the following reasons only:
a.
Birth of a child, and to care for the newborn child; or
b.
Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care.
B.
Employee Benefits During Leave.
1.
Health Insurance. The city/BLW will provide and pay for the same group health care coverage during the FMLA leave in the same manner as for active employees. The city/BLW will notify the employee on FMLA to pay the employee portion of any health insurance premium owed to the city/BLW during his absence. If the employee elects not to return to work after the FMLA leave, the city/BLW will initiate proceedings to collect the city/BLW's portion of the premium paid during the leave of absence. The city/BLW will not collect such premiums if the employee fails to return to work after the FMLA leave due to a continuation, recurrence or onset of the medical condition or other circumstances affecting the employee or other family members which are clearly beyond the employee's control.
2.
Life Insurance. The employee may elect to continue coverage of the city/BLW's life insurance benefit. The employee is responsible for timely payment of all premiums, including the city/BLW's portion, during his absence. The employee is responsible for timely payment of all premiums for any supplemental policies the employee wishes to continue. Failure to pay the monthly premiums within 30 days of the due date will result in termination of the coverage.
3.
Vacation and Sick Leave. No vacation or sick leave will be earned by an employee on leave of absence without pay status.
4.
Pension Plans. No contributions will be made to the employee's supplemental pension fund while on leave without pay status. However, credit for service time for the employee's regular pension plan will be credited to an employee while on leave without pay status for family and medical leave purposes only.
5.
Performance Evaluations, Performance Awards and Longevity Bonuses. Any leave of absence without pay for four or more work weeks will result in a corresponding adjustment of evaluation date and, if eligible, the effective date of award of any eligible performance raise or bonus or longevity bonus will also be adjusted.
C.
Return to Work. An employee is expected to return to work no later than the first work day of the week following the expiration of the FMLA leave for the above reasons. Failure to do so for any reason will constitute abandonment of city/BLW employment by the employee.
Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee will be restored to his original job, or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions.
If the employee's absence is due to personal illness, the employee may return to work at any time upon providing a fitness for duty certification by his health care provider. Employees who desire to return to work prior to the end of their leave must give the city/BLW notice as soon as possible, but no later than two work days prior to their return.
If an employee who requests leave under this section is identified as a key employee (a salaried employee who is compensated among the highest ten percent of all city/BLW employees at the time of the request) when he requests such leave, then such employee may be denied restoration to his employment with the city/BLW under the following conditions:
1.
The restoration of the employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the city/BLW;
2.
The city manager or department head gives written notice to the employee of his status as a "key" employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take FMLA leave, and informs the employee of the potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the city/BLW determines that substantial and grievous economic injury to the city/BLW's operations will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave;
3.
The city manager or department head gives the employee written notice as soon as a decision is made to deny job restoration and explains the reasons for the decision;
4.
The city manager or department head offers the employee a reasonable opportunity to return to work from FMLA leave after giving notice; and
5.
The city manager or department head makes a final determination as to whether reinstatement will be denied at the end of the FMLA leave period if the employee then requests restoration.
D.
Procedure.
1.
Employee's Responsibilities. The employee requesting family/medical leave should complete a request form as provided by the human resources department. Such request form should be submitted to the employee's department head and forwarded to the human resources department. The employee should meet with a human resources department staff member to explain the circumstances of the leave and for the personnel staff member to explain the employee's rights and obligations under this Act. The employee is also responsible for providing all information required on the form, notice of absence when required and for all certifications by any treating health care provider. An employee must work cooperatively with supervisors and department managers to work out a treatment schedule which best suits the needs of both the city/BLW and the employee.
2.
Department Responsibilities. The department head is required to approve leave as outlined in this section for eligible employees. Department heads or supervisors are prohibited from discriminating against employees who take family and medical leave in employment decisions such as performance evaluations, promotions or disciplinary actions. Department and division managers are required to maintain the departmental and/or division poster notifying employees of the provisions of the FMLA. If an employee verbally notifies a supervisor, division manager or department head of the need for leave which may be eligible under this policy, such supervisor should inquire further of the employee of the need to have more information about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and to obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken.
3.
Human Resources Department. The human resources department will serve as advisor to employees and supervisors on the requirements of eligibility for family/medical leave and the provisions of the FMLA. All records pertaining to family and medical leave will be maintained in the employee's confidential medical file in the custody of the human resources department. The human resources department will be responsible for notification of any premiums due from the employee and the collection of same.
(Code 1978, § 4-1099; Ord. No. 5198, 8/11/93; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, § 7; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, §§ 1, 7; Ord. No. 7545, 7/13/2011, § 3)
4-4-16-100 - Leave of absence for religious holidays, education or special work.
The city manager may grant a regular full-time employee a leave of absence without pay for a period of one day up to but not to exceed 12 calendar months for reasons of celebrations of religious holidays, education or special work which will permit the city/BLW to profit by the experience gained or the work performed.
No benefits will be provided to any employee while on a leave of absence without pay for these reasons unless discontinuance and reinstatement of any such benefit is impractical due to the short length of the absence in the discretion of the human resources director.
Performance Evaluations, Performance Awards and Longevity Bonuses. Any leave of absence without pay for four or more work weeks will result in a corresponding adjustment of evaluation date and, if eligible and funded by the city/BLW, the award of any performance raise or bonus or longevity bonus.
The employee is required to keep the human resources department (payroll section) advised of his current address at all times.
An employee is expected to return to work no later than the first work day of the week following the end of the requested leave of absence. Failure to do so will constitute abandonment of city/BLW employment.
(Code 1978, § 4-1100; Ord. No. 5198, 8/11/93; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-16-110 - Disability.
A.
A department head, with the concurrence of the human resources director, shall have the right to direct any employee within such department to be examined by an individual or entity, including, but not limited to, a physician, psychologist, or any appropriate medical care provider, designated by the city/BLW at city/BLW expense to aid in determining fitness for duty and/or the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation and/or whether the employee poses a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others. Upon the discovery of a disability of any kind which, with or without a reasonable accommodation, precludes the ability to perform the essential functions of the position or results in the employee becoming a direct threat to the health and/or safety of himself or others, the employee will be allowed sick leave, pursuant to city/BLW policy, until able, by certification of the designated individual or entity, to perform the duties of his position, or if sick leave is exhausted, he may apply for a leave of absence without pay as provided under Section 4-4-16-090 of these policies and procedures. If the city/BLW concludes that the employee is not disabled, but cannot meet or satisfy the minimum fitness for duty requirements, it may take any appropriate action including, but not limited to termination of employment as provided under Section 4-4-8-040.
B.
It is the policy of the city/BLW to make all employment decisions without regard to any disability status unless required as a bona fide job qualification.
(Code 1978, § 4-1043; Ord. No. 5139, 3/10/93; Ord. No. 5362, 10/12/94; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
