Sec. 18-48. - Tax class by SIC code and business description.
The following table contains two-digit SIC codes with the associated business descriptions. The columns to the right list the tax class for each SIC code for varying numbers of tax classes. From Table 4-A3 in appendix 4-A, we determined break points and made these assignments into the tax classes. This table is an index. Before using it, a local government must decide how many tax classes it wishes to use. Then, using the appropriate SIC code for a business, government officials can determine its tax class. For example, city A decides to use six tax classes. A business tax clerk verifies that a certain business is a special trade contractor with a SIC code of 17. Locating SIC code 17 in the left-hand column, the clerk searches this row for the entry under the column headed "6." The indicated tax class for this business is tax Class 2.
