(Ord. No. 2000-002, ยง I, 10-3-2000)
Sec. 12.4. - General provisions.
12.4.1
Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure.
12.4.2
Co-location; design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following:
(a)
For towers up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three (3) providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater;
(b)
For towers greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four (4) providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater.
12.4.3
Co-location; availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator and/or governing authority (as the case may be) that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of the following:
(a)
That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area which will allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards);
(b)
That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards);
(c)
That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment (as informed by industry standards);
(d)
That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna, and such interference cannot be effectively remedied;
(e)
That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing substantially exceed the cost and requirements of new tower development and are otherwise entirely unreasonable;
(f)
That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable, other than economic reasons.
12.4.4
Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article.
(a)
Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(b)
At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be concealed from public view by using landscaping and materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(c)
For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive.
(d)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from the sunset to sunrise.
(e)
No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within Liberty County.
(f)
To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing authority or by any state or federal law or agency.
(g)
Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land so as to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
(h)
Such other additional requirements as the administrator and/or governing authority (as the case may be) shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
12.4.5
Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers:
(a)
Towers shall be setback a minimum distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower unless the owner of the adjoining property whose property is within said fall zone otherwise consents in writing.
(b)
Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements.
(c)
Towers shall not be located closer than five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet from any existing tower; provided, however, that the administrator or governing authority may waive this requirement when it is determined that the placement of another tower within said five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet is technologically required or visually preferable. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers.
12.4.6
Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative.
12.4.7
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers:
(a)
Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and eight (8) feet in height at planting and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
(b)
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
(c)
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article.
Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to this section unless specifically required by the governing authority by virtue of other provisions of the zoning ordinance of Liberty County, Georgia.
12.4.8
Maintenance impact. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible.
12.4.9
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee, owner or the lessee of the tower and/or antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and/or antenna and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided by section 5-84 et seq. of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures.
12.4.10
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have fifteen (15) days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within fifteen (15) days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in section 5-84 et seq. of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures. Prior to the removal of any tower, the administrator may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period.
12.4.11
Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of an ownership interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the administrator of the transaction in writing within thirty (30) days.
