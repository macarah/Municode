(d)
Effect upon existing land uses.

Properties located within the overlay district will retain all of the rights conferred by their existing zoning classifications.
(3)
Nothing in this section shall preclude a property owner from petitioning the (regulating jurisdiction) for an amendment, modification or variance to any zoning classification as otherwise allowed by the jurisdiction's zoning ordinance.
(4)
Existing properties which are redeveloped or renovated within this district shall comply if the value of said improvements made to the property within a five-year period is fifty (50) percent or more of the assessed tax value of the property.
