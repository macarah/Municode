Require that public servants engage in ethical practices which always meet minimum standards;
(4)
Encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve;

(Code 1987, § 2-23; Ord. of 4-1-2003, § 2-3)
Sec. 2-49. - Policy statement.
Any person in the employ of the county board of commissioners should:
(1)
Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to the county above loyalty to persons, party, or government department;
(2)
Uphold the Constitutional laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of Liberty County therein and never be a party to their evasion;
(3)
Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought;
(4)
Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished;
(5)
Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties;
(6)
Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty;
(7)
Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties;
(8)
Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of government duties as a means for making private profit;

Expose corruption wherever discovered;
(10)
Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

All public servants have a fiduciary duty to use county fiscal and human resources in a manner which advances the public interest, and to refrain from using county property and resources for their personal benefit; therefore, public servants are prohibited from using county property and resources for personal benefit or in any manner which violates any applicable law or policy or which is not otherwise authorized.

If the county attorney has or may have a conflict of interest in any matter before the board to the extent requiring disclosure to the board under the bar standards (such as that arising from the representation of a party whose legal position is adverse to that of the board), the county attorney shall disclose the same to the board. If the county attorney and the board determine that the county attorney's office cannot resolve the conflict in a manner which will allow the county attorney's office to perform its duties properly in the matter, then the county attorney shall be disqualified from acting in such matter.

Prior to the appointment of any member to the ethics board, public notice of the opportunity for service on the ethics board shall be made in accordance with the board's then-current practice with respect to the advertisement of board appointments generally.

It shall be the responsibility of the county attorney to render an opinion with respect to the prospective conduct of all public servants. An opinion need not be written, and may be provided directly to the requestor of such opinion. Neither a request for an opinion, nor the making of a statement concerning a potential conflict of interest made by a public servant in the course of abstaining from voting or making a motion of self-recusal, shall create a presumption or inference that a public servant actually has a personal interest in the matter about which the opinion was requested. Additionally, the ethics board shall have no power or authority to impose any penalty or sanction any public servant pursuant to this division, but such power shall be exercised exclusively by the board.

ARTICLE III. - PROCUREMENT POLICY

Sec. 2-99. - General provisions.
(a)
Generally. The county board of commissioners shall provide for a procurement system of quality and integrity; provide for the fair and equitable treatment of all persons or firms involved in purchasing by the county board of commissioners; ensure that supplies and services are procured efficiently, effectively, and at the most favorable prices available to the county board of commissioners; promote competition in contracting; and ensure that the county board of commissioner's purchasing actions are in full compliance with applicable federal standards, state, and local laws.

Applicability. This procurement policy applies to all procurement actions of the county board of commissioners as applicable for the expenditure of federal funds except as noted under "exclusions." However, nothing in this policy shall prevent the county board of commissioners from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift or bequest that is otherwise consistent with the law. When both federal and non-federal grant funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified prior to procurement so that appropriate requirements can be applied, if necessary. If it is not possible to separate the funds, federal procurement regulations shall be applied to the total project. If funds and work can be separated and work can be completed by a new contract, then regulations applicable to the source of funding may be followed.
(c)
Definition. The term "procurement," as used in this policy, includes the procuring, purchasing, leasing, or renting of:
(1)
Goods, supplies, equipment, and materials;
(2)
Construction and maintenance;
(3)
Consultant services;
(4)
Architectural and engineering (AIE) services; and
(5)
Other services.
(d)
Changes in laws and regulations. In the event an applicable law or regulation is modified or eliminated, or a new law or regulation is adopted, the revised law or regulation shall, to the extent inconsistent with these policies, automatically supersede these policies.
(e)
Public access to procurement information. Most procurement information that is not proprietary is a matter of public record and shall be available to the public to the extent provided in the Georgia Freedom of Information Act.
(Code 1987, § 2-101; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.1.0, 7-6-2010)
Sec. 2-100. - Ethics in public contracting.
(a)
Generally. The county board of commissioners hereby establishes this code of conduct regarding procurement issues and actions and shall implement a system of sanctions for violations. This code of conduct, etc., is consistent with applicable federal, state, or local law.
(b)
Conflicts of interest. No employee, officer, board member, or agent of the county board of commissioners shall participate directly or indirectly in the selection or award of any contract if a conflict of interest, either real or apparent, would be involved. This type of conflict would be when one of the persons listed below has a direct financial interest, or employment or other contractual relationship, in a firm competing for the award:
(1)
An employee, officer, board member, or agent involved in making the award;
(2)
An organization which employs or is negotiating to employ, or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment of any of the above.
(Code 1987, § 2-102; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.2.0, 7-6-2010)
Sec. 2-101. - Purchasing procedures.
(a)
Micro purchase procedures. For any purchases not exceeding $5,000.00, the county board of commissioners will use the micro purchase procedure. Under micro purchase procedures, only one quote is required, provided the quote is considered reasonable. The county board of commissioners may award micro purchases without soliciting competitive quotations if the county administrator considers the price to be reasonable (e.g., based on recent research, experience, or purchases). The county board of commissioners shall make every effort to distribute micro purchases equitably among qualified vendors.
(b)
Small purchase procedures. For any amounts above the micro purchase ceiling, but not exceeding $25,000.00, the county board of commissioners may use small purchase procedures. Under small purchase procedures, the county board of commissioners shall obtain a minimum of three quotes. To the greatest extent feasible, and to promote competition, small purchases should be distributed among qualified sources. Quotes may be obtained orally (either in person or by phone), by fax, in writing, or through e-procurement. Award shall be made to the qualified vendor that provides the best value to the county board of commissioners. If award is to be made for reasons other than lowest price, documentation shall be provided in the contract file. The county board of commissioners shall not break down requirements aggregating more than the small purchase threshold (or the micro purchase threshold) into several purchases that are less than the applicable threshold merely to:
(1)
Permit use of the small purchase procedures; or
(2)
Avoid any requirements that apply to purchases that exceed the micro purchase threshold.
(c)
Sealed bids. Sealed bidding shall be used for all contracts that exceed the small purchase threshold and that are not competitive proposals or noncompetitive proposals, as these terms are defined in this document. Sealed bidding is the method for procuring construction, supply, and non-complex service contracts that are expected to exceed $25,000.00.
(d)
Competitive proposals. Unlike sealed bidding, the competitive proposal method permits: consideration of technical factors other than price; discussion with firms making proposals concerning offers submitted; negotiation of contract price or estimated cost and other contract terms and conditions; revision of proposals before the final contractor selection; and the withdrawal of an offer at any time up until the point of award. Award is normally made on the basis of the proposal that represents the best overall value, considering price and other factors, e.g., technical expertise, past experience, quality of proposed staffing, etc., set forth in the solicitation and not solely the lowest price.
(e)
Noncompetitive proposals.
(1)
Conditions for use. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals (sole-source) may be used only when the award of a contract is not feasible using small purchase procedures, sealed bids, cooperative purchasing, or competitive proposals, and if one of the following applies:
a.
The item is available only from a single source, based on a good faith review of available sources;
b.
An emergency exists that seriously threatens the public health, welfare, or safety, or endangers property, or would otherwise cause serious injury to the citizens of the county, as may arise by reason of a flood, earthquake, epidemic, riot, equipment failure, or similar event. In such cases, there must be an immediate and serious need for supplies, services, or construction such that the need cannot be met through any of the other procurement methods, and the emergency procurement shall be limited to those supplies, services, or construction necessary simply to meet the emergency;
c.
The federal or state grantee authorizes the use of noncompetitive proposals; or
d.
After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
(2)
Justification. Each procurement that is done based on noncompetitive proposals shall be supported by a written justification for the selection of this method. The justification shall be approved in writing by the county administrator and/or board of commissioners. Poor planning or lack of planning is not justification for emergency or sole-source procurements. The justification, to be included in the procurement file, shall be provided.
(f)
Cooperative purchasing intergovernmental agreements. The county board of commissioners may enter into state and/or local cooperative or intergovernmental agreements to purchase or use common supplies, equipment, or services. The decision to use an interagency agreement instead of conducting a direct procurement shall be based on economy and efficiency. If used, the interagency agreement shall stipulate who is authorized to purchase on behalf of the participating parties and shall specify inspection, acceptance, termination, payment, and other relevant terms and conditions. The county board of commissioners may use federal or state excess and surplus property instead of purchasing new equipment and property if feasible and if it will result in a reduction of project costs.
(Code 1987, § 2-103; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.3.0, 7-6-2010)
Sec. 2-102. - Independent cost estimate (ICE).
For all purchases above the micro purchase threshold, the county board of commissioners shall prepare an independent cost estimate (ICE) prior to solicitation. The details shall be commensurate with the cost and complexity of the purchase.
(Code 1987, § 2-104; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.4.0, 7-6-2010)
Sec. 2-103. - Cost and price analysis.
The county board of commissioners shall require assurance that, before entering into a contract, the price is reasonable, in accordance with the following instructions:
(1)
Petty cash and micro purchases. No formal cost or price analysis is required. Rather, the execution of a contract by the county administrator or designee (through a purchase order or other means) shall serve as the county administrator's determination that the price obtained is reasonable, which may be based on the county administrator's or designee's prior experience or other factors.
(2)
Small purchases. A comparison with other offers shall generally be sufficient determination of the reasonableness of price and no further analysis is required. If a reasonable number of quotes is not obtained to establish reasonableness through price competition, the county administrator or designee shall document price reasonableness through other means, such as prior purchases of this nature, catalog prices, the county administrator or designee's personal knowledge at the time of purchase, comparison to the ICE, or any other reasonable basis.
(3)
Sealed bids. The presence of adequate competition should generally be sufficient to establish price reasonableness. Where sufficient bids are not received, and when the bid received is substantially more than the ICE, and where the county board of commissioners cannot reasonably determine price reasonableness, the county board of commissioners must conduct a cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, to ensure that the price paid is reasonable, and if the bid is found not to be reasonable in the opinion of the board of commissioners, the bid can be rejected.
(4)
Competitive proposals. The presence of adequate competition should generally be sufficient to establish price reasonableness. Where sufficient proposals are not received (generally three or more), the county board of commissioners must compare the selected proposer's cost estimate with the ICE. For competitive proposals where costs or prices cannot be easily compared among the firms that have submitted proposals, where there is not adequate competition, or where the proposed cost or price is substantially greater than the ICE, the county board of commissioners must conduct a cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, to ensure that the price paid is reasonable, and if the bid is found not to be reasonable in the opinion of the board of commissioners, the proposal can be rejected.
(5)
Contract modifications. A cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, shall be conducted for all contract modifications for projects that were procured through sealed bids, competitive proposals, or noncompetitive proposals, or for projects originally procured through small purchase procedures and the amount of the contract modification will result in a total contract price in excess of $100,000.00. Such modifications shall require the approval of the governing board.
(Code 1987, § 2-105; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.5.0, 7-6-2010)
Sec. 2-104. - Solicitation and advertising.
(a)
Method of solicitation.
(1)
Petty cash and micro purchases. The county board of commissioners may contact only one source if the price is considered reasonable.
(2)
Small purchases. Quotes may be solicited orally, through fax, or by any other reasonable method.
(3)
Sealed bids and competitive proposals. Solicitation must be done publicly. The county board of commissioners must use one or more following solicitation methods, provided that the method employed provides for meaningful competition:
a.
Advertising in newspapers or other print mediums of local or general circulations.
b.
Advertising in various trade journals or publications or web sites.
c.
E-procurement. The county board of commissioners may conduct its public procurements through the Internet using e-procurement systems. However, all procurements must otherwise be in compliance with 24 CFR 85.36, state and local requirements, and the county board of commissioners' procurement policy.
d.
For acquisition of professional services when a "request for proposals" is used, the commission may require prequalification of consultants or contractors. The commission may base prequalification on firms meeting the state criteria.
(4)
Request for qualifications. Solicitation must be done publicly. The county board of commissioners must use one or more following solicitation methods, provided that the method employed provides for meaningful competition:
a.
Advertising in newspapers or other print mediums of local or general circulations.
b.
Advertising in various trade journals or publications or web sites.
c.
For acquisition of professional services when a "request for qualifications" is used, the commission may require prequalification of consultants or contractors. The commission may base prequalification on firms meeting the state criteria.
(b)
Time frame. For purchases of more than $25,000.00, public notice should run not less than once each week for two consecutive weeks.
(c)
Form. Notices/advertisements should state, at a minimum, the place, date, and time that the bids or proposals are due, the solicitation number, a contact person that can provide a copy of, and information about, the solicitation, and a brief description of the needed items.
(d)
Time period for submission of bids. A minimum of 30 days shall generally be provided for preparation and submission of sealed bids and 15 days for competitive proposals. However, the county administrator may allow for a shorter period under extraordinary circumstances.
(e)
Cancellation of solicitations. The solicitation of bids or proposals may be cancelled before bids or proposals are due if, in the opinion of the county administrator, the items or services are no longer needed, or if there are errors in the solicitation process.

Sec. 2-107. - Contract administration.
The county board of commissioners shall maintain a system of contract administration designed to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with their contracts. These systems shall provide for inspection of supplies, services, or construction, as well as monitoring contractor performance, status reporting on major projects including construction contracts, and similar matters. For cost-reimbursement contracts, costs are allowable only to the extent that they are consistent with accepted cost principals. The commission may withhold ten percent of the amount requested in each request for reimbursement until of all work and products are delivered and approved by the county administrator.

Consistent with Presidential Executive Orders 11625, 12138, and 12432, and Section 3 of the Federal Act of 1968, all feasible efforts shall be made to ensure that small and minority owned businesses, women's business enterprises, and other individuals or firms located in or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the area of the county board of commissioners' project are used when possible.
