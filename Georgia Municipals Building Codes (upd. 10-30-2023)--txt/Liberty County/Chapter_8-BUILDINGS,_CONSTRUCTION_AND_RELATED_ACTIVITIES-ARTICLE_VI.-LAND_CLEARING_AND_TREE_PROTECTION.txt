The phrase "used for" shall include the phrases "arranged for," "designed for," "intended for," and "occupied for." The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Administrator means the chief building official of the county or such other person as designated by the board of commissioners to enforce and oversee the enforcement of these regulations.
Buffer means any visual buffer or screening required by any pertinent section of the Liberty County Code of Ordinances or appendix A, zoning.
Building means any structure having a roof supported by columns or walls that encloses a space and is intended for sheltering, housing or enclosing space for any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods or materials of any kind or nature or as further defined in the building code of the county.
Building permit applicant means the person who applies for a building permit.
Caliper means the diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at a point six inches above ground level. This measurement shall be used for nursery-grown trees having a diameter of four inches or less.
Canopy trees means large, preferred trees, which provide canopy over streets and other paved areas. Upon reaching maturity, a canopy tree will achieve a canopy spread of in excess of 40 feet in diameter. Using a radius of 20 feet for calculation purposes, the canopy cover area for one mature tree will be equal to 3.1416 by (20)2 or 1,257 square feet. Total canopy coverage for one acre of land would be equal to 43,560 divided by 1,257, or 35 large canopy trees.
Clearing or clear means the removal of vegetation of two inches DBH (as defined herein) or greater.
County arborist. (Reserved).
Development means the act, process or state of erecting buildings or structures, or making improvements.
Diameter, breast height (DBH) means the diameter or width of the main stem of a tree as measured 4.5 feet above the natural grade at its base. Whenever a branch, limb, defect or abnormal swelling of the trunk occurs at this height, the DBH shall be measured at the nearest point above or below 4.5 feet at which a normal diameter occurs.
Exceptional tree means any tree determined by the board of commissioners, as provided for herein, to be of notable historic interest, high aesthetic value, or of unique character because of species, type, age, or size of the tree.
Fifty percent canopy cover means a canopy expected to be achieved over a 30-year period by the planting of large, preferred trees or the retention of existing canopied trees which result in a minimum of 50 percent cover across the unincorporated areas of the county. Fifty percent canopy cover will be approximately 18 large, preferred trees per acre, quantified as 1,600 tree quality points per acre.
Greenspace means any area retained as permeable unpaved ground and dedicated to supporting vegetation.
Greenspace plan means a map and/or other supporting documentation, which describes for a particular site where vegetation (greenspace) is to be retained or planted in compliance with this article.

The landscape plan shall also include any buffer elements.
Landscape quality point means a unit of measurement, which quantifies the relative value of shrubs, groundcover and vines which are planted or retained on a given site. Landscape quality points are also given to small and medium trees planted on the site. A landscape quality point, like a tree quality point, quantitatively expresses the desirable qualities of the species with regard to the size, density and landscape attributions.
Plot plan means a map and/or other supporting documentation describing for a particular site where the buildings, driveways, utility corridors and easements are to be located and where greenspace is to be retained or planted in compliance with this article.

Sketch plan means a conceptual layout for a subdivision as specified in the county subdivision regulations.
Species diversity means a planting or retention of diverse tree species on a site or within the community to prevent dominance by any single type of tree. Species diversity is intended to prevent the destruction of the entire urban forest in the event of disease or pestilence.
Tree easement means an easement, not less than ten feet in width, and such easement shall not be in conflict with any other planning requirements as set forth under the zoning and subdivision regulations, pertaining to the public planting and/or maintenance of canopy street trees, exclusive of utility, drainage or other easements. Administrative approval is required for easements greater than ten feet in width.
Tree establishment plan means a map and supporting documentation, which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be planted in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points.
Tree fund means a fund maintained by the county for the purpose of planting required trees. An owner, developer, and/or building permit applicant may contribute to such a fund.
Tree protection plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained in compliance with the requirements as set forth in these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points.
Tree protection zone means the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines as set forth in these regulations.
Tree quality point means a unit of measurement, which quantifies the relative value of trees that are planted or retained on a given site. Tree quality points quantitatively express the desirable qualities of the species with respect to size for each tree that is retained on a site.

Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 8-272. - Tree protection and tree establishment.
(a)
Protection of preserved or planted trees. Tree protection zones shall be established and maintained on a site for all trees, reserved or planted, for which tree quality points are to be claimed. The following provisions apply to such zones and the trees within them:
(1)
A tree protection plan and details shall accompany all applications for land clearing and/or land-disturbing activities. The tree protection plan shall identify where and how existing trees are to be protected during clearing and construction of the project. Such tree protection plan and details shall be approved by the administrator upon a finding that the plan adequately addresses the problems of the site in protecting the existing trees.
(2)
The area within any tree protection zone shall remain open and unpaved. The use of perforated pavers may be allowed subject to the approval of the administrator.
(3)
No vehicles shall be parked, or construction material stored or substances poured or disposed of or placed, within any tree protection zone at any time during clearing or construction of the project.
(4)
No change in grade within the tree protection zone shall be allowed around existing trees except for a maximum addition of two inches of mulch unless approved by the administrator.
(5)
To protect preserved trees from grade changes, which result in changes of water supply to the tree protection zone, tree wells or tree walls (islands) shall be constructed as needed. Adequate means for drainage of excess moisture from the tree protection zone shall be provided where tree wells or tree walls are constructed.
(6)
All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated so as to prevent damage to the trees from environmental changes (such as a lower water table) or land disturbance resulting from any building or facility construction within or immediately adjacent to the critical root zones of the trees.
(7)
No artificial plants, trees, or like materials shall be counted toward meeting the standards of this article.
(8)
For planted trees, the following tree protection standards and requirements shall apply:
a.
The minimum size tree protection zone centered upon the planted tree shall be as specified in Table 1 as follows:

(9)
Irrigation requirements. Except as provided for herein, irrigation shall be provided for tree protection zones in the following manner:
a.
A permanent water source shall be installed not less than 100 feet from each tree protection zone, but shall not encroach more than 12 inches into any tree protection zone.
b.
All trees within a tree protection zone must have:
1.
A permanent water source within 100 feet; or
2.
A permanent water source at the perimeter of the tree protection zone where that tree protection zone has a radius of greater than 100 feet.
c.
The minimum permanent water source permissible under these provisions shall be a hose bib capable of delivering a minimum of three gallons per minute.
d.
All irrigation systems connected to any potable water supply shall prevent contamination of the potable water supply according to county standards; provided however, irrigation shall not be required where:
1.
Existing individual trees or clumps or groups of existing trees or wooded areas are to be preserved and grading, filling or other land-disturbing activities have not disturbed the natural ground water supply to such trees; or
2.
For planted trees it is determined by the administrator that the natural condition is sufficient to sustain tree growth.
(b)
Standards and specifications; tree quality points.
(1)
Basis for assigning tree quality points to preserved or planted trees.
a.
All preserved trees must be greater than four inches DBH to qualify for tree quality points.
b.
All large trees, except for conifers, must be at least two-inch caliper to qualify for tree quality points when planted on the site.
c.
All coniferous, including, but not limited to, pines, cedars, and cypress, trees and all medium or small trees must be a minimum of one-inch caliper to qualify for tree quality points when planted on the site.
d.
If multi-trunk trees are planted or preserved the largest trunk only shall qualify for tree quality points.
e.
All planted trees shall conform to the most recent edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (as written by the American Association of Nurserymen). Topped trees shall not be considered for tree quality points.
f.
Lifting or moving trees without adequate support to the root ball shall be sufficient grounds to reject the trees for tree quality points award.
g.
Greater than 50 percent scaffold limbs per tree exhibiting included bark shall be cause for rejection of the tree.
(2)
Tree quality points for planted trees. Tree quality points are assigned to newly planted trees as defined in Table 2. The species listed are contained in the tree quality points list published and maintained by the administrator.
TABLE 2
TREE QUALITY POINTS FOR PLANTED TREES

  A listing of small, medium and large trees is found within the tree quality points list maintained by the administrator.
(3)
Tree quality points for preserved trees. Tree quality points for trees preserved on the site are directly related to the tree species quality and the tree protection zone that must be provided for the tree. Tree quality points for preserved trees are calculated by squaring the tree's diameter at breast height (DBH) and multiplying this number by the applicable tree quality points factor. The mathematical formula is:
(DBH) 2 × (Quality Points Factor) = Tree Quality Points
The tree quality points factor is found in Table 3.

  (4)
Tree quality points for preserved stands of trees. The preservation of mature native stands of trees and understory vegetation shall have the value of 0.25 tree quality points and 0.10 landscape quality points per square foot of preserved area. To determine if a stand of trees should be preserved and assigned tree quality points, the following specifications shall apply:
a.
The administrator shall visit the site in order to verify that the stand contains native or extant trees of sufficient size, quantity and quality to warrant reservation as a stand. The administrator shall review the types of tree species located on the site, the quantity of trees within each species, the degree of crown closure and the trees' condition. Stands found by the administrator to contain an insufficient number of mature native trees shall not qualify for quality points under preserved stand calculations. Individual trees, found by the administrator to be unacceptable as a preserved stand, may qualify for tree quality points on an individual basis if the critical root systems of individual trees remain intact.
b.
The stand shall be integrated into a tree protection, tree establishment and landscape plan.
c.
All existing vegetation shall be left within the preserved stand with the exception of hazardous trees. No clearing of underbrush shall be permitted.
d.
The preserved stand shall be protected during the construction period using the same standards and specifications as required for a tree protection zone.
e.
Such preserved stand shall be considered a set-aside and shall be shown within a permanent, recorded tree conservation easement.
(5)
Tree quality points for palm-type trees. Palm-type trees shall be assigned two tree quality points per foot of stem height up to ten feet, regardless of whether the tree is preserved or planted on the site.
(6)
Landscape quality points for small and medium trees, shrubs and ground cover and vines.
a.
Landscape quality points shall be given for planted medium and small trees, shrubs, ground cover and vines on new commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily developments. Tree quality points for preserved medium and small trees may also qualify towards the 400 landscape quality point per acre requirement. To qualify, shrubs shall be planted in a container of a minimum of three gallons. If a shrub is incorporated into a buffer, it must be capable of meeting the height requirements of the buffer within a twelve-month period.
b.
All planted trees shall conform to the most recent edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (written by the American Association of Nurserymen). Topped trees shall not be considered for tree quality points.
c.
Lifting or moving trees without adequate support to the root ball shall be sufficient grounds to reject the trees for tree quality points.

  (c)
Continuing obligation for maintenance. The following maintenance standards apply to all trees, which are planted or preserved on a site in order to meet the minimum tree and landscape quality point requirements as set forth in this section. Other trees on the site are exempt from these requirements.
(1)
Any damage or injury occurring to a preserved tree, by determination of the administrator, sufficient to cause the tree to die within five years or develop into an irreparable hazard tree, shall be removed and shall lose tree quality points. Any tree so removed from the site shall be replaced with a tree of equal or greater tree quality points.
(2)
Damage not considered by the administrator to be fatal to a preserved tree or hazardous to the public shall be immediately repaired but shall result in a proportional decrease in tree quality points, where applicable.
(3)
The property owner shall be solely responsible for watering and fertilizing trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required number of tree quality points on the property shall be a violation of this article.
(d)
Trees adjacent to county-owned property.
(1)
A property owner responsible for any land-disturbing activity within proximity to the critical root zone of a tree located on county property shall provide for the protection of such tree to the standards described in this article. All work on county rights-of-way requires a permit from the county, and violations are subject to an immediate stop-work order.
(2)
If a tree is recommended for removal from a county right-of-way by other county agencies, the administrator shall participate in the review process. Any tree removal on county property shall be coordinated with the administrator, and issues of mitigation for the tree removal shall be addressed by the administrator.
(3)
A property owner responsible for a land-disturbing activity that causes damage to a tree on county property which affects the health or growth of such tree, or removes a tree, shall compensate the county for such tree loss or damage as set forth below:
a.
The administrator shall assess tree quality points for the removed or damaged tree. The property owner responsible for the land-disturbing activity, which caused the removal or damage to such tree shall compensate the county for such tree loss or damage under one of the following options, subject to the approval of the administrator:
1.
Plant or preserve additional trees on the development site which equal or exceed the value of the tree quality points previously assessed to the removed or damaged tree.
2.
Plant trees on adjacent county rights-of-way that equal or exceed the value of the tree quality points that were assessed for the removed or damaged tree. The property owner shall coordinate with the administrator to select the species, set up a plant acceptance date and to have the administrator observe the planting of the tree.
3.
Donate a gift-in-kind to the county tree fund, for a tree whose value equals or exceeds the value of the tree quality points that were assessed for the removed or damaged tree.
4.
Meet any equivalent combination of the above as approved by the administrator.
b.
Once the administrator has approved a method for compensating the county for the damaged tree, the owner of the development shall submit to the administrator, for approval, a revised tree protection and tree establishment plan incorporating the approved tree compensation plan.
(e)
Designation of exceptional trees. Trees designated exceptional shall thereafter be considered a public landmark and shall not be destroyed or endangered. The following procedures and criteria shall be applied in determining whether a tree shall be designated an exceptional tree.
(1)
All nominations for exceptional tree designation shall be reviewed by the administrator who shall make recommendation on such nomination to the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may, on their own initiative or upon a petition, designate a tree as "exceptional," as defined in this article.
(2)
The designation of an exceptional tree shall be based upon an evaluation of the tree in relation to one or more of the following criteria:
a.
Sufficient facts have been presented to the board of commissioners to demonstrate that the tree has an association with a documented historical event, or is located on an historic site.
b.
The tree has unusually high aesthetic value.
c.
The tree possesses unique characteristics because of its age, species, variety, location, or the size and development of its crown, trunk, or main stem.
(3)
All trees, at the time of designation, as an exceptional tree shall meet all of the following criteria:
a.
The tree is free of disease, pests and other serious injury.
b.
The tree has a life expectancy of more than ten years.
c.
The tree is free from structural defects, which would present a hazard to the public.
(4)
Protection. Upon designation as an exceptional tree, the tree shall be protected from land-clearing activities, as provided in this section, and the tree quality points assigned to the tree shall be based upon a tree quality points factor of 2.5 (60 percent more tree quality points than a preferred tree of equal DBH).

Employee and customer parking areas shall be clearly delineated to separate them from outdoor display, sales, and storage areas. Such parking areas shall provide a minimum of 1,200 tree quality points per acre in canopy trees and 400 landscape quality points per acre in landscaping.
b.
Porous paving may be used within outdoor display, sales and parking areas to provide root growth area for new and existing trees.
(3)
Cellular phone towers. Due to the size and location of many cellular tower sites, it is often impracticable to plant the required landscaping on the site; therefore, the administrator may approve any of the following three alternatives:
a.
Planting large canopy trees within the front yard setback along the roadways if there are no conflicting utility locations. The required tree and landscape quality points may be combined together to provide tree quality points for the site.
b.
When utilities or site constraints do not allow planting within the front yard setback, plantings may be approved off-site at other locations within the immediate neighborhood. Trees may be planted either in the county right-of-way where there are no utilities, or in street tree easements on private property.
c.
When there are no viable locations either on site or within the immediate vicinity, a contribution may be made to the county tree fund.
(4)
Stormwater detention areas. Where planting within a stormwater detention area will help it function more efficiently and help make the detention area more visually attractive, such plantings are permitted subject to the following conditions:
a.
The centerline of the trough of a storm drainage easement shall remain free of debris and plantings, with the exception of grasses or ground cover material, which stabilizes the bare soil. This area shall be maintained so that the flow of water is not impeded. Plantings of shrubbery and trees shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet, or as approved by the administrator, from the centerline of the trough so as to keep the area clear for water flow.
b.
The area immediately surrounding drainage structures, including, but not limited to, grates, inlets and weirs shall be kept free from plantings and mulch to keep debris from clogging the structures and impeding the flow of water. All trees and shrubs shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet from such structures.
c.
All trees in the immediately surrounding area of a storm detention area shall be kept a minimum distance of ten feet from the centerline of the basin, or one-third the width of the basin floor, whichever is greater.
d.
Shrubbery shall be excluded from the basin floor and banks. Shrubs may be planted at the top of the basin where there is no likelihood of the rootballs lifting out of the ground when the basin is filled with water.
e.
Vegetation for drainage basin areas. Species of vegetation to be planted in or near detention basins and drainage ways are to be reviewed and approved by the administrator.
(g)
Development and expansion of existing property. One thousand six hundred tree quality points per acre and 400 landscape quality points per acre shall be provided for that portion which is being developed.
