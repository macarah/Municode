Section 17. - Limitations on powers.
No power or combination of powers vested in the commission by Section 8 or any other provision of this Act may be exercised in any manner to amend, change, supersede, or repeal, directly or indirectly, any powers vested in the chairman by this Act.
Section 18. - Commissioner districts.
Editor's note— Former section 18 described the geographical areas of the districts from which members of the board of commissioners were elected as set forth in 1992 Ga. Laws, page 6592. This act was repealed because it did not meet the approval of the U.S. Attorney General in accordance with section 3 of such act. Descriptions of current election districts are on file and maintained in the office of the county election superintendent.
