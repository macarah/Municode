Sec. 102-3. - Non-conforming uses.
3.1.
Nonconforming uses and structures.
1.
Purpose and intent. The purpose of a zoning ordinance is to have orderly use of property. Nonconforming uses that existed legally prior to June 1987 (hereinafter the "adoption") or change of a zoning ordinance create land uses that do not conform to the zoning ordinance. It is the purpose of this nonconforming use provision to allow legally existing nonconforming uses to be retained with certain limitations to protect adjacent property owners and the public from the inconsistencies created by nonconforming uses, but it is the intent that over time all nonconforming uses will be eliminated or brought to conform with this chapter.
2.
Single family residential exemption. A single family residential dwelling unit that is being continuously used for residential use may be rebuilt, enlarged, and improved to the extent that such rebuilding, enlarging, and improvement does not violate an existing fire, safety, or health standard or ordinance shall be exempted from the requirements of this section.
3.
Continuance of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land that was legal prior to the enactment of the adoption of the zoning ordinance shall be allowed to legally continue even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter, subject to the following:
(a)
The nonconforming use cannot be expanded to occupy a greater area of land or building area.
(b)
The nonconforming use may continue only in the original building structure or land area that was originally occupied by the nonconforming use.
(c)
The nonconforming use of the building, structure or land cannot be intensified or escalated, for example, by increasing the number of deliveries, employees or customers coming to the nonconforming use, or noise, dust, fumes or other pollutants emanating from the nonconforming use.
(d)
A nonconforming use cannot be reinstated after it has been abandoned for a 12-month period of time. It shall be prima facia evidence of abandonment for the owner and/or operator of the nonconforming use to discontinue the nonconforming use for 12 months, to fail to obtain a new or renew an existing business license/occupational tax certificate, or like permit as required under the this Code for the operation of such nonconforming use, or to fail to declare and remit the sales tax required by state law for the nonconforming use.
(e)
Failure to follow any other state, federal or local administrative procedure or regulation that is required for the nonconforming use shall be prima facia evidence of abandonment.
(f)
A nonconforming use cannot be changed to another nonconforming use.
(g)
A nonconforming use must maintain any screening or buffering that existed prior to the use becoming a nonconforming use or that was later voluntarily added.
(h)
A use that constitutes a nuisance as defined by state law is not and cannot become a nonconforming use.
4.
Continuance of nonconforming structure or building. A building or structure that is nonconforming or that contains a nonconforming use at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or at the time of enactment of an amendment to this chapter may be retained, except that it shall not be:
(a)
Enlarged, altered or rebuilt, except for repairs necessary to maintain the structure or building in a safe and sanitary condition.
(b)
Rebuilt, altered or repaired so as to expand the structure or building to occupy a greater area of land or building area.
(c)
A building or structure may be rebuilt, altered or repaired if done in compliance with subsection (b).
5.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a use that is dangerous to the general public to continue to exist. This section shall also not be construed to not require changes to buildings or structures to comply with any fire code, safety code, or other safety ordinance or regulation.
6.
To protect the public from inconsistent zoning requirements and to make nonconforming uses as consistent with conforming uses as possible, nonconforming uses must comply to the extent feasible with zoning requirements such as parking, landscaping, setback, outside storage, screening or buffering requirements for the zoning district or use which may be enacted and do not substantially impact the nonconforming use or nonconforming structure.
7.
Screening. Automobile wrecking and junk yards may continue when screened with a solid fence, wall, or natural screening having a height of at least six feet or that such height as will screen all junk or other materials or vehicles from the view of any adjacent property -owner or from any public road provided that such fence be at least ten feet from any street right-of-way or any zone district boundary. Screening shall shield or obscure one abutting or nearby structure or use from another by opaque fencing, walls, berms, or densely planted vegetation. A fence shall be considered a structural barrier that encloses, screens or demarcates or presents a solid face among or between its constituent members; also, a wall separate from or extending from a building. Affected property owners shall be required to conform to the screening requirements of this section by December 31, 2000.
3.2.

3.3.
Discontinuance of junk yards. All existing non-conforming junk yards shall be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter with regard to screening or be discontinued.
3.4.
Restoration to a safe condition. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the director of community development of the county from requiring the restoration of any building to a safe or sanitary condition pursuant to any applicable federal, state or local law.

5.17.
Greenspace required.
A.
Findings.
(1)
Greenspace provides a recognizable and substantial benefit to the residents of new developments and contributes to the overall quality of life in the unincorporated county. Greenspace encourages conservation of land and the preservation of greenspace, wildlife habitat, environmental resources, and the enjoyment of private community facilities.
(2)
The board of commissioners determines that the creation and establishment of permanent greenspace discourages the premature and unnecessary conversion of greenspace lands to urban uses and protects against the resultant adverse impacts, such as air, noise and water pollution, traffic congestion, destruction of scenic beauty, disturbance of the ecology and environment, hazards related to geology, fire and flood, and other demonstrated consequences of urban sprawl. Furthermore, greenspace and greenways add value to neighboring houses and adjacent properties.
B.
Purpose.
(1)
To provide a requirement for private greenspace amenities to developments, and alternatively a payment in-lieu for smaller size set-asides.
(2)
To preserve approximately 20 percent of the occupied site acreage as meaningful greenspace. The occupied site acreage means all land within the development less the land necessary for laying out streets. Developments having densities greater than two dwelling units per acre shall be required to provide additional greenspace.
C.
Definitions.
(1)
A larger common plan of development or sale means a contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct construction activities are occurring under one plan of development or sale. For the purposes of this definition, "plan" means an announcement; piece of documentation such as a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design; or physical demarcation such as boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings, indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot.
(2)
Buffer means as an open space, landscaped area, fence, wall, berm, or any combination thereof used to physically separate or screen one use or property from another so as to visually shield or block noise, lights, other uses or nuisances.
(3)
Development means a subdivision plan, rezoning application, conditional use application, building permit, or land use permit.
(4)
Greenspace shall include the following:
(a)
Permanently protected land, including agricultural and forestry land whose development rights have been severed from the property, that is in its undeveloped, natural state;
(b)
Outdoor improved recreation, including but not limited to any amenity package, which may include but not be limited to a swimming pool, tot lot, playground, clubhouse, tennis, handball, volleyball, basketball, sidewalks, bike and pedestrian paths and benches, areas which include fields for competitive sports, golf courses, amphitheaters, and capital improvements needed to support such facilities;

(d)
A greenway corridor that connects separate parcels of wildlife habitat, between which some species could not travel unless the greenway remains intact;
(e)
A private park that features scenic views;
(f)
Water bodies, land located within the 100-year floodplain, and utility easements may be used to partially fulfill greenspace requirements, however any overall credit received from such water and floodplain type lands and utility easements shall be reduced by 50 percent; by way of example, and not being limited to the foregoing, one acre of floodplain shall be credited as 0.50 acres of greenspace; furthermore, such water, floodplain type lands, and utility easements shall not exceed 50 percent of the required greenspace for the development unless the proposed greenspace provides exceptional recreational and/or environmental benefit by virtue of its location, connectivity to other greenspace or other exceptional qualities; and
(g)
Parking areas, road right-of-ways, impervious surfaces, retention ponds and yards with dwellings may not be included in determining greenspace, unless the greenspace contains features that demonstrate an exceptional recreational and/or environmental benefit by virtue of its location, connectivity to other greenspace or other exceptional qualities.
D.
Application and exemptions.
(1)
Application. Development that is equal to or greater than five acres shall comply with this section. However, development that consists of less than five acres shall comply with this section where the development is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
(2)
Exemptions. Development in an agricultural zoning district having a lot or parcel size equal to or greater than five acres and development within a PUD zoning district shall not be required to comply with this section.
(3)
Payment in-lieu. Where the total greenspace of a development contains equal to or less than three acres, the applicant may seek to provide, and the county may accept, a payment in-lieu of providing private greenspace.
E.
Greenspace requirements.
(1)
Unless modified by the board of commissioners fora specified public purpose at the time of zoning, the set-aside of greenspace acreage shall be required according to Table 1, entitled Required Greenspace.

Ownership and maintenance.
(1)
Ownership. Greenspace shall be owned by all land owners of the development as tenants in common.
(2)
Greenspace covenant. A greenspace covenant setting forth the requirements of section 5.17 shall be placed upon the development at or before the filing of the final plat. The greenspace covenant shall provide for the permanent protection of the greenspace. The greenspace covenant shall not be less than 20 years.
(3)
Maintenance. The county subdivision ordinance shall regulate the design, construction, and maintenance of the greenspace, and the applicant shall demonstrate that all greenspace shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the county subdivision ordinance.
G.
Form of greenspace.
(1)
Greenspace shall form sizable contiguous blocks of land that are accessible to residents of the development and, where possible, shall be designated as one separate parcel of land.
(2)
Buffers. Buffers protect the county's rural character and in shielding a development from incompatible adjacent uses.
(a)
Lands in the form of thin buffers (e.g., thin ribbons), around the development are strongly discouraged. Buffers serve a different (but important) function than greenspace.
(b)
Any strip of land that measures 20 feet or less shall constitute a buffer.
(c)
Applicants may count ten percent of a buffer area toward the development's overall greenspace amount, provided that the buffer is placed in a separate parcel.
H.
Cash payment in-lieu of land set-aside.
(1)
If the total greenspace falls below three acres, the county may allow the payment of a fee in-lieu of set-aside of land based on the appraised value of the land being platted and the amount of land required to be set-aside, if, in the judgment of the county, the quantity of land to be subdivided is of a size or configuration that set-aside of greenspace:
(a)
Is not feasible or practical; or
(b)
Will not create a parcel suitable for greenspace purposes listed herein, as defined in section 5.17C.(4).
(2)
The fee shall be paid at the time of final platting.
(3)
Appraisal requirements. The developer shall furnish an appraisal of land value for the purpose of determining the cash payment due in-lieu of land set-aside. The appraisal shall determine fair market value based upon an appraisal methodology consistent with the uniform standards of professional appraisals or other real estate valuation techniques approved and used the state when expending state funds for land acquisition. The appraisal shall be prepared by a certified appraiser and shall indicate the fair market value of the land within the proposed subdivision as rezoned and platted by the county. The director of community development may consider and, if appropriate, accept an another method of appraisal for applications involving one lot.
(4)
The county authorizes the director of community development, or his designee, to determine the fee to be paid to the county as a payment in-lieu based upon the standards set forth herein.
(5)
All fees in-lieu of set-aside payments shall be deposited in a separate fund established by the board of commissioners, and such funds and the interest thereon shall be used only for the purchase and development of public greenspace.
I.
Resubdividing greenspace; certain resubdivisions prohibited. All lands subdivided after adoption of this section shall comply with the requirements set forth herein. Where any development, which has previously complied with this section by setting-aside or providing a cash payment in-lieu of land set-aside, recombines or combines lawfully platted lots so as to create a smaller number of resultant lots by resubdivision, the subdivider shall not receive a credit for greenspace previously set-aside or a refund for cash payment made in-lieu of land set-aside. In no instance will lands set-aside, or cash payments made in-lieu of land set-aside, be returned to the applicant as a result of resubdivsion.
J.
Previously approved greenspace.
(1)
Where a development, which has previously received zoning approval from the board of commissioners, was approved with a zoning condition or stipulation that requires the applicant, owner, or subdivider to set aside a certain percentage or acreage for greenspace, and the zoning condition or stipulation is contained in (i.e., spread upon), the official minutes of the board of commissioners, the applicant, owner, or subdivider shall be required to set aside said greenspace that may be identified in a development plan.
(2)
If the percentage or acreage for greenspace is more than that percentage required by this section, the greater percentage (i.e., that approved by the board of commissioners), shall apply.
(3)
If the percentage or acreage for greenspace is less restrictive or no requirement was provided, the requirements set forth in section 5.17E., the requirements as set forth in section 5.17E. shall apply.
K.
Modifications and exceptions. The chairman and board of commissioners may modify or make exceptions from the standards and requirements set forth in section 5.17.
5.18.
Unimproved roads—Study required.
1.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a supplemental report requirement where an applicant proposes a rezoning application, conditional use application, or other application that increases the traffic volume upon adjacent unimproved public roads. Rural development is often served by unimproved public road, which are defined as dirt, gravel roads, and unpaved county roads. The density at which land is zoned has an enormous influence on the amount of traffic generated from that land and its subsequent impact on the capacity of the abutting roads. While unimproved roads preserve rural character, a rezoning that increases traffic volumes on adjacent unimproved roads may overload the capacity of unimproved roads and degrade the road beyond the threshold that the road can accommodate.
2.
Finding. Where an applicant proposes a rezoning application, conditional use application, or other application that increases the traffic volume upon adjacent unimproved roads, the board of commissioners finds it necessary to require that the applicant study the proposed impact to the adjacent unimproved roads and submit a report providing detailed findings before the applicant may proceed to a planning commission hearing on the application.
3.
Required study. The study shall include the following information.
A.
Rating the unimproved road. The applicant shall gather basic data, which include traffic volume information, for the affected unimproved road(s). The basic information shall include the physical conditions of the roadway, traffic counts, surface type, road width, drainage features, width of clear zone, road alignment rating (i.e., comfortable travel speed), and any other appropriate criteria.
B.
Gravel road capacity analysis. The applicant shall determine the capacity of each unimproved road affected by the proposed application.
C.
Calculating unused capacity. The applicant shall compare the existing traffic volumes to the capacity threshold. By subtracting out existing traffic volumes from the maximum acceptable volume level for each gravel road segment, the "unused" capacity can be calculated and allocated to the buildable, undeveloped abutting land.
D.
Land access analysis. Using the ITE trip generation manual standard of ten trips per day per single-family residential dwelling unit, the number of dwelling units that could be built without exceeding existing road capacity is then calculated (assuming no additional through traffic).
E.
Building analysis. Similarly, the maximum number of dwelling units that are permitted under existing zoning can be calculated and then compared with existing unused capacity from he last step.
4.
Development agreements.
A.
In the event the report or the county planner or department designee's analysis indicates that the unimproved road is not adequate, lacks capacity to carry additional traffic volumes, or falls below the county's level of service standards, the applicant and the county may enter into a development agreement, pursuant to which the applicant shall agree to provide the necessary public facility or facilities at the applicant's sole cost and expense, to service the proposed development in accordance with the provisions of this section. The development agreement shall provide that all such public facilities shall be constructed or bonded prior to the issuance of a building permit for all or any portion of the proposed development.
B.
The county authorizes and delegates to the chairman of the board of commissioners to authorization to enter into a development agreement with an applicant pursuant to this section only if the chairman finds that the proposed development which is the subject of this section meets all requirements of this section, the county zoning regulations, the county subdivision regulations, and all other applicable regulations. Further, the county hereby authorizes the chairman of the board of commissioners to execute a development agreement (s) and otherwise to perform all acts necessary to deliver binding development agreements for the completion and installation of necessary public facility(s).
5.19.
Permitted residential occupancies. Residential occupancy is permitted only in a conventional home, a manufactured home, or an industrialized dwelling, each as defined in section 4 of the county zoning regulations and as approved by DCA.
1.
Residential occupancy is prohibited in any structure, vehicle, or other shelter which is not a conventional home, a manufactured home, or an industrialized dwelling. Such prohibited residential occupancies include but are not limited to: recreational vehicles; shipping containers; accessory buildings or accessory structures; "tiny homes" which do not fall under the definition of a conventional home, manufactured home, or industrialized dwelling; and tents and other camping arrangements.
2.
The provisions of this section 5.19 shall be in addition to all applicable requirements for the district in which the subject use or occupancy is located and all other applicable requirements of the county zoning regulations and the county Code of Ordinances. This section 5.19 shall not be interpreted to expand the permitted or conditional uses of any district.
(Ord. of 7-14-98(2), § 5.0; Res. of 7-13-99(1), § II; Res. of 4-11-00(1); Ord. of 10-16-01(1), § 1; Ord. of 3-5-02(1), § 1; Ord. of 8-6-02(1), § 1; Ord. of 8-6-02(2); Ord. of 10-19-04(1), § 1; Ord. of 10-19-04(2), § 1; Ord. of 4-5-05(1), § 2; Ord. of 10-1-19; Ord. of 8-4-20(1), §§ 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9; Res. of 10-4-22(3), § 1)
Sec. 102-6. - Establishment of districts.
For the purpose of this chapter, the unincorporated area of the county is divided into zoning districts designated as follows:
Agricultural (A);
Residential (R);
Manufactured Home Subdivision (MHS);
Commercial (C);
Industrial (I);
Office and Institutional (OI); and
Technology Park District.
(Ord. of 7-14-98(2), § 6.0; Ord. of 10-1-19; Ord. of 8-4-20(1), §§ 6, 7, 9)
Sec. 102-7. - Location and boundaries of zoning districts.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the map or maps excerpted therefrom entitled "The Carroll County Zoning Map" which are hereby made and incorporated into this chapter by reference, which may be amended from time to time and which shall be kept in the office of the county commissioner chairman. The official county zoning map shall be available for public inspection in said office.
7.1.
Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district in the county, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines.
(2)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of the street, county road, state highway, interstate highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.
(3)
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the scaled distance from the lot lines. In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the zoning district boundary line.
(4)
In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets, that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot.
(5)
Undeveloped property which has been deannexed from any municipality or other county will be subject to the same zoning district, including any conditions prior to annexation. However, if the zoning district within the county cannot be determined from existing records or by the county planner, a public hearing, as specified in this chapter before the planning commission, will be conducted to establish the appropriate zoning classification for the property. Any lawfully developed, deannexed property shall be zoned to the nearest compatible zoning district in which the use is permitted.

1.0
Purpose. It is essential that the quality and supply of public drinking water be reasonably protected. This chapter provides for the establishment of buffer zones around streams, specifies allowable impervious surface densities within watersheds, and requires the use of best management practices for land use within the water supply districts. Natural protection such as buffer areas are best able to filter rainfall and stormwater runoff prior to that water flowing into perennial streams, which lead to water supply reservoirs. Minimizing the transport of pollutants and sediments to the water supply reservoirs guarantees a healthy yield from the water supply watersheds. This protection is necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety and welfare as well as to assure that surface sources of drinking water are of high quality and reasonably free from contaminating sources in order to be treated to meet all state and federal drinking water standards.

The Snake Creek Watershed Protection District.
15.1.
Regulations for development with the Snake Creek Watershed Protection District.
In order that Carroll County and surrounding areas may continue to have a health economic climate, it is essential that adequate supplies of drinking water be assured. Conflicts can arise in meeting this goal when industrial, urban or suburban development occurs within area that are close to water supply reservoirs or the drainage areas supplying water to said reservoirs. Sedimentation and erosion from development reduce the storage capacity of reservoirs. Storm water runoff from developed areas can introduce pollutants into the drinking water supply, making water treatment more complicated and expensive. Effluent from nearby wastewater treatment plants can release phosphorus and other pollutants into the water supply, making water either undrinkable, expensive to treat, or unusable for recreation purposes. Certain types of industrial land uses create the risk of chemical spills occurring and contaminating the nearby reservoir before the spill can be contained.
The purpose of the Snake Creek Watershed Protection District is to establish measures to protect the quality of the present and future water supply for Carroll County and neighboring localities. Because these protective measures allow some latitude with the land uses, and because the district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather a range of acceptable land uses, the Snake creek Watershed Protection District is designed as an overlay district. Within the range of land uses that can be located within the district, there are established in this section performance standards that apply to development that occurs in that district.
The purpose of this ordinance is to create a zoning district to be known as the Snake Creek Watershed Protection District (hereinafter referred to as the "district"), which such area has a unique environmental importance to Carroll County.
The ordinance is intended to maintain the current high water quality of the surface water (rivers, creeks, streams and spring) and underground water of the Snake Creek Watershed Basin and to preserve and ensure that same continuing high water quality of said basin for the future. The zoning for said district is intended to provide for certain permitted uses as hereinafter provided and to protect the underground and surface water of said basin from polluting effects of uncontrolled development and from encroachments of those uses that are not compatible with a protected watershed.
15.2.
Establishment of district. The Snake Creek Watershed Protection District shall consist of two parts 1) a water quality critical area; and 2) a limited restriction area.
1.
A water quality critical area (hereinafter referred to he "critical area") may be established for land which lies to the shore line of the H.C. Seaton Reservoir and extends within the watershed area of the reservoir to a point beyond either the ridge line of the reservoir watershed or 1,000 feet from the shore lines of the reservoir at flood stage level (defined as height equal to top of spillway of dam) whichever is the shorted distance.
2.
A limited restriction area (hereinafter referred to as the "limited restriction area") shall be established for the watershed area of the Reservoir and Snake Creek (primary stream serving the reservoir) and shall include the headwaters if Snake Creek and the surface waters and tributaries flowing into Snake Creek. The limited restriction area shall encompass all of these surface waters, tributaries, and creeks feeding Snake Creek and the Reservoir and an area defined as 150 feet wide on both sides of the designated streams plus an area within 150 feet of the Reservoir shore line at flood stage level (defined as height equal to top of spillway dam).

1.
No building or accessory buildings shall be constructed any lower than the maximum flood elevation for a distance of one mile downstream from the dam of the reservoir.
15.10.
Impervious surface limitations. In order to prevent an excessive amount of storm-water runoff from damaging the water quality of the reservoir, it is necessary to encourage as much infiltration as possible of runoff from hard surfaces onto land area, which can absorb and filter runoff. For the purposes of this section, an impervious surface us defined as a surface composed of any material that impedes or prevents natural infiltration of water into the soil impervious surfaces may include, but are not limited to: roofs, streets, parking area, tennis courts, driveways, patios, sidewalks, and any concrete, asphalt or compacted gravel surface. Impervious surface calculations for an individual development shall be cumulative for original construction or any subsequent additions, which are made. The following impervious surface limits shall be applied to the district as specified below.
1.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within 150 feet setback from reservoir flood stage level or within a 150 feet setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
2.
There shall be limitation of no more than 25 percent of the land area or the existing use, whichever is greater of that portion of a single development located within the boundaries of the limited restriction area, which may be covered by an impervious surface. Roof areas of residential buildings not in excess of roof runoff is kept from directly or indirectly entering the street or parking/driveway drainage systems, but is directed rather onto lawn or natural vegetation area within the confides of the particular lot or development in which the roof is located.
15.11.
Special runoff and drainage requirements. It is necessary to impose several requirements on development in the district in order to prevent damage to water quality that is not necessarily attributed to an individual property within a development. These requirements are as specified below:
1.
Stormwater runoff retention. For development within the district, measure shall be employed to infiltrate, retain or detain (detention being least preferred) stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces. Methods to accomplish that infiltration, retention or detention shall be shown on the development site plan. The area to which this requirement shall apply may be for each individual lot within a single development, or the development as a whole. If the developer elects to satisfy this requirement for the development as a whole, the site plan shall indicate how many devices or structures used to accomplish retention, infiltration or detention shall be maintained. The developer will not be required to employ measures to retain or detain runoff from driveways walkways or patios located on private residential lots as long as the runoff from said surfaces is controlled to allow infiltration of the same into surrounding lawn or ground cover.
2.
Buffer zones around reservoir and along streams. A 100-foot wide buffer zone shall be maintained in all banks surrounding the Reservoir. Said buffer zone shall start at the high water flood level of the Reservoir and extend outward. A 100-foot wide buffer zone shall be maintained on both sides of all perennial streams within the limited restriction area. Said buffer zone shall begin at the top of the adjoining banks on the streams.
Briars and dead brush in the buffer zones may be removed by the land owner. Ground within this buffer zone may be only minimally distributed; it may be bush hogged, but it may not be plowed or harrowed or otherwise distributed. Flowering shrubs and trees may be planted in the buffer, and grasses may be sown, however no pesticides, herbicides or other weed killer compounds may be used in this area. Animals shall be permitted to graze in the buffer, but excessive grazing which results in all vegetation being stripped from the buffer zone will not be allowed. Timber may be harvested in a controlled method, with trees to be cut to fall away from the stream. Stumps may be individually removed if the hole is filled and steps are taken to prevent erosion.
3.
Street runoff and drainage. New streets constructed within the district shall not require curb and gutter unless otherwise required by subdivision ordinances. New streets, which cross perennial stream within the district, shall be designed to limit direct runoff from pavement surfaces into the stream it crosses. Such design features shall be indicated on the site plan submitted by a developer.
Street, crossing, utility lines, recreational and green way facilities and recreation related paved surfaces may be allowed as exceptions to vegetative buffer requirement in buffer area, flood ways and flood way fringe areas. However, such intrusion shall be minimized or mitigate to the extent possible.
15.12.
Pre-existing conditions. All parcels of land within the district at the time of the passage of this ordinance [from which this section derived] that do not conform or come within the permitted uses or the minimum standards hereinafter set out shall be governed by the Zoning Regulations of Carroll County, Georgia, as amended, as it relates to nonconforming uses and activities.
15.13.
Zoning and building permits. The following additional requirement must be met prior to obtaining rezoning or building permits within the district
1.
Should the owner of a lot, parcel or tract of land, lying within 150 feet of any surface water in the Limited Area of the district purpose to develop any portion of the property, the owner or his authorized agent shall submit a topographical survey or drawing to scale showing the exact location of the surface water and its relationship to the property to be developed.
15.14.
Variances. Variances may be made by the governing authority of Carroll County or by any municipal governing authority located in the district as to lot sizes, uses and activities, provided that sewage generated by the facility located on said property is serviced by an approved public agricultural or industrial facilities which uses, makes or creates as a product or byproduct any toxic substance wastes.

Special runoff and drainage requirements. It is necessary to impose several requirements on development in the district in order to prevent damage to water quality that is not necessarily attributed to an individual property within a development. These requirements are as specified below:
1.
Stormwater runoff retention. For development within the district, measure shall be employed to infiltrate, retain or detain (detention being least preferred) stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces. Methods to accomplish that infiltration, retention or detention shall be shown on the development site plan. The area to which this requirement shall apply may be for each individual lot within a single development, or the development as a whole. If the developer elects to satisfy this requirement for the development as a whole, the site plan shall indicate how many devices or structures used to accomplish retention, infiltration or detention shall be maintained. The developer will not be required to employ measures to retain or detain runoff from driveways walkways or patios located on private residential lots as long as the runoff from said surfaces is controlled to allow infiltration of the same into surrounding lawn or ground cover.
2.
Buffer zones around reservoir and along streams. A 100-foot wide buffer zone shall be maintained in all banks surrounding the Reservoir. Said buffer zone shall start at the high water flood level of the Reservoir and extend outward. A 100-foot wide buffer zone shall be maintained on both sides of all perennial streams within the limited restriction area. Said buffer zone shall begin at the top of the adjoining banks on the streams.
i.
Briars and dead brush in the buffer zones may be removed by the land owner. Ground within this buffer zone may be only minimally distributed; it may be bush hogged, but it may not be plowed or harrowed or otherwise distributed. Flowering shrubs and trees may be planted in the buffer, and grasses may be sown, however no pesticides, herbicides or other weed killer compounds may be used in this area. Animals shall be permitted to graze in the buffer, but excessive grazing which results in all vegetation being stripped from the buffer zone will not be allowed. Timber may be harvested in a controlled method, with trees to be cut to fall away from the stream. Stumps may be individually removed if the hole is filled and steps are taken to prevent erosion.
3.
Street runoff and drainage. New streets constructed within the district shall not require curb and gutter unless otherwise required by subdivision ordinances. New streets, which cross perennial stream within the district, shall be designed to limit direct runoff from pavement surfaces into the stream it crosses. Such design features shall be indicated on the site plan submitted by a developer.
i.
Street, crossing, utility lines, recreational and green way facilities and recreation related paved surfaces may be allowed as exceptions to vegetative buffer requirement in buffer area, flood ways and flood way fringe areas. However, such intrusion shall be minimized or mitigate to the extent possible.
16.8.
Pre-existing conditions. All parcels of land within the district at the time of the passage of this ordinance that do not conform or come within the permitted uses or the minimum standards hereinafter set out shall be governed by the Zoning Regulations of Carroll County, Georgia, as amended, as it relates to nonconforming uses and activities.
16.9.
Zoning and building permits. The following additional requirement must be met prior to obtaining rezoning or building permits within the district.

14.12.
Conditional zoning (use of conditions).
1.
In deciding upon any application for zoning map amendment, the planning commission and board of commissioners may, on their own motion or upon the suggestion of the applicant, grant the application subject to certain conditions or stipulations necessary to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the county. Such conditions shall be imposed for the benefit of the community to lessen any negative effects that the zoning map amendment may cause.
2.
The board of commissioners may grant any zoning map amendment and include conditions, including but not limited to the following:
(a)
Such conditions as are deemed necessary to protect neighbors and to lessen any negative effects of the zoning change;
(b)
Such conditions may consist of specific use restrictions or the following area and building restrictions: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses; driveway curb cut restrictions; restrictions as to what land uses or activities shall be permitted; maximum building heights or other dimensions; special drainage or erosion provisions; landscaping or planted area, which may include the location, type and maintenance of plant materials; fences, walls, berms, or other buffering provisions or protective measures; preservation of existing trees or other vegetation; special measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation when adjacent to residential districts; architectural style; a requirement that the existing building(s) be retained;
(c)
That the rezoning is conditional and binds the applicant and any successor in title who may construct only those uses and only in such a manner as is depicted upon any development plan submitted and approved with the application.
3.
Prior to a vote being taken upon any application for zoning map amendment in which conditions shall be imposed, such conditions will be announced at the hearing, presented in writing as part of the development plan, or recorded as part of the official record, and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to present its position on such conditional requirements. If the applicant finds such proposed conditional requirements to be unacceptable, it may, at that time, withdraw its application for zoning map amendment; such withdrawal shall be subject to the requirements as set forth in sections 102-14(14.7) and (14.8).
4.
If the applicant proposes zoning based upon a development plan, proposes conditions or stipulations in writing, or incorporates conditions as part of a development plan. The written conditions shall be submitted in an appropriate number of copies on 8.5 x 11 paper size to the county planner or their respective designee with the application for rezoning. If conditions are proposed after the application has been submitted, the applicant shall submit an appropriate number of copies of said conditions as an amendment to the application prior to final approval of the rezoning by the board of commissioners. Upon approval by the board of commissioners, such conditions shall by reference become a part of the rezoning record.
5.
If the board of commissioners adopts a zoning map amendment which contains conditional requirements, such requirements shall become a part of this chapter and the official zoning map. Such property shall thereafter carry the suffix "-C" to indicate that such property has been conditionally zoned (e.g., A-C, R30-C, etc.). Such conditions shall be binding upon all owners of the property until removed or modified by the board of commissioners. The county planner, or their designee shall so indicate in the records of the zoning actions the existence of the conditional requirements. If the county planner, or their designee deems it appropriate and feasible, the suffix "-C" shall be affixed to the zoning map for the appropriate property.
6.
A conditional requirement may be imposed upon either permitted and/or conditional uses in any zoning district.
7.
The building inspector shall issue a building permit for the development of the property only in strict compliance with the new zoning category and the further specific conditions added by the applicant and approved by the board of commissioners.
8.
All proposed zoning amendments, including amendments under this conditional zoning, must be submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendation. However, if the conditions established by the applicant in conjunction with an application for conditional zoning are minor and added after planning commission review of the rezoning proposal, or if the conditions are altered or otherwise changed after planning commission action on the rezoning application as originally submitted, the board of commissioners may, in their discretion, require resubmission to, or review by, the planning commission.

Findings.
A.
The chairman and board of commissioners (the "board"), hereby finds that development in the transportation corridors may generate excessive transportation congestion, introduce unacceptable traffic safety hazards, produce fragmented development patterns that may lead to blight, irreparably harm the aesthetic qualities of the transportation corridors and preclude significant long-term economic development opportunities by development with inadequate levels of service and infrastructure and a concomitant harm to the community from inappropriate development within these transportation corridors, and incompatibility between uses and inadequate public facilities and services; [Amended Ord. 10/04/05].
B.
The board hereby finds that the public health, safety and welfare will be enhanced by the regulations of uses and site development in transportation corridors; and [Amended Ord. 10/04/05].
C.
The board hereby finds it to be a matter of compelling public interest and necessity to readopt, re-establish, and continue the corridor protection plan ordinance and its development regulations and standards as established herein. [Amended Ord. 10/04/05].
D.
Administrative review.

If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to the exposed roofing colors on the building.
(f)
For structures on parcels abutting a residential district, no delivery, loading, trash removal or compaction, or other such operations shall be permitted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of 45 dB or less, as measured at the lot line of any adjoining residential property.
B.
Building design.
1.
Facades and exterior walls. The following standards, which apply to all building facades which are visible from adjoining public streets or properties, are intended to reduce the massive scale of large buildings which, without application of these standards, be incompatible with County's desired character.
(a)
Facades greater than 150 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least three percent of the length of the facade and extending at least 20 percent of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 150 horizontal feet.
(b)
Ground floor facades of retail businesses that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than 60 percent of their horizontal length, excepting side and rear facades that are landscaped with a type B bufferyard.
2.
Detail features. Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest, at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and reflect the local character. The following elements should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint: color changes, material changes, texture changes and relief feature (such as offsets, projections and reveals).
3.
Roofs. The following standards are intended to foster variations in roof lines to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features should complement the character of adjoining development. Roofs shall have no less than two of the following features:
(a)
Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment, such as HVAC units from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed 15 percent of the height of the supporting walland such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature three dimensional cornice treatment and shall not be of a constant height for a distance of greater than 150 feet.
(b)
Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three feet past the supporting walls, for no less than 30 percent of the building perimeter.
(c)
Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope greater than or equal to one foot of vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal run and less than or equal to one foot of vertical rise for every one foot of horizontal run.
(d)
Three or more roof slope planes.
4.
Materials and colors. The following standards are intended to ensure that large structures are consistent with the community's aesthetic values:
(a)
Predominant exterior buildings materials shall be high quality materials. These include, without limitation: brick, wood, rock, or tinted and textured concrete masonry units.

(c)
Not more than 20 percent of exterior building materials shall include the following: pre-fabricated steel panels. [Amended Ord. 10/04/05]
5.
Entryways. Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or identified departments of a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.
(a)
All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public street shall feature at least one customer entrance. Where a principal building directly faces more than two abutting public streets, this requirement shall apply only to two sides of the building, including the side of the building facing the transportation corridor, and another side of the building facing another street.
(b)
Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The following standards identify desirable entryway design features. Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three of the following:
