ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 83-1—83-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 83-21. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source discharge and degradation of state waters;
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the county separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system in the MS4 permitted area;
(6)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system.
Therefore, the county adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system in the MS4 permitted area which is depicted in exhibit A attached to an ordinance of January 6, 2015, and incorporated as if set forth fully herein. Pursuant to GaNOI GAG6100000, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

Sec. 83-22. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the county separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the county separate storm sewer system by any person;
(2)
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the county separate storm sewer system;
(3)
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the county separate storm sewer system; and,
(4)
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(b)
Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the MS4 permitted area of the county depicted in the map attached hereto as exhibit A attached to an ordinance of January 6, 2015.
(c)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(d)
Designation of article administrator. The department of public works and/or the department of community development shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.
