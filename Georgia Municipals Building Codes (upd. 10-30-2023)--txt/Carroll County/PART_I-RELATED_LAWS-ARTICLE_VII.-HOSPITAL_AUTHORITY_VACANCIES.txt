Editor's noteâ€” Printed herein is 1974 Ga. Laws, page 2318 which provides the method of filling vacancies in the membership of the Carroll City-County Hospital Authority. The hospital authority was created and established pursuant to a joint resolution dated November 11, 1946, by the board of commissioners of the county and the Carrollton City Council recorded in Minute Book 2, page 124 on file in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. As used in this article, the word "Board" refers to the Board of Directors of the Hospital Authority.

Section 1. - Filling of vacancies.
Vacancies occurring in the membership of the Carroll City-County Hospital Authority for any cause, including the expiration of terms of office, shall be filled by the Board selecting a successor for the position of membership in which the vacancy occurs from a list of three persons which shall be submitted to the Board by the governing authorities of the City of Carrollton and Carroll County.
