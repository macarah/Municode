ARTICLE IV. - WATER AND SEWER RATE STRUCTURE

Sec. 74-571. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to collect the fees necessary to maintain and operate the Bartow County Water and Sewer System, including to pay for the expansion of the system to handle the needs of Bartow County. The county owns and operates public water treatment and transmission/distribution facilities, as well as purchasing potable water from Cartersville and other public water systems. The county owns two wastewater (sewer) treatment facilities, collection/transmission and disposal facilities, as well as sending wastewater to Cartersville and Cobb County for treatment. The county provides water and wastewater services to both residential and nonresidential customers within the unincorporated areas of the county.
As a result of recent growth, regulatory requirements, and the need to prepare for the cost of meeting future system demands, the county conducted a review of water and wastewater rates. Over the last several years, water and wastewater rates have not kept pace with increasing costs. A study was commissioned from consultants Black & Veatch that determined a recommended rate structure to meet the county's goals of full cost recovery of operating the system, including readiness to serve rates sufficient to support future financing of capital projects. In addition, the new rate structure is designed to encourage conservation. Over the next five years, the county anticipates spending approximately $52,000,000.00 on the water and wastewater system to increase capacity by expanding wastewater treatment facilities, adding new water storage tanks, and meeting increasing regulatory requirements (as detailed in the plans of the county and the Black & Veatch study). The rates and charges developed as a result of that study, are designed to both provide the necessary capital to fund expansion of the system and also to provide adequate funding for ongoing operational costs for the system. The readiness to serve fees are specifically calculated as a proportionate share of the impact on the county's capacity of each new user, and are designed to generate the funds sufficient to provide the capacity needed by that user, as well as recover capital costs already expended in providing the existing capacity to serve the user, as allowed under O.C.G.A. § 36-71-13(c), and as approved by the Court of Appeals in City of Griffin v. McDaniel, 270 Ga.App. 349, 606 S.E.2d 607 (2004).

Sec. 74-572. - Monthly rate schedule.
The county shall bill its customers monthly for water and wastewater service, at the following rates. Water and wastewater rates shall be comprised of an availability charge, and a volume charge. The availability charge recovers various fixed costs of providing service, and increases based on the water meter size (in equivalent meter units). The availability and volume charges are billed monthly. Water and wastewater availability rates are both based on the water meter size, converted into equivalent meter units, multiplied by the base charges. The volume charge is based on usage.
(1)
Water rates.
Water availability charge/base charge x EMU of water meter
Water availability base charge .....$4.00 per month
Water volume charge .....3.30 per 1,000 gallons
(2)
Wastewater rates.
Wastewater availability charge/base charge x EMU of water meter
Wastewater availability base charge .....$4.00 per month
Wastewater volume charge .....3.30 per 1,000 gallons
(3)
Equivalent meter units. All availability charges are based on equivalent meter units (EMU), which are shown below, based on the size of the water meter. EMUs are multiplied by the base charges shown above to arrive at the availability charge, as shown by example in subsection (4) below.
EXPAND
Water Meter Size (inches) EMU

1.5" 5.0
2" 8.0
3" 16.0
4" 25.0
6" 50.0
8" 80.0

Examples. The following examples are in effect until December 31, 2006 as water and wastewater availability charges. After that, rates increase pursuant to section 74-579 below.
EXPAND

5/8" or 3/4" $4.00 × 1.0 = $4.00
1" $4.00 × 2.5 = $10.00
1.5" $4.00 × 5.0 = $20.00
2" $4.00 × 8.0 = $32.00
3" $4.00 × 16.0 = $64.00
4" $4.00 × 25.0 = $100.00
6" $4.00 × 50.0 = $200.00
8" $4.00 × 80.0 = $320.00
  (5)
Water conservation surcharge. A water conservation surcharge shall be added to the above rates pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. The "base rate" as referred to in this section, shall mean both the "availability base charge" and the "volume charge" for water and wastewater rates; that is, both charges shall be modified by the percentage multiplier of the water conservation surcharge. The relevant provisions of that ordinance are incorporated herein by reference, as adopted December 6, 2006, and as amended hereinafter in the future.

Sec. 74-573. - Readiness to serve fees.
The county shall collect "readiness to serve fees," which are comprised of several elements. There is both a "water capacity fee" and a "wastewater capacity fee," which fees are based on recovering a proportional cost of water or wastewater capacity provided to the user, and paying for future expansions of capacity necessitated by that user. For the water system, there is also a "distribution and transmission fee," to recover proportional costs of the distribution and transmission system as used by that user and future expansion necessitated by that user. For wastewater (i.e. sewer) there is a "collection fee," to recover the proportional costs of the wastewater collection system as used by that user and future expansion necessitated by that user. These are one-time fees, collected when a new user applies for a water and/or sewer tap. Water and wastewater readiness to serve fees are both based on the water meter size, converted into equivalent meter units, multiplied by the base charges.
(1)
Water readiness to serve fees.
Water capacity fee .....base charge x EMU of water meter
Water capacity base charge .....$1,030.00
Water distribution and transmission fee .....base charge x EMU of water meter
Water distribution and transmission base charge .....600.00
(2)
Wastewater readiness to serve fees.
Wastewater capacity fee .....base charge x EMU of water meter
Wastewater capacity base charge .....$1,260.00, per equivalent meter unit
Wastewater collection fee .....base charge x EMU of water meter
Wastewater collection base charge .....700.00, per equivalent meter unit
(3)
Equivalent meter units. All readiness to serve fees (both water and wastewater) are based on equivalent meter units (EMU), which are shown below, based on the size of the water meter. EMUs are multiplied by the base charges shown above to arrive at the readiness to serve fee.

Examples. The following examples are in effect until December 31, 2006. After that, rates increase pursuant to section 74-576 below. The readiness to serve fee for a standard ⅝-inch residential water meter would be $1,630.00 ($1,030.00 × 1.0, plus $600.00 × 1.0). The readiness to serve fee for wastewater for property where the water meter is ⅝-inch would be $1,960.00 ($1,260.00 × 1.0, plus $700.00 × 1.0). The readiness to serve fee for a four-inch commercial water meter would be $40,750.00 ($1,030.00 × 25.0 = $25,750.00, plus $600.00 × 25.0 = $15,000.00). The readiness to serve fee for wastewater for property where the water meter is four inches would be $49,000.00 ($1,260.00 × 25.0 = $31,500.00, plus $700.00 × 25.0 = $17,500.00).
(5)
Time of payment. The readiness to serve fees shall be due and payable in full at the time of initial application for service. No connections shall be made to the water or sewer system until all such fees have been accepted by the county.
