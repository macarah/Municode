Redevelopment means structural development (construction, installation, or expansion of a building or other structure), creation or addition of impervious surfaces, replacement of impervious surfaces not as part of routine maintenance, and land disturbing activities associated with structural or impervious development on a previously developed site. Redevelopment does not include such activities as exterior remodeling.
Routine maintenance means activities to keep an impervious surface as near as possible to its constructed condition. This includes ordinary maintenance activities, resurfacing paved areas, and exterior building changes or improvements which do not materially increase or concentrate stormwater runoff, or cause additional nonpoint source pollution.

Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before August 5, 2021, the applicant may choose either subsection (4)b.1. Runoff reduction or subsection (4)b.2. Water quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after August 5, 2021, the applicant shall choose subsection (4)b.1. Runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent subsection (4)b.1. Runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then subsection (4)b.2. Water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 34-556, Bartow County may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(6)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
(7)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(8)
Trout stream protection. Trout stream protection shall be provided by controlling temperature for receiving waters with trout stream designation. In streams designated as primary trout waters by the wildlife resources division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures. In streams designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding two degrees Farenheit of natural stream temperatures.
(9)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(10)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by Bartow County, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system.

(3)
Suspension, revocation, or modification of permit. The department may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated, upon such conditions as the department may deem necessary, to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The minimum fine for a violation of this article shall be $500.00. Such fines may be sought in connection with an action for injunctive relief in superior court. All persons involved in the violation, including landowners, developers, responsible parties, and persons actually conducting the activity, may be cited with violations of this article.

It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
