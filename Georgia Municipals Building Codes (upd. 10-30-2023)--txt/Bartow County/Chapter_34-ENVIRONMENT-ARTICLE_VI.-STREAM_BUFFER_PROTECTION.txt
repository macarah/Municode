The procedure for granting the variance shall be the procedure required in the Bartow County Development Regulations.
(3)
Variance standards. Variances will be granted only in if the board of appeals finds the following:
a.
The property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted; and
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be granted when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(4)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(5)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
(6)
An approved variance shall allow a reduction in buffer width only to the extent necessary to provide relief from the conditions which prevented land development activities on the parcel.
