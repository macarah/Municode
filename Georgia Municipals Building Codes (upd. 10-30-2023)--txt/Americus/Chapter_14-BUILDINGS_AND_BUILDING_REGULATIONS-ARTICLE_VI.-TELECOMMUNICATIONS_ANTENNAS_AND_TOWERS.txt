(Code 1986, § 5-252; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 2, 8-19-1999)
Sec. 14-232. - General guidelines and requirements.
(a)
Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to:
(1)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(2)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
(5)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
(b)
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(c)
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the community development department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The community development department may share such information with other applicants applying for special exception approval under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the community development department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
(d)
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection (d) shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the planning commission may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby.
(1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, are painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the planning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(e)
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
(f)
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the planning commission concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
(Code 1986, § 5-253; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 3, 8-19-1999)
Sec. 14-233. - Permitted uses.
(a)
Generally. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses and shall not require a special exception permit. Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply with section 14-232(d), (e), and (f) and all other applicable ordinances.
(b)
Specific permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted in any industrial and agricultural zoning district:
(1)
Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any existing off-site residence a distance of not less than 500 feet;
(2)
Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower, such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure, that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure; and
(3)
Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower and said existing tower is not a preexisting tower; provided, however, that such specific permitted use shall not include the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna.
(Code 1986, § 5-254; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 4, 8-19-1999)

(Code 1986, § 5-255; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 4, 8-19-1999)
Sec. 14-235. - Special exception permits.
(a)
Generally. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special exception permits:
(1)
If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section 14-233, then a special exception permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
(2)
In granting a special exception permit, the planning commission may impose conditions to the extent that they conclude such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.
(3)
Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer.
(b)
Information required. Each applicant requesting a special exception permit under this article shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professional engineers, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the planning commission to be necessary to assess compliance with this article.
(c)
Factors considered in granting special exception permits. The planning commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special exception permit, although they may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if they conclude that the goals of this article are better served thereby:
(1)
Height of the proposed tower;
(2)
Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries;
(3)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Surrounding topography;
(5)
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6)
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
(7)
Proposed ingress and egress; and
(8)
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection (d) of this section.
(d)
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning commission that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
(1)
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(2)
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5)
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(6)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(e)
Setback and separation requirements. The following setback and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special exception permit is required; provided, however, that the planning commission may reduce the standard setback and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1)
Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
(2)
Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
(3)
In zoning districts other than industrial or agricultural zoning districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height.
(f)
Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the city may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
(g)
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special exception permit is required; provided, however, that the planning commission may waive such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1)
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall comply with buffer requirements as noted in section 94-194(a)(2).
(2)
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
(3)
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
(Code 1986, § 5-256; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 6, 8-19-1999)
Sec. 14-236. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the city may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(Code 1986, § 5-257; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 5, 8-19-1999)
Sec. 14-237. - Variances.
(a)
Where a person or entity which desires to construct a telecommunications antenna or tower pursuant to this article can show that a provision of this article would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, or where, because of conditions peculiar to the site, or other unusual circumstances beyond the control of such person or entity, in the opinion of the planning commission, a departure from strict adherence to this article may be made without violating the intent of this article, the planning commission may, in its sole discretion, authorize a variance. Any such variance request shall be submitted in writing to the planning commission, and the minutes of the planning commission shall reflect the action taken by the planning commission as to such variance request, and such minutes shall also include the reason or reasons for granting such variance request.
(b)
With respect to the variance request authorized in subsection (a) of this section, the right to submit such a variance request shall be waived unless the request is submitted to the planning commission at the time the antenna permit is requested, or at the time the request for a special exception pursuant to section 14-234 is submitted.
(c)
The decision of the planning commission as to the approval or disapproval of variances requested under this article shall be final and not subject to appeal.
