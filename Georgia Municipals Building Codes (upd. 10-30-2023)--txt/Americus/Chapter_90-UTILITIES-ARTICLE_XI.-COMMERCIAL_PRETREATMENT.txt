A repair shall be inspected by the city to determine compliance with construction permit standards prior to final covering of the system. If the system constructed is approved by the city, an "inspection approval" notice will be given to the installer. If the system installation does not pass the construction inspection, then the installer shall make all required corrections and notify the city within seven days for a re-inspection of the system. A re-inspection fee shall be charged to the installer for additional inspection(s) if the contractor has failed to correct the items an inspector has required at the preliminary inspection. Final installation approval shall not be granted until the city has confirmed that the installation is in compliance with plans and specifications submitted with the permit application. If no final construction inspection can be documented of the commercial waste generators pretreatment system, then the certificate of occupancy on the project will not be released by the building inspector.
(b)
Existing pretreatment systems. The city will perform an annual inspection of all pretreatment systems permitted to operate in the city. The inspections will be conducted to make sure the commercial waste generator is following the maintenance criteria set forth in this article and the waste generator is operating under the conditions of the permit. Those facilities found in noncompliance will be required to correct all violations within seven days of notification. However, if the violation requires a repair, replacement or installation of a pretreatment system, then the commercial waste generator will have 15 days to comply. All repairs, replacement and installations will require approval by the city.

(1)
All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well as the current plumbing code used by the city.
(2)
For the sizing of pretreatment systems by specific generators source the following calculations are required to be submitted by a licensed engineer or master plumber:
a.
Restaurant facilities:
(S) × (GS) × HR / 12 × (LF) = Grease Interceptor capacity in gallons
S = Number of seats in dining area
GS = Gallons of wastewater per seat (use 15 gallons per seat)*
HR = Number of hours open
LR = Loading factor —
1.25 Interstate freeways
1.0 Other freeways
1.0 Recreational areas
Example: Restaurant with 100 seats open 12 hours a day next to a recreational facility.
(100) × (15) × 12 / 12 × (1.0) = 1,500 gal. capacity
b.
Hospitals, nursing homes, schools and other commercial kitchens with varied seating capacity:
(M) × (GM) × (LF) × (SC) } = Grease interceptor capacity in gallons / 1500
M = Meals per day
GM = Gallons of wastewater per seat (use 5 gallons per meal)
LF = Loading factor:
1.0 with dishwashing
0.5 without dishwashing
SC = storage capacity factor:
1.0 for Public sewer
2.5 for on-site septic disposal
Example: School facility w/252 cafeteria seat capacity
(3) meals served per/day 3(252) = 756
(756) × (5) × (1.0) = 3780 / 1,500 = 2.52
(Number of Interceptors)
(3) 1,500 grease interceptors needed
Nursing home w/120 beds, meals served per/day varies
(120) × (5) × (1.0) = 1,500 / 1,500 = 1
(1) 1500 grease interceptor needed
c.
Commercial car/truck wash facility, gas stations w/carwashes: (without reclaim system)
(HR) × (C/HR) × (GAL USED/C) = GAL/DAY Minus (-)
(HR) × (C/HR) × (GAL LOST/C) = GAL/DAY } = Oil Interceptor capacity / 1,500
= Oil interceptor capacity (gallons)
HR = Hours of Operation
C/HR = Cars per Hour
GAL/USED = Gallons of Wastewater Used per Car
(Based on system design specifications)
GAL/LOST = Gallons of Wastewater Lost per Car
(Based on system design specifications)
Example: Carwash is open 12 hours. System can wash 10 cars per hour. System uses 35 gallons of wastewater per car, but loses 8 gallons of wastewater per car.
(12) × (10) × (35) = 4200 Used gal. wastewater/day
(12) × (10) × (8) = -960 Lost gal. wastewater/day
3240 Gallons Capacity
3,240 / 1,500 = (2) oil interceptors needed for carwash area
Example: Carwash Calculation reclaimed water:
Average hours of operation = 12.5 13 hours
EXPAND
Mon—Sat = 15 Hrs
Sun = 10 Hrs
25 Hrs>
  EXPAND
Number of cars washed daily 250 Cars
Number of Cars washed hourly (250) / 13  = 19 Cars
Gallons of wastewater used per car 35 gallons
Gallons of wastewater reclaimed per car 30 gallons
(13) × (19) × (35) = 8,645 used gal wastewater/day
(13) × (19) × (30) - (minus) = 7,410 reclaimed wastewater/day
1,235 gallons of wastewater backwashed to sewer>
1/1500 gallon oil separator required for collection of backwash to sewer
(2) 3,000 gallon tanks used for reclaim system ( 7410/3000 = 2.47).
  d.
Determine seating capacity to calculate grease interceptor size:
AREA / 15 = Approximate seating capacity
(S) = AREA / 15 - Square footage of designated food space - Factor to be used to calculate seating capacity
(S) × (GM) × (2.5) × (LF) = Grease Interceptor capacity in gallons.
Example: A grocery store is 69,000 sq.ft. An area of 4,000 sq. ft., is designated for their food court area.
4,000 / 15 = 266.6 (267) Seating Capacity
(267) × (5) × (2.5) × (1.0) = 3,338 / 1,500 = 2.2
(2) 1,500 grease interceptors needed
Grocery stores will have a minimum (1) 1,500 grease trap. If additional eating facilities will be located in store similar to a food court area, store will be sized based on square footage of food area and seating capacity. Individual restaurants may be required to install pretreatment for their space.
(3)
Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be:
a.
Inadequate for the facility's current operation.
b.
In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals an upgrade or repair is required.
c.
Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the city or clean-up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair.
d.
Installed incorrectly and not per plumbing code used by the city or engineering standards. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced.
(4)
Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system. The concrete lid of tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled.
(5)
Any 3,000-gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two sections provided the center section has been sealed properly where no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be 3,000 gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All 3,000-gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or its equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two sections on tanks less than 1,500 gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as a baffle wall. A three-inch to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two feet from the bottom of the tank.
(6)
A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system.
(7)
Subsurface pretreatment systems installed must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification (or certification approved by the public works department) and the gallon (GMP) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify type and size of tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed.
(8)
All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two feet. The brick work will be three feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once 80 percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, you must corbel in the brickwork in small increments.
(9)
An alternative interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the city. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the city for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required.
