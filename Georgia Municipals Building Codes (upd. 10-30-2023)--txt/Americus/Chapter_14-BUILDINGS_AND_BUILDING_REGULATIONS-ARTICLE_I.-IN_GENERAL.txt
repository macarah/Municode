Sec. 14-2. - Stormwater management.
(a)
Plans required. Stormwater management plans shall be required for a development before any building permits may be issued. Those developments include:
(1)
Any commercial, industrial, school, church or places of religious worship, recreational facilities, and private clubs and golf courses, where the development will disturb or alter more than 1.1 acres of land area.
(2)
Any subdivision, multifamily, or group housing development where at least ten dwelling units are proposed.
(3)
Any other development where the building official with consultation with the utilities director deems appropriate because of location, terrain, grade, or any other possible stormwater problem.
(b)
Application procedure. Two copies of the stormwater management plans shall be submitted to the building risk management office. These plans shall bear the signature/seal of a registered or certified professional in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying, or erosion and sedimentation control. The building official will forward one copy to the city utilities director for review and approval, and the other copy shall be retained in the project construction files within the building official's office. The utilities director will notify the building official of approval or disapproval of the stormwater management plans as designed within seven working days.
(c)
Standards for stormwater management.
(1)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required when the proposed development shall increase the peak rate of runoff by more than one percent for a 25-year frequency storm;

Should the peak rate of stormwater runoff from the site exceed the permitted peak release rate, then on-site retention or detention shall be required. All retention or detention facilities shall be designed for all intensities up to and including 25-year frequency for all duration of rainfall. The peak runoff rate from the site after the development shall not be greater than the permitted peak release rate; and

The retention or detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall, as published by the National Weather Service for the affected site. The retention or detention volume required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of the 25-year rainfall for any and all durations from the proposed development, less than that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate as specified in subsection (c)(1) of this section.
(d)

Any plan variation noted by the utilities director shall be addressed in writing to the developer of the site or contractor in charge and a copy sent to the city building official for filing with the project documents.
