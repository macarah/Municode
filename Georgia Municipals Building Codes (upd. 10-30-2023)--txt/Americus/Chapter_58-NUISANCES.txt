(1)
That the city utilities director, or his designee, shall undertake, on a continuing basis, to locate, examine, and inventory all junked vehicles within the city. Such inventory shall be kept and maintained by the utilities director in his office and at such other location or locations as may be directed by the governing body of the city.
(2)
With respect to any junked motor vehicle located upon the premises of a single-family or two-family residence, the utilities director shall determine the ownership of such motor vehicle, and such ownership shall be included in the inventory referred to above.
(3)
The owner of the junked motor vehicle shall be contacted by the utilities director, or his designee, who shall be authorized to purchase the junked motor vehicle from the owner thereof in consideration of a $200.00 credit against the owner's city utility services bill.
(4)
No such credit shall be provided until ownership of the junked motor vehicle is transferred to the city by certificate of title transfer or by bill of sale in the event that the junked motor vehicle is too old to require a certificate of title transfer. Any written transfer of a junked motor vehicle shall include, as part of the terms thereof, authority from the owner of the premises where the junked motor vehicle is located authorizing the city or its designee, to come upon the property where such junked motor vehicle is located and remove the junked motor vehicle by such means as may be deemed necessary by the city or its designee.

Upon acquisition of the ownership of the junked motor vehicle, the utilities director shall be authorized to sell the junked motor vehicle to a recycling company determined by the utilities director to offer the most advantageous terms (financial and otherwise) to the city with respect to such purchase or purchases. Any sale to a recycling company may be made on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis or with respect to the sale of a group of vehicles. No public bidding shall be required for such sale.
(6)
In the event that the utilities director is required to hire a tow truck company or companies to remove the junked motor vehicles from the premises where they are located, the utilities director shall be authorized to bid out such tow truck services on an annual basis, with the tow truck service being awarded to the lowest responsible bidder or bidders as determined by the utilities director. The utilities director shall also have the authority to terminate any such agreement with a tow truck service at any time due to the failure of the tow truck service to provide such service in a manner acceptable to the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the utilities director from awarding such bid to more than one tow truck service at a time and to use such tow truck services on a rotating basis as established by the utilities director if such procedure is determined to be in the best interest of the city.
(b)
The city manager of the city, or her designee, shall be authorized to adopt further rules and regulations to implement and carry out the purposes and intent of this section.
