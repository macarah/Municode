PART 2 - PRODUCTS

2.1 - MATERIALS
A.
Base: The base shall conform to Section 310, Graded Aggregate Construction, of the Standard Specifications.
B.
Prime: The prime coat shall be RC-70 and shall conform to Section 412, Bituminous Prime, of the Standard Specifications.
C.
Tack Coat: The tack coat shall be asphaltic cement (grade to be determined by engineer) and shall conform to Section 413, Bituminous Tack Coat, of the Standard Specifications.
D.
Intermediate Course (Binder): The intermediate course shall be Type B Asphalt Concrete and shall conform to Section 400, Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction of the Standard Specifications.
E.
Surface Course - Asphalt Plant Mix: The surface course shall be type F asphaltic concrete, Group 1 or 2, 135 lb/sy and shall conform to Section 400 of the Standard Specifications.
F.
Paint: Paint for pavement marking shall be Traffic Line Paint and shall conform to Section 870, Paint, of the Standard Specifications.
G.
Concrete Curb and Gutter: Shall conform to Section 441 - Concrete Curb, Gutter, Combination Curb and Gutter, Header and Median of the Standard Specifications.
PART 3 - EXECUTION

3.1 - COMPACTION
A.
Subgrade: The upper 12 inches of subgrade soils in all cut areas and all fill areas that are to receive new pavements shall be scarified and recompacted until a density equivalent to 98% Modified Proctor maximum dry density in accordance with ASTM D698 has been obtained.
B.
Base: All base shall have minimum compaction of 100% of the maximum density obtained by the test procedure present in ASTM D1557, Method D (Modified Proctor). The maximum permissible lift thickness shall be 6 inches (compacted).
C.
Moisture Content: Compaction shall be performed only when the moisture content of the soil is within 4% of the optimum moisture content at the time of compaction as determined by ASTM D698. Soils are to be dried prior to compaction by disking and aeration. An Independent Testing Laboratory shall determine if soils are within the optimum moisture content.
3.2 - CONSTRUCTION
A.
Preparation of Subgrade: Prior to placing of base and pavements, the construction of all utility lines (water, sewer, power, gas, etc.) which are to be placed under the pavements shall have been completed.
B.
Base: The base course shall be constructed in accordance with Section 310 of the Standard Specifications to the compacted thickness specified (6" minimum).
C.
Prime: The prime coat shall be applied at a rate of 0.25 gallons per square yard and in accordance with Section 412 of the Standard Specifications.
D.
Tack Coat: The tack coat shall be applied at a rate of 0.10 gallons per square yard and in accordance with Section 413 of the Standard Specifications.
E.
Intermediate and Surface Course - Asphalt Plant Mix: The intermediate and surface courses shall be constructed in accordance with Section 400 of the Standard Specifications to the thickness indicated. All thicknesses are compacted.
F.
Painting Centerline Stripe: Contractor shall paint a 4 inch wide broken yellow paint stripe in the center of all new streets. Broken centerline shall consist of painted segments of 15 feet long with 25 foot unpainted gaps between painted segments per DOT standards for traffic control.
G.
Existing pavement that has pavement markings damaged by this construction shall be repainted.
H.
Concrete Curb and Gutter: Shall be constructed in accordance with Section 441 of the Standard Specification.
3.3 - TESTING THICKNESS
The City, at the Contractor's expense, shall require as many tests as necessary to determine the average thickness of the base course prior to the placing of the intermediate course. The average thickness of all specimens shall be at least the specified thickness of the base course. In areas where there is a deficiency in the thickness of the base course the intermediate course shall be increased in thickness the amount of the average deficiency of all tests. The intermediate course shall be tested and any deficiency shall be made up in the surface course. If tests show a deficiency of one fourth in the surface course, the Contractor shall be required to place an additional surface course of one inch in thickness.
3.4 - EXISTING PAVEMENT RESTORATION
A.
Pavement damaged due to construction shall be patched or replaced as directed by the City Engineer.
B.
Pavement damaged by new utility trenches shall be restored as follows:
1.
Concrete Pavement Replacement
a.
Existing pavement shall be removed to a minimum of 12 inches on either side of the trench.
b.
Granular base material shall be placed to a minimum depth of 6 inches and compacted to 100% maximum dry density following trench backfilling and compaction.
c.
Depth of concrete pavement replaced shall match the existing pavement or shall be a minimum of 6 inches thick whichever is greater.
d.
Concrete paving slab shall be reinforced with No. 4 bars spaced 12 inches on center each way. Minimum clear distance from the bottom of the slab to the reinforcing steel shall be 2 inches.
e.
Joints and finish of the slab shall match existing pavement.
2.
Asphalt Pavement Replacement
a.
Existing pavement shall be removed to a minimum of 12 inches on either side of the trench.
b.
Granular base material shall be placed to a minimum depth of 6 inches and compacted to 100% maximum dry density following trench backfilling and compaction.
c.
A 5-inch asphalt surface shall be laid after a tack coat is applied to the bottom and the sides of the area to be patched. The tack coat shall be applied at the rate of 0.10 gallon per square foot and can be either sprayed or brushed on. The patch shall be rolled in both directions with a 5-ton roller.
d.
Joints and finish shall match existing pavement.
3.
Maintenance of Surface
a.
Pavement damage due to settlement of backfill: Repair for a period of one year.
