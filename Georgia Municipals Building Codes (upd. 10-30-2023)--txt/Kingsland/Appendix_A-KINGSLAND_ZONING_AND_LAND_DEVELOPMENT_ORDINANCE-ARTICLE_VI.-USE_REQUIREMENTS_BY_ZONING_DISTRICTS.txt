This will be accomplished through evaluation of proposed developments within this overlay district by the Planning Commission (PC), which shall review the location, character and appearance of new developments in a positive manner. It is the purpose of such review to determine, in a cooperative fashion with the applicant, whether the proposed plan meets the guidelines and other standards of this overlay district.
65.1 Delineation of Parkway Overlay District. The Laurel Island Parkway Overlay District shall include all lands within 500 feet of each side of the center line of the following road rights-of-way:
Laurel Island Parkway—from Coleraine Road to County Road 78, but not including any C-4 zoned property within 1,000 feet of an I-95 ramp.
The approximate boundary of this overlay district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map and shall be shown as a surveyed line by the applicant on each property subject to PC review.
65.2 Affected Development/Review by the Planning Commission. All development plan applications for development located in the Laurel Island Parkway Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. This includes all proposed commercial, residential, recreational or other type development. All changes subject to approval by the Commission shall receive such approval before proceeding. The Commission may also review preliminary development plans or design development drawings at the request of the Mayor and City Council or the applicant so that major redesign or final plan by the applicant shall not be necessary.
65.3 Development Activity Permitted Within the District.
1) There shall be no alteration of the existing condition of the lands, uses or structures within the Laurel Island Parkway Overlay District from the date of enactment of this section henceforth except as provided for by this section or by other sections of this Ordinance.
65.4 Minimum Visual Buffer Standards.
1) Retention of and/or creation of a Minimum Visual Buffer along the Corridor right-of-way:
(a) Each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the right-of-way line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas. The purpose of the Minimum Visual Buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots from the road, to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site, and to lessen spillover light from on site lighting. The buffer shall be continuous, except as set forth in (b) below, and be no less than twenty feet (20') average and fifteen feet (15) minimum depth across the frontage of the property, such buffer being measured from the existing right-of-way line, or from the new right-of-way line should the application under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of an easement for proposed roadway purposes. The fifteen foot (15') minimum depth shall not occur at the high activity areas of a project. These areas include but are not limited to: building entrances, drop-offs and drive-throughs.
To determine the average depth of the Minimum Visual Buffer, measurements shall be taken at intervals not greater than 10 feet and perpendicular to the property line. Side buffer areas required by other sections of this Ordinance, and deep, narrow land areas, shall not be used when calculating the Minimum Visual Buffer. Where lagoons and drainage swales occupy a substantial portion of the Minimum Visual Buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns, additional buffer depth and/or vegetation may be required to achieve the visual softening requirement. If development is proposed for a platted lot which is part of a previously approved subdivision, and the size of the lot or the existing common road or utility system of the subdivision make strict adherence to these standards impractical, the Commission may relax the above standards for the buffer at lagoons and drainage swales as reasonably necessary to permit development which is otherwise consistent with the Land Development Ordinance.
(b) The intent of the Minimum Visual Buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect. This buffer may be enhanced or created, where such vegetation is insufficient or nonexistent, with trees and shrubs of a variety and species appropriate to the City's character. If the Minimum Visual Buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted in Section 140.6 of the Land Development Ordinance, their preservation is required. Where masses of native shrubs are present, their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged. While complete screening of a project is not required, sufficient plant material shall be retained and/or installed to accomplish the softening effect required in (1) above. In order to maintain the screening effect, existing vegetation shall not be limbed-up from the ground more than five feet (5') to the lowest branches, provided that additional height may be permitted at intersections to achieve the sight standard as needed for appropriate vision clearance. However, if understory planting is planned, existing vegetation may, with the approval of the staff, be limbed-up to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plans. Minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with the provisions of the Landscape section of the Land Development Ordinance. Minimum height of new shrubs used to create the Minimum Visual Buffer shall be three feet (3') at installation.
65.5 Permitted Activity in Minimum Visual Buffer Before and After Development. Within the Minimum Visual Buffer there shall be no development, clearing, grading or construction activity with the following exceptions:
(a) Roadway and/or access to the portion of the site not in the Minimum Visual Buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way.
(b) Provision for water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable, etc., service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way. In the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road right-of-way, an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation removal. Permission for easement and right-of-way disturbance and clearings for such services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes.
(c) Pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road corridor, provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer.
(d) Lighting fixtures which comply with the appropriate sections of this Ordinance for approved signs only or if, for safety reasons, they cannot be placed outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and necessary easements can be established and constructed without significantly reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer.
(e) Signs in accordance with the sign regulations delineated herein.
(f) Clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exists to any development as needed to provide for reasonable traffic safety, in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices of the State of Georgia and the City of Kingsland.
(g) The addition of plantings, earth forms or other visual buffers which, in the opinion of the Commission, would better achieve the purpose set out in subsection (a) than would otherwise be the case.
(h) Large work area doors or open bays shall be constructed in such a manner that the structure will not directly face Laurel Island Parkway. Screening of these doors should be incorporated with the construction plans for any doors facing other road rights-of-way.
(i) Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment, cut work, air compressors, and other fixed operating machinery shall be either screened from view or located so that such items are not visible from the highway. Trash receptacles, dumpsters, utility meters, above-ground tanks, etc., shall be similarly treated.
(j) No temporary structures are permitted except those in conjunction with and during construction projects.
(k) Large unbroken parking and drive areas exceeding five thousand (5,000) square feet are not permitted. Separation strips and parking islands shall be used and contain natural or planted trees and shrubs.
(l) The number of parking spaces shall be as required in the Zoning and Land Development Ordinance. There shall be a maximum of eight (8) spaces in a single row with a nine (9) foot by eighteen (18) foot island separating each eight or fewer space groups. The retention of original trees is encouraged in the islands.
(m) Parking Lot Islands. When islands are required in parking lots, each island shall include (a) shade tree not less than ten (10) feet in height. The preservation of existing trees in parking islands is encouraged.
