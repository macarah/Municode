PART 2 - EXECUTION

2.1 - METHODS OF INSTALLATION
A.
Boring or jacking shall be in accordance with AREA 1-4-19 and 1-5, DOT Specification 615 as follows:
1.
Bored or jacked installation, approved by the Railroad or DOT Engineer, shall have a bored hole diameter essentially the same as the outside diameter of the encasing pipe plus the protective coating thickness. If the bored hole diameter is greater than the outside diameter of the pipe, including the thickness of the coating by more than 1 inch, or if voids should develop during the operation and are determined to be detrimental to the work then the voids shall be pressure grouted with an approved mix.
2.
The carrier pipe shall be as shown on the plans and approved by the City Engineer. If the carrier pipe is steel without casing then the pipe shall be designed to the maximum continuous length possible, thickness and size according to the application needed. The aforementioned steel shall comply with ASSA C 200 and shall be lined and coated in accordance with AWWA C203, subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Adapters shall be provided between steel pipe and pipe of other materials.
3.
All casing pipe shall be steel, fully bituminous coated in accordance with AREA 1-4-13. Metal thickness shall be as follows:
MINIMUM WALL THICKNESS FOR STEEL CASING PIPE
EXPAND
Nominal Thickness (Inches) Nominal Diameter (Inches)
0.250 18 and under
0.281 20
0.312 22
0.344 24
0.375 26
0.406 28 and 30
0.438 32
0.469 34 and 36
0.500 38, 40 and 42
  4.
Steel casing pipe shall conform to AWWA C200. Steel casing pipe shall be of maximum length possible for the applications intended and shall be welded in conformance with AWWA Specification C 206. Steel casing pipe shall be at least 2 inches greater than the largest outside diameter of the carrier pipe including bells, lugs, etc., for carrier pipe less than 6 inches in diameter; and at least 4 inches greater for carrier pipe 6 inches and over in diameter.
5.
Casing pipe shall be jacked or bored in place with allowances made for lines and gradients of the carrier pipes. After the casing pipe is installed, the carrier pipe shall be installed within it to the exact line and gradient with an approved casing spacer. All joints shall be restrained within the casing pipe as well as the first joint outside of the casing pipe on either end.
6.
When the carrier pipe has been installed and securely anchored inside the casing pipe, the ends of the casing shall be plugged with a masonry plug.
7.
Construction effort shall not cease when such cessation might tend to harm the total crossing effort. Protective measures shall be taken to protect the railroad and highway as well as the crossing pipe. Pipe work and tunnels shall be protected at the end of each working day against the weather and any other danger.
B.
Tunneling
1.
Tunneling will not be allowed unless extreme circumstances exist that will not allow other means of crossing.
2.
The Contractor must apply for permit to the railroad or DOT and obtain approval from the City of Kingsland.
