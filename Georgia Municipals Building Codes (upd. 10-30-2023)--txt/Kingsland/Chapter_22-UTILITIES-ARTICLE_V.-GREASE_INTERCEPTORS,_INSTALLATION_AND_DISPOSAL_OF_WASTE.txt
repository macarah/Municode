The written request shall include the reasons for the grease generator's failure or inability to comply with the compliance date set forth, the additional time needed to complete the remaining work, and the steps to be taken to avoid future delays. The authority having jurisdiction shall determine the date for compliance.
(Ord. No. 2004-04, ยง 5, 3-22-2004)
Sec. 22-136. - Discharge criteria.
The following prohibitions shall apply:
(a)
Where oil and grease are a byproduct of food preparation and/or cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be made to separate waste oil and grease into a separate container for proper disposal. Except as contained in byproducts of food preparation and/or clean up, waste oil and grease shall not be discharged to any drains or grease interceptors. Such waste shall be placed in a container designed to hold such waste and either utilized by industry or disposed of at suitable locations.
(b)
None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease interceptor, or into any drain that leads to the interceptor:
1)
Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes, degreasers, or any type of product that will liquefy grease interceptor wastes,
2)
Any substance that may cause excessive foaming in the POTW, or
3)
Any substance capable of passing the solid or semi-solid contents of the grease interceptor to the POTW.
(c)
The influent to interceptors shall not exceed 140 degrees Fahrenheit (140ยฐ F). The temperature at the flow control device inspection port shall be considered equivalent to the temperature of the influent.
(d)
Toilets, urinals, and other similar fixtures shall not discharge through a grease interceptor.
(e)
All waste shall only enter the grease interceptor through the inlet flow control device, then the inlet pipe.
(f)
Where food-waste grinders are installed, the waste from those units shall discharge directly into the building drainage system without passing through a grease interceptor. Living quarters, as defined in this ordinance, are exempted from this requirement.
(Ord. No. 2004-04, ยง 6, 3-22-2004)
Sec. 22-137. - Requirements for grease interceptors.
(a)
All commercial and industrial facilities dealing with grease shall, at the permittees' expense and as required by the authority having jurisdiction:
(1)
Provide an adequately sized grease interceptor. Requirements for grease trap sizing and the design criteria are provided in subsection (b).
(2)
Locate the interceptor in a manner that provides ready and easy accessibility for cleaning and inspection.
(3)
Obtain a written interceptor service agreement with a licensed transporter for a term of at least one year, or for the duration of the operation of the establishment, whichever is less, to maintain the interceptor in effective operating condition. A service agreement must be in effect as long as the facility has a grease trap permit.
(4)
Unless otherwise specified by the authority having jurisdiction, service the interceptor every 30 days and maintain backup copies of trip tickets and a service log, on the premises of the facility, for at least three years.
(5)
Report to the authority having jurisdiction monthly as defined in section 22-143.
(6)
Allow demand inspection of the facility and of records by inspectors during reasonable hours.
(b)
Requirements for grease trap sizing and design criteria.
(1)
Introduction: Information contained within this document is based on standard industry practices and guidance found in both, the 2003 International Plumbing Code (IPC) Commentary, or latest edition, and the 2000 Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC), or latest edition, Appendix H. Size, type, and location of grease traps shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and the requirements of the City of Kingsland Code of Ordinances.
(2)
Applicability: These requirements are applicable to all commercial food service establishments, including those that are undergoing:
a.
New construction.
b.
Interior remodeling to accommodate expansion or operational modifications.
c.
Changes of ownership/occupancy.
d.
Facilities, which may be experiencing difficulty in achieving compliance with maintenance and/or wastewater discharge limitations.
(3)
Sizing requirements: Sizing methods described herein are intended as guidance in determining grease trap/interceptor sizes that will afford the city's sanitary sewer system (POTW) a minimum degree of protection against grease and other obstructing materials. Sizing determinations are based on operational data provided by business owners or their contractors. In approving a customer's plumbing or grease interceptor design, the city does not accept liability for the failure of a system to adequately treat wastewater to achieve effluent quality requirements specified under this article. It is the responsibility of the generator and/or contractors to insure the appropriate level of treatment necessary for compliance with environmental and wastewater regulations.
Minimum acceptable grease trap/interceptor sizing shall be accomplished as follows:
a.
Sizing according to formulas found in subsection (b)(4) below.
b.
Where sizing formulas result in determination of a grease trap less than 1,000 gallons in capacity, this minimum size is recommended. However, under no circumstances should exterior grease traps less than 1,000 gallons be utilized.
c.
In the circumstance of "single service kitchens" with no food preparation (heat/serve only), and which use only paper service items, a minimum 50 gallon per minute (gpm) flow rated, or 100 pound grease retention, mechanical grease trap may be used. In these instances, the grease trap is to be installed in an area separate from food handling area, and the trap must be readily accessible for cleaning and maintenance. (See subsection 22-137(b)(6), below)
(4)
Grease trap sizing formulas: It is the responsibility of the generator and his/her contractors to ensure that the wastewater discharged from their facility is in compliance with the city's discharge limitations. For the purpose of plans review, a general assessment of grease trap/interceptor design and size will be performed using the following formulas. (These formulas have been demonstrated as industry standards capable of achieving the city's discharge criteria when systems are maintained in proper conditions.)
Method 1: Uniform Plumbing Code, Appendix H
Number of meals x waste flow x retention x storage = Size Requirement
Per Peak hour (1) rate (2) time (3) factor (4) (liquid capacity)
Factors:
(1)
Number of meals served at peak operating hour (seating capacity) x peak factor
a.
Where peak factor for fast food restaurant is .....1.33
b.
And, peak factor for all other food service types is .....1.00
(2)
Waste flow rate:
a.
With dishwasher .....6 gallon flow
b.
Without dishwasher .....5 gallon flow
c.
Single service kitchen .....2 gallon flow
d.
Food waste disposer .....1 gallon flow
(3)
Retention times:
a.
Commercial kitchen waste/dishwasher .....2.5 hours
b.
Single service kitchen/single serving .....1.5 hours
(4)
Storage factors:
a.
Fully equipped commercial kitchen .....
8 hr operation .....= 1
b.
16 hr operation .....= 2
c.
24 hr operation .....= 3
d.
Single service kitchen .....= 1.5
The Uniform Plumbing Code includes a built-in safety factor that can yield very large grease trap size specifications. At this time, the city is not requiring traps larger than 4,000 gallons. However, the decision to use a trap smaller than that specified by the formula and calculations above is to be addressed in the plan submission.
Method 2: Five (5) hour detention/peak flow
A.โGallons of water used per hour of operation
B.โA x 0.75 = average "gray water" flow per hour
C.โB x 1.9 peak flow factor
D.โC x 5 hours detention = volume trap
Required volume of trap = A x B x C x D
(5)
Alternate sizing formulas/proposals. Facilities that propose the use of alternate sizing techniques and/or procedures that result in specifications that differ from calculated requirements (or are less than the MINIMUM 1,000 gallon recommendation), must submit formulas and other bases to support proposed grease trap size/installation. Submission should also provide documentation of ability to meet effluent quality requirements. This proposal must be signed by a licensed plumbing contractor or engineer licensed in the State of Georgia.
(6)
Construction/installation: All permitting, construction, and inspection activities must be completed in accordance with the Kingsland Land Development Ordinance. Additionally, the following specifications must be incorporated into grease trap design.
a.
The grease interceptor shall be constructed with a minimum of two chambers or shall have a minimum of two tanks in series. If two chambered, the dividing wall must extend to within one foot of the bottom of the tank and within two inches of the top and be securely fastened to both sides.
b.
There must be inlet and outlet tees made of schedule 40 PVC installed. The inlet tee should extend down approximately one-third the depth of the trap from the top and the outlet tee should be located 12 to 18 inches off of the bottom of the trap.
c.
Grease traps are to be installed at a minimum distance of ten feet from sinks and dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of wastewater. Water temperatures must be less than 140ยฐF. prior to entering grease trap.
d.
All grease bearing waste streams should be routed through an appropriate grease trap/interceptor, including: three-compartment sinks, pot/pan sinks, soup kettles, hand-washing sinks, dishwashers, mop sinks and floor drains.
Notable exceptions: Drains that receive "clear waste" only, such as from ice machines, condensate from coils and drink stations, may be plumbed to the sanitary system without passing through the grease interceptor with the condition that the receiving drain is a "hub" type that is a minimum of two inches above the finished floor.
e.
All exterior or recessed grease traps and interceptors are to be installed with an effluent sampling well, equivalent to: a. Parks Equipment Services Sample Well SWB-9; b. American Industrial Pre-Cast Products Test Well; or c. Uopnor Sample Well. Sample wells will have a 15" diameter access cover and a minimum four inch drop from inlet to outlet piping through the sampling well. Mechanical grease traps and Interceptors that are installed above ground must be equipped with an influent flow regulator and an effluent valve assembly that allows for sample collection.
(7)
Customer (generator) responsibilities: It is the responsibility of the customer (waste generator) to insure compliance with the city discharge limitations.
Hazardous wastes, such as acids, strong cleaners, pesticides, herbicides, paint, solvents, or gasoline should not be disposed of where they would go through grease or grit traps. If commercial dishwashers are discharged through a grease interceptor, care must be taken in system design. Dishwashers use detergents and elevated water temperatures that will melt grease. If the interceptor is either too small or too close to the commercial dishwasher, grease may pass through the interceptor and into the collection system.
Generators are responsible for maintaining grease traps in continuous proper working condition. Further, generators are responsible for inspecting, repairing, replacing, or installing apparatus and equipment as necessary to ensure proper operation and function of grease traps and compliance with discharge limitations at all times.
The generator must have a grease trap/grease interceptor service contract (for pumping, cleaning, and inspection) by a city permitted vacuum truck cleaning service/waste hauler, at a minimum frequency of every 30 days to ensure proper function. The trap shall be maintained more frequently if needed to meet the city's discharge criteria. Records of maintenance are required to be submitted to the city monthly for inspection and maintained on site for three years. (30-day maintenance frequency assumes proper sizing and installation consistent with this guidance).
Enzymes, solvents, and emulsifiers are not permitted, as they will only change the form of grease, allowing it to be carried out of the trap with the wastewater and deposited in the collection system (POTW). Biological treatment systems must be pre-approved by the authority having jurisdiction. These systems will not alleviate the necessity for inspection and proper maintenance.
(Ord. No. 2004-04, ยง 7, 3-22-2004; Ord. No. 2004-11, ยงยง 1, 2, 6-14-2004)
Sec. 22-138. - Grease interceptor construction.
(a)
Any person responsible for discharges requiring a grease interceptor shall, at his own expense and as required by the city, provide plans and specifications for equipment and facilities of a design type and design capacity approved by the inspection division of the department of community development of the city. The grease interceptor must be in compliance with the current applicable city plumbing codes. The person shall locate the interceptor in a manner that provides easy accessibility for cleaning and inspection and maintain the interceptor in effective operating condition. The inspection division of the department of community development shall inspect the interceptor during construction and upon completion. All interested parties, including the inspection division of the department of community development and the authority having jurisdiction shall make a final inspection before any service connections are made.
(b)
Construction of items listed herein in accordance herewith or in accordance to the city's specifications shall not constitute a defense to unlawful discharge and shall not limit the generator's liability for any surcharge stated in this division.
(c)
If the authority having jurisdiction determines that there is a need for installation or upgrading of sample ports or grease interceptors on an existing establishment, the authority having jurisdiction may order the installation or upgrading of such interceptors on that existing establishment. If the authority having jurisdiction orders such installation, then the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of such order upon the grease generator. Within ten days of receipt of such order, the grease generator may demand a hearing to review such order, in which case the authority having jurisdiction shall schedule a hearing to review such order within 30 days of receiving the demand for review from the grease or grit generator. If a hearing to review the order is scheduled, the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of the hearing to review such order upon the grease generator at least ten days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to review the order, the grease generator may present evidence, and the authority having jurisdiction may make new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the original hearing. After receiving notice of the order to install or upgrade ports or interceptors on an existing establishment, it shall be unlawful for a grease generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer not in compliance with such order.
(d)
Where the process wastewaters are generated in only part of the facility, the process wastewaters may, at the option of the authority having jurisdiction, discharge into a grease interceptor servicing only those areas that provide a suitable sampling port.
(e)
The authority having jurisdiction may waive the requirement for a grease interceptor provided the grease generator can verify that only domestic sewage is being discharged, with no floor drains or process water. The authority having jurisdiction may require testing by the user in connection with this request, with all costs for this testing being at the users expense.
(Ord. No. 2004-04, ยง 8, 3-22-2004)
Sec. 22-139. - Service/inspection ports and monitoring ports.
(a)
Except for "under the sink grease interceptors", each interceptor shall be located outside of a building or structure in an area accessible for service, and so installed and connected that it shall be at all times easily accessible for inspection, and for cleaning and removal of the intercepted waste. Inlet flow control inspection ports, interceptor inspection ports, and effluent monitoring ports shall be in areas where vehicles may not temporarily block access to inspection. The use of ladders or the removal of bulky equipment or stored materials in order to inspect inlet flow control devices, inspect or service interceptors, or sample interceptor effluent shall constitute a violation of accessibility. Inspection ports and monitoring ports shall be located so as to allow inspectors quick and easy access to the inlet flow control device, each compartment of the interceptor, and the effluent from the interceptor. An interceptor shall not be installed in any part of a building where food is handled. The location of all interceptors, inspection ports, and monitoring ports shall meet the approval of the authority having jurisdiction and shall be shown on the approved building plans.
(b)
An inspection port shall be provided for the flow control device regulating flow into the interceptor.
(c)
A one-piece removable metal plate covering the entire interceptor shall be preferred as an interceptor inspection port, though at the discretion of the authority having jurisdiction, standard manhole ports may be installed over each divider in the interceptor, but in either case all parts of the interceptor shall be easily accessible for cleaning and visual inspection.
(d)
A monitoring port shall be provided for ease in sampling the treated effluent from the interceptor and shall be as close as possible to the connection with the city POTW within the bounds of the facility property. The port shall be installed according to the specifications of the authority having jurisdiction. The port shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense. A generator shall properly place, monitor, and maintain the monitoring port so that wastewater samples taken from the monitoring port are representative of wastewater leaving the interceptor. It shall be unlawful for a grease generator to divert sewage around a monitoring point into the POTW.
(Ord. No. 2004-04, ยง 9, 3-22-2004)
Sec. 22-140. - Under the sink grease interceptors.

(b)
Required pumping frequency.
(1)
Unless otherwise specified by the authority having jurisdiction, each interceptor in active use shall be cleaned at least once every month or more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the POTW, unless it can be demonstrated to the authority having jurisdiction that the pumping frequency can be performed at greater intervals. The authority having jurisdiction may specify cleaning more frequently when monthly pumping is shown to be inadequate. Additional pumping may be required during time periods where increased loading is anticipated. Any grease generator desiring a schedule less frequent than monthly shall submit a request to the authority having jurisdiction along with testing (as required by the authority having jurisdiction) and copies of the cleaning records for the last four interceptor cleanings, including measurements of the thickness of the surface scum/grease layer.
(2)
At any time if an inspection finds the interceptor to be full, immediate steps shall be taken by the grease generator to pump out and clean it as soon as is practicable. The inspector shall make an evaluation of the advisability of allowing discharge to continue, and may at his or her discretion order an immediate cessation of all discharge from the facility. In any case, the wastewater discharge permit of the facility may be amended so as to compel more frequent pumping and cleaning of the interceptor.
(c)
All interceptors shall be maintained by the grease generator at the grease generator's expense.
(d)
Requirement for increased pumpage or servicing. If the authority having jurisdiction finds that a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor is necessary for an establishment to meet the discharge limits stated in this article, the authority having jurisdiction may order a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor. If the authority having jurisdiction orders a change in the pumpage or servicing, then the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of such order upon the generator. Within ten days of receipt of such order, the generator may demand a hearing to review such order, in which case the authority having jurisdiction shall schedule a hearing to review such order within 30 days of receiving the demand for review from the generator. If a hearing to review the order is scheduled, the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of the hearing to review such order at least ten days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to review the order, the generator may present evidence, and the authority having jurisdiction may make new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the original hearing. After receiving notice of an order by the authority having jurisdiction to change the frequency and/or methods of pumpage or servicing, it shall be unlawful for a generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer (POTW) not in compliance with such order.
(e)
Interceptor maintenance log.
(1)
Every generator having an interceptor shall maintain an interceptor maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous 12 months. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler and disposal site, and shall be kept in a conspicuous location on the premises of the facility for inspection. Food service establishments shall keep the log posted with their Camden County Environmental Health Food Permit. Said log shall be made immediately available to any authorized city inspector.
(2)
The information required in the maintenance log must be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction annually. The reporting period shall be January 1 through December 31 of each year. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the reporting period to the authority having jurisdiction.
(f)
Cleaning procedures.
(1)
The owner or an employee of the facility shall supervise the interceptor cleaning, and shall be physically present and observe the entire cleaning operation.
(2)
A generator shall cause the liquid waste hauler, transporter, or any other person cleaning or servicing an interceptor to completely evacuate all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids, of all grease and/or grit interceptors and other interceptors during servicing. Skimming the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of the interceptor or use of any method that does not remove the entire contents of the collection device is prohibited. The suction of the floating materials shall be done prior to removal of other contents. After complete evacuation, the walls, top, and bottom of the interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped and the residue removed. The interceptor shall then be steam cleaned and the residue removed. Upon completion of the servicing, the manager of the facility shall make an inspection of the interior of the interceptor and then personally sign the trip ticket. The manager shall make an appropriate entry in the facility interceptor maintenance log, and post the generator section of the trip ticket in a conspicuous place with the log on the premises. Food service establishments shall keep all trip tickets posted with their Camden County Environmental Health Food Permit. Said trip tickets and maintenance logs shall be made immediately available to any authorized city inspector.
(3)
It shall be unlawful for a generator to allow, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids back into an interceptor during and/or after servicing. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.
(4)
Each interceptor pumped shall be fully evacuated unless the interceptor volume is greater than the tank capacity on the vacuum truck in which case the transporter shall arrange for additional transportation capacity so that the interceptor is fully evacuated within a 24-hour period following the transporter's inability to fully evacuate the interceptor.
(g)
Disposal of interceptor pumpage. All waste removed from each interceptor shall be disposed of at a facility permitted and authorized to receive such waste in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the POTW, without prior written approval from the authority having jurisdiction, nor may it be returned to any portion of the POTW not specifically designated by the public works superintendent. Additionally, grease removed from an interceptor shall not be recycled so as to become a food product or part of a food product for animal or human consumption.
(h)
Vacuum truck cleaning service. It shall be unlawful for a grease or grit generator to allow grease or grit interceptor waste to be removed from his premises by a transporter who does not have all applicable federal, state, or local permits or registrations, including at a minimum a vacuum truck cleaning service occupation tax certificate from the authority having jurisdiction, and a Georgia EPD waste hauler's permit.
