PREFACE
This Code constitutes a Publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of South Fulton, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code include Ordinance No. 2017-001, adopted on April 29, 2017, and subsequent ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of any new material since that date in each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. The title number occurs before the dash; the chapter number is the first digit of the number following the dash; and the section number is represented by the last number in the sequence. Thus, section 3-4006 is section 6, located in chapter 4 of title 3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and title, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-4006 and 3-4007 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-4006.5. New chapters and new articles may be included in the same way or, in the case of chapters, may be placed at the end of the title embracing the subject, and, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new chapter or article. New titles may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

  Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mark Massey, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.
