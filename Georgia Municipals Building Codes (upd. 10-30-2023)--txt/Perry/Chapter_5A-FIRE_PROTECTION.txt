Sec. 5A-8. - Emergency entrance key lock box and access products.
When fires occur in buildings, the fire personnel are faced with issues of access to and entry into the structure. Access to and entry into the structure, in some cases, must be made with force which is time consuming and demands extra energy by fire personnel. In order to expedite entry into a structure and to aid the fire personnel in the task of extinguishment, the following requirements have been developed:
(a)

(c)
The fire marshal has designated the type of key lock box and other access systems to be implemented within the city that meet the standards contained in the International Fire Code (IFC) as the KNOX® Rapid Access Key Box and other KNOX® Access Products. The fire marshal shall have the authority to require all structures to use said designated system.

ARTICLE II. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND

Sec. 5A-11. - Purpose.
This article establishes the Perry Fire Protection Utility and sets up the fire protection utility enterprise fund.
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14)
Sec. 5A-12. - Findings of fact.
The mayor and the city council of the City of Perry make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The City of Perry is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of the services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein.
(2)
The City of Perry, Georgia, is authorized by its Charter to fix and establish fire protection service area limits and to extend, enlarge or restrict same from time to time to ensure effective delivery of such services.
(3)
In promulgating the provisions contained in this article, Perry is acting pursuant to its authority as granted by the Georgia Constitution, and the laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter, to provide fire protection and emergency management services to all properties within the city's service area. Fire protection and emergency management services are needed and provide benefits to all properties within the city's service area. For the purposes of this article, fire protection services shall be inclusive of emergency management services.
(4)
The cost of managing, operating and maintaining the Perry Fire Department, and the funding necessary for equipment, personnel and facilities thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in reasonable relationship to the services received by the public from the city's fire department and the fire protection program.
(5)
The operational and financing analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities as well as the city fire department's funding strategy for delivery of those services.
(6)
Given the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and the funding strategy identified in the aforementioned financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other resource management programs.
(7)
Fire protection services are applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, one service area encompassing all lands within the designated Perry Fire Protection Utility Service Area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(8)
It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of fire protection among the owners and/or occupants of all properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's fire department which result in services being rendered to such properties and the owners and/or occupants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should be based on a reasonable correlation to the fire protection services made available and provided to all properties.
(9)
The fire protection needs of the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents to the city.
(10)
A fire protection program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering fire protection services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement the defined level of service for fire protection within the city are through fire protection service fee charges and other funding mechanisms.
(11)
A schedule of fire protection service fee charges based on average heated square footage. The fire protection fees for customers are based on a residential equivalent unit (REU) basis as this methodology is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of fire protection services throughout the city.
(12)
Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, general fund revenues, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose location option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor or city council.
(13)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site fire protection/suppression facilities or systems which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the response burden imposed on the fire department, and the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services, should be taken into account with regard [to] a potential reduction to the service fee charge on that property in the form of a service fee charge reduction or a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such facilities in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the fire protection utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained fire protection/suppression facilities, systems and/or programs shall be generally proportional to the effect that such facilities, systems and programs have on reduction and/or mitigation of the fire risk and incident response burden associated with the property and the reduction in cost associated with provision of fire protection services related to that property.
(14)
It is imperative that the revenue from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems, or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such service fee charge revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city fire protection utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital and operations costs, or for other indebtedness for fire protection services.
(15)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Perry hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the community's fire protection service delivery needs. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a service charge rate structure to establish service fees for the provision of fire protection services to all properties within the defined Perry Fire Protection Utility Service Area.
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14)
Sec. 5A-13. - Fire protection utility enterprise fund established.
(a)
There is hereby established a fire protection utility to be known as the Perry Fire Protection Utility which shall be responsible for fire protection services throughout the Perry Fire Utility Service Area, and which shall provide for the management and operations associated with the city's fire protection facilities and services.
(b)
There is hereby established a fire protection utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting the designated funding applicable for the purposes and responsibilities of the Perry Fire Department and Fire Protection Utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the Perry Fire Protection Utility.
(c)
All revenues and receipts of the fire protection utility shall be placed in the fire protection utility enterprise fund in trust, to be extended solely for the provision of fire protection services; provided, however, that the city may allocate other revenues and/or resources not accounted for in the fire protection utility enterprise fund to fund fire protection services as deemed appropriate by the city.
(d)
The city shall place responsibility with the city manager, or his designee, for the management and operation of the fire protection utility and fire protection program services performed by Perry, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties upon which fire protection facilities are located, as well as certain equipment used for the provision of fire protection services.

Sec. 5A-14. - Fire protection utility service area.
There shall be one fire protection utility service area for the city which shall encompass the defined municipal limits of the Perry Fire Protection Utility Service Area.

A copy of the Perry Fire Protection Utility Service Area shall be maintained on file at city hall for public inspection.
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14)
Sec. 5A-15. - Scope of responsibility for fire protection services.
It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the municipal boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14)
Sec. 5A-16. - Fire protection service fees.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that service fees for fire protection services be provided by the fire protection utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the cost of the fire department to provide the defined fire protection level of service required to protect all persons, property and structures within the city. Fire protection fee charge rates shall be adopted via a rate ordinance and shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant service fees shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing fire protection services. A service fee shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for fire safety prevention and protection within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against fire protection service fees shall be provided for on-site fire protection/suppression facilities, systems and/or programs that are properly constructed, operated, and maintained and perform to the city's standards and which mitigate the fire risk and/or reduce the cost burden on the fire department related to the provision of fire protection services. All public and private property owners/customers are eligible to secure credits provided they meet applicable criteria established by the city.

Sec. 5A-36. - Fire protection fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
The property owner or utility customer account holder, as identified from city public utility billing database information, tax digest and other public records of Houston County, shall be obligated to pay the applicable fire protection fee charge.
(1)
Billing.
a.
Fire protection fees shall begin to accrue July, 2014, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for fire protection fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the fire protection utility customer of the following items (as a minimum): the fire protection fee charge amount (less any approved credits), the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
b.
Unless otherwise billed directly to the property owner, the fire protection fee charge will be billed and collected on a common statement and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be sent to the property owner.
c.
Frequency of the billing of fire protection fee charges shall be specified by the city.
d.
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each property subject to fire protection fee charges shall be ultimately obligated to pay fire protection fee charges and any interest at the rate of eighteen (18) percent per annum on delinquent fire protection fee charge payments.
e.
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of property, the fire protection utility may back bill for a period of up to three (3) years, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back-billed period.
(2)
Delinquencies and collections.
a.
Unpaid fire protection fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner or the property.
b.
A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any fire protection fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law and city ordinance provisions. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner and/or the customer.
(3)
Adjustments.
a.
The fire chief shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the fire protection fee charge.
1.
If a customer believes his fire protection fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the fire protection fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the fire chief and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city.
2.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate information to the fire chief, including, but not limited to, inspection reports from a certified fire protection professional or building construction plans certified by a registered architect or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city information. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the fire chief, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
3.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the fire chief, the fire chief shall within thirty (30) calendar days render a written decision.
4.
In considering an adjustment request, the fire chief shall consider whether the calculation of the fire protection fee charge for the property is correct.
5.
The fire chief's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
6.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next fire protection fee charge bill.
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14)
Sec. 5A-37. - Appeals and hearings.
(a)
Appeals. An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the fire chief. The appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) calendar days of the decision of the fire chief by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal, the fire chief shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken.
(b)
Hearings. The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing date.

The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the fire chief after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the fire chief is reversed in whole or in part resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner or customer, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative appeal. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may petition the Superior Court of Houston County for writ of certiorari.
