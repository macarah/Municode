Resignation. To resign in good standing, an employee shall give in writing to his or her department director at least ten (10) working days' prior notice. Normally, failure to comply with this rule shall be entered on the service record of the employee, shall result in a denial of reemployment rights and shall result in a reduction of accumulated annual leave by one (1) day of each calendar day less than the required ten (10) days' notice. However, in cases of exceptional circumstances, the department director, with the approval of the human resources director, may exempt an employee from any or all of these penalties.
(2)
Layoffs.
a.
Any involuntary separation not involving delinquency, misconduct or inefficiency, shall be considered a layoff.
b.
When, for any reason, it becomes necessary to reduce the working force in a department, employees shall be laid off on the basis of the following three (3) factors to be weighed equally: length of service in position, length of service with the city and the average performance rating for the last three (3) years of service or for the entire period if it is less than three (3) years.
c.
When a department director believes that a certain individual is essential to the efficient operation of the department or organizational unit because the employee possesses special skills or abilities, and the director wishes to retain this individual in preference to a person with a higher rating as provided above, the director shall submit a written request to the human resources director for permission to do so. This request shall justify the director's request by setting forth in detail the specific skills and abilities possessed by the individual and the reasons why the individual is essential to the effective operation of the department. With the approval of the human resources director, the individual may be retained.
d.
If a classified service employee is scheduled to be laid off, the employee shall be offered another position if a vacancy exists and the employee is qualified to fill the position.
e.

(Code 1977, § 2-7026; Ord. No. 45-90, § 2, 8-6-90; Ord. No. 34-94, 8-1-94; Ord. No. 38-96, § 1, 5-20-96; Ord. No. 19-14, § 1, 7-21-14)

(c)
There shall be no right for any employee to appeal a written reprimand or for a probationary employee to appeal any disciplinary action.

(a)
Administrative law judge. Hearings for employees who have a right of appeal under section 18-42(a) shall be conducted by an administrative law judge appointed by the mayor and council. The ALJ shall be a member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia.
(b)
Scheduling, etc.
(1)
After receipt of a hearing assignment the ALJ shall schedule the hearing to take place within fifteen (15) days of the notice of appeal by the employee and cause appropriate notices to be sent. The time and place of the hearing shall be set after consultation with the employee and department director.
(2)
For good cause shown the ALJ can continue a hearing for up to twenty (20) days past its originally scheduled date.
(3)
Not later than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing, the attorney for the employee shall enter his appearance with the ALJ with copies to the city attorney and human resources director. The employee or his attorney shall also notify the human resources director of all witnesses he intends to call and shall request copies of all documents or other information which has not already been furnished.
(c)
Group hearings. In situations where two (2) or more employees are charged with violations arising out of the same or related incidents, the ALJ may conduct group hearings if in his discretion he determines that a single hearing will not likely result in confusion and no employee will have his interests substantially prejudiced by a group hearing.
(d)
Conduct of the hearing.
(1)
Informality. Hearings shall be conducted in an informal manner with every effort made by the ALJ to avoid the appearance of conducting a trial as in a court of law.
(2)
Access to pertinent data. The ALJ shall have access to any files, correspondence, memoranda, etc. which he feels might be pertinent to the case and shall have the right of questioning any officers or employees of the city whom he feels may be able to shed light on the circumstances involving the disciplinary action in question. No officer or employee shall be subject to disciplinary action as a result of testimony given in such a hearing except in case of perjury.
(3)
Witnesses. The employee and department director are entitled to produce and examine witnesses. The city shall make its employees available as witnesses before the ALJ when requested by the ALJ after consideration of a request to him by either the employee or department director. Employees of the city are in a duty status during the time they are made available as witnesses.
(4)
Examination of witnesses. Upon request by either party, the witnesses shall be placed under the rule of sequestration. All testimony shall be under oath or affirmation. The department director or the city attorney, if representing the department director (but not both), and the affected employee or his representative (but not both) and the ALJ may question witnesses about any matters logically relevant to the charge against the employee and the proper disposition of the matter. The ALJ has authority to limit unproductively long or irrelevant questioning.
(5)
Conduct of participants. The ALJ may exclude any person from the hearing for contumacious conduct or misbehavior which obstructs the hearing.
(6)
Scope of hearing. The ALJ shall limit the evidence and testimony at the hearing to (a) the question of whether the employee is guilty of the charge(s) as set forth in the notice of discipline or similar related or lesser included offenses, and (b) the appropriateness of the discipline imposed by the department director.
(7)
Rules of evidence. The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence but shall be conducted in a manner conducive to a determination of the truth. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence which responsible persons are accustomed to rely on in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might prohibit the admission of such evidence in a civil action. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions and irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Decisions made by the ALJ shall not be invalidated by any informality in the proceedings.
(8)
Burden of proof, etc. The burden shall be on the department director to show that his action is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is that degree of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion that the matter asserted is true. He shall have the right to open and conclude.
(e)
Record. The hearing shall be reported by a certified court reporter and if ordered by the human resources director under subsection (g) shall be transcribed verbatim. All documents submitted to and accepted by the ALJ shall be made a part of the record. If the department director submits a document that is accepted, he shall furnish a copy to the employee. If the employee submits a document that is accepted, he/she shall make the document available to the city for reproduction. Any evidence and testimony offered at the hearing, but excluded by the ALJ, shall be described and that description made a part of the record.
(f)
ALJ's decision. Not later than five (5) days following the hearing, the ALJ shall forward copies of his report to the department director, the affected employee and the human resources director. Each report shall contain the following:
(1)
Findings of fact and conclusions. The ALJ shall enumerate his findings of facts and conclusions upon all material issues of fact presented at the hearing. Separate conclusions shall specifically set forth whether the employee is guilty of each violation in the notice of discipline or any similar related or lesser included offenses.
(2)
Recommended disposition. The ALJ shall recommend the appropriate disposition of the case which shall be one of the following:
a.
Reinstatement with or without all or part of the back pay;
b.
Written reprimand;
c.
Further suspension for a stated period of time without back pay to be followed by reinstatement;
d.
Demotion;
e.
Reduction in salary;
f.
Payment of damages for injury to or loss of city property up to the amount originally charged;
g.
Some combination of the above;
h.
Termination effective the date of the notice of termination.
(3)
Effective date. The report shall set forth the date upon which it shall become final in the absence of a request for further review, which date shall be five (5) days from the date of the report.
(4)
Notice of appeal. The report shall advise both parties that they can request a review by mayor and council of the ALJ's findings and recommended disposition by delivering a notice of appeal to the office of the human resources director within five (5) days from the date of the report.
(g)
Review of the ALJ's report.
(1)
The notice of appeal shall specifically set forth the appellant's reasons for requesting the review by setting forth precisely and in what respects the ALJ erred in his findings and recommended disposition. A request for review which states that the appellant desires to "appeal" without enumerating any errors committed by the ALJ is insufficient. The appeal will not be processed, and the employee and department director will be so notified by the human resources director.
(2)
The human resources director shall review the ALJ's report in light of the specific enumerations of error raised by the appellant and shall, if necessary for a proper review, direct that a verbatim transcript be prepared.
(3)
The department director and affected employee shall file any written comments or arguments which they desire to make in the human resources director's office within seven (7) days after the filing of the notice of appeal. The review shall be strictly on the record, and there shall be no further hearings before or oral presentations to the mayor and council.
(4)
Within three (3) days of receipt of any briefs from the employee and department director or the transcript, whichever is later, the human resources director shall transmit a copy of the charges, the transcript, the decision of the ALJ and any briefs to the mayor and council. The employee, department director and the city attorney shall be notified that the record has been transmitted to mayor and council.
(5)
The findings and order of the mayor and council shall be final and shall be rendered within thirty (30) days after receipt of the case for final action. A majority vote of the mayor and council shall be required to reverse the decision of the administrative law judge.

Sec. 18-44. - Employee indicted, charged or bound over.
Any employee of the city who is arrested, bound over to a grand jury, charged by accusation, or indicted for any criminal offense shall report same to their supervisor within forty-eight (48) hours. Department directors shall report any such arrest, etc. to the mayor.
Upon such arrest, accusation or indictment, the department director or mayor, as appropriate, after consulting with the human resources director, and if need, the city attorney, shall determine the appropriate action to be taken as follows:
(1)
If the offense(s) charged is also an offense against the employment relationship with the city, the appropriate disciplinary action should be instituted and the employee discharged if appropriate. In some cases under this category, it may be necessary to delay final disciplinary action pending disposition of criminal charges. In such a case the employee may be suspended without pay by the mayor after affording the employee appropriate due process rights and the opportunity for a hearing before the mayor to contest the suspension.
(2)
If the conduct resulting in the criminal charges does not relate directly to the duties of the position held, but is of a serious and aggravated nature so as to interfere with the employment relationship or embarrass the city, the employee may be suspended without pay pending disposition of charges. Appropriate due process rights shall be afforded to the employee including the opportunity for a hearing before the mayor to contest the suspension.
(3)
If the conduct resulting in the criminal charges is completely unrelated to city employment and will not be likely to damage the employer-employee relationship, the employee should usually be allowed to continue working.
An employee suspended pending the disposition of criminal charges shall not report to work or be present in his normal work site during the period of suspension.
If no disciplinary action is taken to suspend or terminate the employee, but he is nevertheless unavailable for work within five (5) calendar days of the institution of criminal charges, the position may be declared vacant and filled in the normal course of filling vacancies.

ARTICLE III. - SEXUAL HARASSMENT

Sec. 18-61. - Purpose.
The City of Warner Robins is proud of its professional and congenial work environment, and will take all necessary steps to insure that the work environment remains pleasant for all who work here. All employees must treat each other with courtesy, consideration and professionalism. The City of Warner Robins will not tolerate harassment of any employee by any other employee or supervisor for any reason. This policy applies to all city employees and applicants for employment. In addition, harassment for any discriminatory reason, such as race, sex, national origin, disability, age, or religion, is prohibited by state and federal laws, which may subject the City of Warner Robins and/or the individual harasser to liability for any such unlawful conduct. With this policy, the City of Warner Robins prohibits not only unlawful harassment, but also other unprofessional and discourteous actions. Accordingly, derogatory racial, ethnic, religious, age, sexual or other inappropriate remarks, slurs or jokes will not be tolerated.
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2200)
Sec. 18-62. - Definitions and rules.
(a)
Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:
(1)
Submission to the conduct is made either implicitly or explicitly a condition of the individual's employment;
(2)
Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision effecting the harassed employee; or
(3)
The harassment has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee's work performance or creating an environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive to the employee.
(b)
Each employee must exercise his or her own good judgment to avoid engaging [in] conduct that may be perceived by others as harassment. Forms of harassment include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Verbal. Repeated sexual innuendoes, racial or sexual epithets, derogatory slurs, off-colored jokes, propositions, threats, or suggestive or insulting sounds;
(2)
Visual/non-verbal. Derogatory posters, cartoon, or drawings; suggestive objects or pictures; graphic commentaries, leering, or obscene gestures;
(3)
Physical. Unwanted physical contact, including touching, interference with an individual's normal work movement, or assault and/or battery; and
(4)
Other. Making or threatening reprisals as a result of a negative response to harassment.
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2210)
Sec. 18-63. - Procedures.
Any employee who believes that he/she is or may be subjected to objectionable conduct must report it immediately to his/her supervisor or to the department of human resources. Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating that situation. If the employee's supervisor is involved, the employee does not need to contact that individual first but may proceed directly to the director of human resources or the mayor. The City of Warner Robins also will not tolerate employees filing wholly unfounded or frivolous complaints alleging sexual harassment or discrimination. While each complaint will be thoroughly investigated, those complaints having no basis in fact or reality, and those claims brought solely to harass another employee, to tarnish another employee's reputation, or to "get back" at another employee are strictly prohibited and may result in discipline up to and including discharge.
Upon receipt of an allegation of sexual harassment or any other form of harassment prohibited herein, the city will make a prompt, thorough and objective investigation of the allegation. This investigation will respect the rights of both the accuser and the accused. The assistant city attorney for human resources will conduct the investigation. The investigation will be completed in an expeditious manner and if at all possible within five (5) working days.
At the conclusion of the investigation the mayor, department director, and the assistant city attorney for human resources will make a determination as to whether the complaint was founded or unfounded. If unfounded, the complaint will be dismissed and if found to be wholly unfounded or frivolous appropriate discipline may be taken against the accuser. If the complaint is determined to be true then the mayor, department director and the assistant city attorney for human resources will promptly formulate a plan for remedial action for the situation. This remedial plan may include, but is not limited to, separation of the parties, counseling for the offending party and any other disciplinary action allowed by the personnel rules and regulations up to and including termination. Each case will be judged on its own merits on a case by case basis. The severity of the remedial action will be based upon the seriousness of the conduct.
Any employee who brings such a complaint to the attention of the city, in good faith, will not be adversely effected as a result of reporting the harassment. The city will preserve the confidentiality of harassment complainants and witnesses as much as possible consistent with a thorough investigation. Once an investigation is initiated, confidentiality may no longer be practicable or [in] the best interest of the city in light of open records laws or the need to quell gossip that can affect employee morale, reputation and working efficiency. To encourage candor and cooperation during the investigative process, however, the final report and all supporting data, including transcripts of written summaries of statements by witnesses, will be available only to those who, in the judgment of the mayor or his designee, have a bona fide need to know and to those legally entitled to disclosure.
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2220)
Sec. 18-64. - Prohibition against retaliation.
Retaliation against an employee for protesting or reporting violations or apparent violations of this policy, or for filing a complaint, will not be tolerated. Any person found to have retaliated against an employee is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2230)
