DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 23-46. - Purpose and intent.
The City of Warner Robins recognizes and supports the public's right of assembly and free speech and to utilize designated public facilities for such purposes. At the same time, the city has an important and compelling governmental interest in protecting property, public safety, health and welfare, and controlling use of streets and other public facilities and venues. This article seeks to accommodate public rights of speech and assembly consistent with that governmental interest by establishing procedures, terms, and conditions for use of public areas and facilities for such purposes. A second purpose of this article is to facilitate and manage the manner in which public facilities that are not otherwise required for governmental operations may be made available for use on a temporary basis for non-governmental operations.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-47. - Scope; authority.
This article applies to all public parades and assemblies that may be expected to affect the public, the property or services of the city, to otherwise require an expenditure of time and expenses or create the potential for liability or public disturbance or other substantial concern. This article also applies to requests for use of public facilities for purposes other than governmental operations. This article is adopted in accordance with the authority vested in the city by its Charter, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3 and all other applicable state and federal law.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)

(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-50. - General exceptions.
(a)
Permit exceptions. Permits and prior approvals under this article are not required for:
(1)
Funeral processions; or
(2)
Spontaneous events involving a parade or public assembly occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within seven (7) days prior to such public assembly, provided that:
a.
The event occurs on private property or a public area in a manner that does not unduly disrupt or inconvenience the public in the use of such area; and
b.

Exceptions and waivers from requirements for payment of fees and expenses, proof of insurance, bonding, or other security may be approved solely in accordance with those sections of this article applicable to such activities or events.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-51. - General standards and procedures.
(a)
Decision-making unrelated to content of expression. To achieve the purposes of this article without undue interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, decisions to issue, deny, or conditionally approve permits shall not be based on the content of a message associated with the event absent a compelling governmental interest.

(b)
Time, place and manner controls. This article seeks to impose reasonable time, place and manner controls in an appropriate and limited manner upon events and facility uses for which permits are required.

Except for permits involving streets, facilities, or venues, or types of events identified for either expedited processing or requiring longer-term processing as identified in section 23-53 or elsewhere in this article, application for permits shall be filed not less than seven (7) days nor more than ninety (90) days, before the event for which the permit is sought.
(e)
Requirements for insurance, bonding or other security. To avoid interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, any requirement imposed for surety for performance (including but not limited to insurance, bonding, or monetary deposits) shall be based upon needs directly associated with the event and not on the basis of possible disruption of the event by protestors or other persons who might be opposed to the speech or assembly.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-52. - Standard application process.
(a)
The process set forth in this section includes the standard procedure and requirements that apply to all applications for permits under this article. Additional requirements and exceptions or waivers for specific types of permits are set forth in divisions 2 and 3 of this article.
(b)
The administrator shall create and provide application forms for each type of permit required by this article. The information required by the application shall be the minimum information that is required of any applicant. The application form shall include information designed to allow the city to act on the application in an informed manner to determine if the application meets the requirements of this article including potential adverse effects as stated herein, and to allow the city to determine what requirements, if any, should be imposed as a condition of issuance of the permit. The administrator may amend any application form in whole or in part on such notice as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances, provided that an amendment shall not apply to an application made prior to the administrator's formal notice of any proposed amendment to the application form.
(c)
Without limiting the authority of the administrator to require reasonable additional information in connection with any specific application, such forms shall require the applicant to identify:
(1)
The name, address, and telephone number of the person or the agent or representative of an organization or entity seeking to obtain the permit.
(2)
The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the headquarters or business location of the organization seeking the permit or organizing or sponsoring the event or activity, if any, and the authorized and responsible heads of the organization.
(3)
If the application is filed by any person other than an individual applying on the individual's own behalf, the application shall include written authorization from that other person or from a responsible, legally authorized representative of an organizational applicant authorizing the applicant to apply for the permit on its behalf.
(4)
The requested date, time, and location for the event or activity.
a.
The location description also shall identify the content of the public and private areas that will be involved in the activity or event.
b.
The time shall include the time during which the event or activity will be conducted and the time(s) during which preparation, set-up, assembly, clean-up or other actions may occur.
(5)
The approximate number of persons who are anticipated to attend or participate in the activity or event, including a separate list of the number of any anticipated spectators, protestors, or counter-demonstrators, as appropriate.

The application shall be signed by the applicant or the applicant's duly authorized representative or agent under oath or affirmation.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-53. - Expedited or extended application review.
(a)
Upon request of an applicant, the administrator may agree to an expedited application review when the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the standard review process (1) is not required due to size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors, indicating that public safety, welfare, and convenience would not be affected by expedited review or (2) would substantially burden protected rights, including speech and assembly, as to matters of public concern and the expedited review process would allow reasonable review to address substantial matters of public safety, welfare, and convenience.
(b)
Upon determining that the size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors that affect public safety, welfare, and convenience, require more intensive review of an application, the administrator, after notice to the applicant, may extend the standard review period by a time not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-54. - Fees.
(a)
A non-refundable application processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to cover administrative costs of processing the permit application shall be paid to the city by the applicant when the application is filed.
(b)
The city may require the applicant to pay rental fees, service charges, or costs incurred by the city in accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-55. - Police protection; public works and other expenses.
(a)
Police protection.
(1)
If possible, without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety and welfare, regularly scheduled on-duty police personnel shall cover the event. The administrator shall seek review of any application which might require additional police personnel by the police chief.
(2)
When reviewing an application, the police chief shall determine whether and to what extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for traffic control and public safety and welfare, including public convenience. The police chief shall base this decision on relevant criteria including, but not limited to, the size, location, duration, time and date of the event; the expected sale or serving of alcoholic beverages; the number of streets and intersections blocked; and the need to detour or preempt public travel and use of streets and sidewalks.
(3)
The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary.
(4)
If additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the police chief, he shall so inform the administrator and applicant. The applicant shall be responsible for bearing the cost of the additional police protection deemed necessary by the police chief. The chief may, but is not required to, approve use of private security details, to be paid for by the applicant, in lieu of any or all special detail city police services that might otherwise be required under this section.
(b)
Public works. In the same manner, the city shall determine if the applicant shall be required to pay for or provide additional public works-related actions such as lighting, refuse receptacle and pick-up, sanitary facilities, traffic control signs, devices, or personnel.
(c)
Other expenses. In circumstances where the event itself may be expected to cause the city to incur additional, extraordinary expenses, the administrator shall identify such expenses and the basis for determining them to be extraordinary. Such expenses may be imposed upon the applicant as a condition of approval of the permit.
(d)
Expense exception. An applicant for an event conducted for the sole purpose of public issue speech protected under the First Amendment or the Georgia Constitution as determined by the administrator shall not be required to pay for police protection or public works or other expense for actions provided by the city. However, the applicant shall obtain a permit as required by this article.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-56. - Reserved.
Sec. 23-57. - Standards for action on application.
In addition to standards applicable to particular events or activities under other provisions of this article, a permit shall be issued when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, the administrator finds that:
(1)
The application is complete and sets forth accurately and in sufficient detail the information required for consideration.
(2)
Conduct of the event will not unduly inconvenience either the public in using public areas normally open for general public use or the city in the conduct of governmental operations.
(3)
Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or will be made available in or adjacent to the area in which the event will be held.
(4)
There are sufficient parking places near the site of the event to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected.
(5)
The applicant has secured or provided for the cost of additional police protection or otherwise arranged for event security, if any, as may be required under section 23-55.
(6)
The application has paid or provided for payment of any expenses or costs as may be required under section 23-55.
(7)
No event is scheduled elsewhere in the city where city resources (including but not limited to law enforcement, fire, or public works personnel) required for the events are so great that their deployment would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property.
(8)
No permit may be issued that allows for the erection or placement of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a city street, sidewalk, or right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the structure is obtained from the city council or administrator or other appropriate official or agency.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-58. - Non-discrimination.
The administrator shall uniformly consider each application upon its merits and shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this article based upon political, religious, ethnic, race, disability, sexual orientation or gender-related grounds or other criteria that would constitute a violation of state or federal law.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-59. - Recurring events; continuing permits.
Regularly held and scheduled events that would otherwise require issuance of a permit under this article may receive longer-term approvals, not to exceed three (3) years in duration that will constitute permit approval under this article. Such longer-term approvals may be issued if the administrator finds that:
(1)
The location for the events is in a place that has been approved for such purpose by site plan review (or its equivalent) by the planning board or otherwise is approved as a location for the events by the administrator; and
(2)
The police chief, fire chief and public works director each have reviewed the location and schedule for the proposed events and have notified the administrator that they have no objection to the conduct of the events according to the schedule proposed.
(3)
Any approvals under this section shall be subject to modification or termination upon a determination by the administrator of changed conditions, circumstances or needs of the city. Any such determination shall be subject to the appeal process under section 23-62 and shall not prevent the applicant from applying for a permit under other provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12)
Sec. 23-60. - Administrative action on application.
(a)
Upon receiving an application, the administrator shall determine within twenty-four (24) hours if the application is complete or if any additional preliminary information is required and shall so inform the applicant. The applicant shall provide such required information prior to further consideration of the application. The requirement to supplement the application at this stage does not prevent the city from requiring additional information during its review and action upon the application.
(b)
After accepting an application, the administrator shall forward it for review and recommendation to the police chief and to any other city employee, official or board deemed appropriate. Such review and recommendation shall occur within three (3) days unless that period is extended by the administrator.
(c)
The administrator also may refer the application for review by other governmental entities (e.g. county, regional or state authorities) as deemed appropriate.
(d)
After receiving comments and recommendations from such reviews and after considering such other information as deemed appropriate, the administrator may require the applicant to submit additional information or respond to the reviews and recommendations or impose such conditions as are appropriate under the circumstances.
(e)
Upon completion of the foregoing, the administrator shall act on the application. The administrator may approve, amend, approve with conditions, or deny the application. For any action other than approval as submitted, the administration shall include a brief summary of the reasons for the decision.
(f)
Unless otherwise provided in this article or agreed to by the applicant, the administrator shall act on an application within five (5) days after determining that the application is complete in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If a completed application has been submitted in a timely manner, the administrator shall in any event act upon the application and provide notice to the applicant in accordance with section 23-57 no later than two (2) days prior to the event.
(g)
The administrator may authorize the conduct of the event at a date, time, location, or route different from that proposed by the applicant. An applicant desiring to accept such an alternate permit shall so notify the administrator in writing not less than three (3) days after notice of the administrator's action, or, if less than five (5) days remain before the event after notice of the administrator's action, within twenty-four (24) hours. An alternate permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a permit issued under this article.

(1)
Interim appeal.

a.
The applicant shall notify the administrator in writing of the claim specifying in detail the basis for the claim. The administrator shall review the notice and determine if administrative action will adequately resolve the problem.
b.
If the applicant is not satisfied by such administrative action, the applicant may file a written appeal within forty-eight (48) hours to the mayor, with a copy to the city clerk specifying the grounds for the appeal. The mayor shall review the appeal to determine if he will hear the matter or if he/she determines that grounds for appeal are not properly set forth.
c.
If the mayor determines that the appeal will not be heard, he/she shall notify the applicant within twenty-four (24) hours of such decision. If the appeal proceeds, the mayor shall schedule a hearing on the matter within two (2) days with such notice to the applicant as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. At the hearing, the mayor shall hear the applicant, administrator, and such other persons as may be allowed to speak. Within forty-eight (48) hours after the hearing, the mayor shall issue his/her decision in writing and shall so notify the applicant.
(2)
Appeal of final action. The applicant or any person directly affected by final administrative action on an application may file a written appeal with the city council with a copy to the city clerk no later than three (3) days after the final action. The appeal shall state with specificity the grounds for the appeal. The city council may deny an appeal without a hearing if it determines on the face of the appeal (within fourteen (14) days of the filing of the appeal) that it has no merit and shall so notify the applicant and other directly affected parties within forty-eight (48) hours after such determination. If the appeal proceeds, the city council shall schedule a hearing within fourteen (14) days of the filing of the appeal. The appeal hearing shall be limited to the grounds stated in the appeal unless the city council for good cause determines to hear other issues or concerns. The appellant/applicant (if not the appellant), the administrator and other persons directly affected may speak or submit evidence at the hearing. The city council may determine who is permitted to participate in the hearing. The city council shall issue its decision on the appeal, stating the reasons for its decision, within five (5) days after the hearing.

Unless otherwise allowed by the administrator, an application for a parade permit shall be made within the following time periods:
(1)
At least thirty (30) days prior to the event date for arterial streets (as that term is defined in the city's subdivision ordinance) and events expected to involve more than one hundred (100) individuals.
(2)
At least fourteen (14) days for all other streets and events expected to involve one hundred (100) or fewer individuals.
(b)
Whenever an applicant believes that the time normally required for action on a permit under paragraph (a) will interfere with protected rights of speech or assembly or would render ineffective the purpose for which the event is proposed, the applicant shall include in the application a written request for expedited review, including a description of the basis therefore. The administrator shall promptly review such request and, unless it is determined that cause for expedited review is not stated, shall grant expedited review within such time as may be reasonably required to meet the purposes of this article. If the administrator determines that expedited review is not appropriate, a written decision shall be issued stating the reasons for that decision. A denial of expedited review may be reviewed using the interim [no reference to an "expedited" appeal in section 23-62] appeal process under section 23-62.
