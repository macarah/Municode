Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the utility director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 44, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-225. - Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 45, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-226. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as indicated in section (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the utility director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 46, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-227. - Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 47, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-228. - Record keeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or Warner Robins, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the utility director.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 48, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-229. - Right of entry; inspection and sampling.
The utility director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the utility director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1)
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the utility director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(2)
The utility director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
(3)
The utility director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy.
(4)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the utility director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(5)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the utility director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 49, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-230. - Search warrants.
If the utility director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of Warner Robins designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the utility director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Municipal Court of the City of Warner Robins.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 50, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-231. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the utility director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the utility director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 51, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-232. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The utility director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the utility director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the utility directors exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within thirty (30), days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violation(s) which the utility director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 52, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-233. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
When the utility director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within seven (7) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the utility director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the utility director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 53, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-234. - Consent orders.
The utility director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to section 24-236 and section 24-237 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 54, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-235. - Show cause hearing.
The utility director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the utility director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 55, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-236. - Compliance orders.
When the utility director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 56, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-237. - Cease and desist orders.
When the utility director finds that a use has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the utility director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 57, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-238. - Administrative fines.
(a)
When the utility director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(b)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the utility director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within twenty (20) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the utility director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The utility director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(c)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 58, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-239. - Emergency suspensions.
The utility director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The utility director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utility director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utility director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 24-240 of this article are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utility director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-235 or 24-240 of this article.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 59, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-240. - Termination of discharge.
In addition to the provisions in section 24-213 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 24-194 through 24-198 of this article.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-235 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the utility director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 60, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-241. - Injunctive relief.
When the utility director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility director may petition the Houston Superior Court through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The utility director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 61, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-242. - Civil penalties.
(a)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to Warner Robins for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(b)
The utility director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by Warner Robins.
(c)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(d)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 62, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-243. - Criminal prosecution.
(a)
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
(b)
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(c)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 63, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-244. - Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The utility director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Warner Robins enforcement response plan. However, the utility director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the utility director is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 64, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-245. - Upset.
(a)
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(b)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met.
(c)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1)
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2)
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3)
The user has submitted the following information to the utility director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset.
a.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
b.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time thee noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days.
(d)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(f)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 65, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-246. - Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 24-194(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 24-194(b)(3) through 24-194(b)(15) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 66, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-247. - Bypass.
(a)
For the purposes of this section,
(1)
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2)
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utility director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the utility director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utility director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
(d)
(1)
Bypass is prohibited, and the utility director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
The utility director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utility director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 67, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-248. - Pretreatment charges and fees.
Warner Robins may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Warner Robins Pretreatment Program which may include:
(1)
Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications;
(2)
Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
(3)
Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;
(4)
Fees for filing appeals; and
(5)
Other fees as Warner Robins may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by Warner Robins.

If provision of this article is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 69, 5-8-97)
Sec. 24-250. - Regulation of non-domestic kitchen facilities.
(a)
General. It shall be unlawful for any non-domestic kitchen to discharge, or cause to be discharged, processing wastewater to the POTW which contains oils, greases, solids, or liquids sufficient to cause obstruction or otherwise interfere with the proper operations of the POTW.
(b)
Pretreatment.
(1)
Required. Non-domestic kitchens discharging to the POTW shall install, operate, clean, and maintain a sufficiently sized oil and grease, water and solids, separator (herein called grease traps) necessary to achieve compliance with requirements set forth under this provision.
(2)
Design criteria.
a.
Plumbing and grease trap size requirements. Only kitchen wastewater shall be discharged into grease traps. Any other wastewaters, specifically including, but not limited to, any restroom wastewater, shall not be routed to or through grease traps. Grease trap size will be in the sole determination of the utility director.
b.
Construction. Grease traps shall be water tight and constructed of sound and durable materials not subject to excessive corrosion, decay, or frost damage, or to cracking or buckling due to settlement or backfilling. Tanks and covers shall be designed and constructed so as to withstand normal structural loadings. A tank installed in ground water shall be weighted to prevent the tank from floating when empty.
c.
Depth of tees. The inlet tee shall extend two (2) feet below water line. The outlet tee shall extend to within twelve (12) inches of the bottom of the tank. Tees shall be cast iron or schedule 40 PVC.
d.
Baffles. Baffles may be provided as necessary to maximize the separation of grease from the wastewater. Baffles shall not be a substitute for inlet and outlet tees.
e.
Base. Grease traps shall be installed on a level, stable base that will not settle.
f.
Materials. Grease traps may be constructed of poured reinforced concrete, precast reinforced concrete, or prefabricated material acceptable to the utility director or designee.
g.
Access manholes. Grease traps shall be provided with a minimum of two (2) twenty-four-inch diameter manhole frames and covers to grade over the inlet and outlet tees.
(3)
Additives.
a.
It shall constitute a violation of this article to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the city sewer lines, pump stations or treatment plant unless prior written authority has been received from the utility director. Use of other substances, including enzymes and special bacteria, is solely at the discretion of the customer.
b.
The utility director shall have the authority to prohibit the addition of any substances, including enzymes and bacteria, which creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential hazard to personnel.
c.
If upon inspection, it is determined that a grease trap is in need of cleaning, the only acceptable means of cleaning shall be to have the trap pumped for disposal as provided elsewhere in this section. Applying heavy doses of chemicals, enzymes, or bacteria to the grease trap is expressly prohibited as a substitute for pumping and removing the material from the trap.
d.
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable grease trap.
(4)
Grease trap maintenance.
a.
Pumping. All grease traps shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the removal of all trapped grease and settled solids.
b.
Content removal frequency. All grease traps shall be pumped out at least every twelve (12) weeks, with discretion given to the utility director (or designee) to deviate from this schedule.
c.
Disposal of grease trap waste. All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed of at a site permitted by the appropriate governmental authority. In no way shall the waste be introduced into the city P.O.T.W. without written approval of the utility director. Notice shall be taken that public or private rights-of-way, manholes, public property, storm sewers, lakes, creeks and streams are not disposal sites permitted by proper governmental authority, and discharge to any of these is a violation of the Federal Clean Water Act in addition to a violation of state and local law and ordinances.
(c)

Editor's note— Ord. No. 56-97, §§ 1—10, adopted May 8, 1997, set out new sewer use and sewage disposal regulations. Inasmuch as there were no user charge provisions included in that ordinance, the former provisions of Div. 2, §§ 24-196—24-201 and 24-216—24-221, User charges, have been included in the Code as Div. 3, §§ 24-263—24-268 and 24-274—24-279, at the direction of the city.

Subdivision I. - General Provisions

Sec. 24-263. - Single-family residential service.
There shall be a monthly base charge of six dollars and eighty cents ($6.80) per account for single-family residential sewer service, plus a volume charge shall be fourteen and five-tenths cents ($.145) per one hundred (100) gallons of water used. Where appropriate, the following policies shall apply:
(1)
A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during November through April shall be charged based upon actual water consumption. Such customer's maximum monthly volume billing during the subsequent May through October period shall be based upon the system average monthly volume for single-family residential customers, vis., 8.4 K gallons. In subsequent months, the above method of billing existing customers applies. On a case-by-case basis, the city should evaluate such new connection prior to the May through October billings; if the city determines that a typical usage pattern has been established by such new connections, the average of the number of months of such typical consumption shall apply as the May through October maximum.
(2)
A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during May through October shall be charged based upon the system average November through April monthly consumption, vis., 8.4 K gallons. During the subsequent November through April period, the charge is based upon actual water consumption.
(3)
In the event that a given single-family residential connection exhibits clearly nontypical monthly consumption in some or all months during April through November, then the city shall adjust the maximum monthly volume for May through October on a case-by-case basis in order to achieve adequate accuracy of billing. For example, a given connection might have zero consumption for one (1) or more months in which case the average consumption would be based upon the reduced number of months for which usage is typical for such connection. If there are reliable grounds for the city to declare all monthly consumption during April through November for a given connection to be nontypical, then the monthly maximum volume for May through October shall be the above referenced system average for single-family residential connections for the period, vis., 8.4 K gallons.
