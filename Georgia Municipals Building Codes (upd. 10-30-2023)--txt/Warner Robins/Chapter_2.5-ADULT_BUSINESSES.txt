Cross reference— Adult entertainment in alcoholic beverage establishments, § 4-38.

Sec. 2.5-1. - Introduction.
Based on the City of Warner Robins' own experiences with an establishment offering public nudity in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages and the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Peach County, Georgia, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Warner Robins, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by citizens, and an expert in economic development at the public hearing on January 6, 1997; and based on documentary evidence submitted to the Warner Robins City Council, the city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the Warner Robins City Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Warner Robins as well.
The Warner Robins City Council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments. Therefore, the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment. The city council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is hereby adopted.
