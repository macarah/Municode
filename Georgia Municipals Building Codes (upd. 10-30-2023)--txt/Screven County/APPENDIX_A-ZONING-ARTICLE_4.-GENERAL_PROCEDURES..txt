The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the building official. He should complete the application form and submit it to the building official, together with any supporting documentation which the building official may specify.
F.
No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the building official to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the building official will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the building official that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the zoning administrator as to the violation.
G.

H.
Before a building permit is issued by the building official, the Screven County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this ordinance.

When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of an existing use, the building official will inspect the use and determine what, if anything, is needed to bring the use into conformance with the applicable building codes and development regulations before a building permit may be issued.
J.
The building official is in charge of issuing building permits. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application, the building official is satisfied that the proposed project can meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances. The building official may require the submission of additional information in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this ordinance.
K.
If the building official determines that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten working days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the building official to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit.
L.
Construction on an approved project must start within six months from the date of issue of the building permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired at a future date. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project is completed, construction must be restarted within 12 months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of building permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the building official.
M.
All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in Screven County. The building official will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes.
N.
The building official may revoke any building permit where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact or condition in the application or plans on which the permit was based, and upon such revocation, all construction, improvements or alterations as authorized by such permit or approval, shall cease until a valid building permit is issued.

Sec. 409. - Certificate of occupancy required.
A.
[A] certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued may be occupied or used. The certificate of occupancy must be signed by the zoning administrator and attest that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this ordinance have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this ordinance.
B.
The zoning administrator will issue the certificate of occupancy upon notification by the building official that all applicable building codes and other uniform development standards and ordinances have been met. However, if the building official finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the zoning administrator will not issue the certificate of occupancy. The zoning administrator will notify the owner/contractor within ten working days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the zoning administrator to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy.
Sec. 410. - Appealing an action of the zoning administrator or building official.
A.
If the zoning administrator or building official executes an action which the aggrieved party believes to be contrary to this ordinance, that action may be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action by the zoning administrator or building official was taken.
B.
The planning and zoning commission has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the zoning administrator or building official related to this ordinance. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the zoning administrator, who will transmit them to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration.
C.
When an action of the zoning administrator or building official is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the building official may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the building official may certify to the planning and zoning commission that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless the construction is halted by the planning and zoning commission or a restraining order is granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
D.
When an application for appeal of an action of the zoning administrator or building official is received, the planning and zoning commission shall set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Screven County at least 15 days before the hearing.

(Ord. of 4-13-2021(2), §§ 11, 12)
Sec. 411. - Variances.
A.
A variance is a permit, issued by the planning and zoning commission, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that varies from requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where an undue hardship would result if all of the requirements of this ordinance were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. A hardship means that a permitted use of a lot is not reasonable if all of the requirements of this ordinance are to be met. A hardship may exist for medical reasons which would permit the temporary placement of a manufactured home, meeting applicable development standards, on the same parcel as the original principal dwelling. Such temporary dwelling shall be placed behind the principle and within 300 feet of the principal dwelling. Such temporary dwelling shall provide living quarters for an infirm family member or to provide living quarters for a family member or certified/registered assisted living employee to aid in the care of one or more infirm family members living in the original principal dwelling. Variances approved for medical hardship cases shall be reviewed annually by the planning and zoning commission. When the medical hardship ceases to exist, the owner of the principal dwelling shall notify the zoning administrator. Such manufactured home shall be removed within 30 days, or subject to owner of the principle dwelling to fines and penalties as outlined in section 418. The hardship cannot be self-created such as:
1.
A lot purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction.
2.
A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales.
3.
An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance.
B.
A variance shall not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this ordinance.
C.
When a variance is issued, the spirit of this ordinance must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located.
D.
The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the planning and zoning commission, except that in consideration of a rezoning of property from one zoning district to another, the board of commissioners may approve a variance in connection with its approval of a conditional rezoning.
E.
Application for a variance may be made with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will take the required information and transmit it to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration. If an applicant for a variance is, at the time of such application, operating a use which requires a variance without having received variance approval, and/or is determined by the zoning administrator to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, as it pertains to the application in question, then the fee for processing the variance application shall be two times the normal variance application fee and the applicant shall cease operations or activities while the variance application is pending. The zoning administrator shall not process any application from that applicant as it pertains to the property in question until the applicant remedies the violation and ceases to be in violation, to the extent practical as determined by the zoning administrator. If the variance application is approved and it remedies the violation, the applicant may continue the activity or operation. If the variance application is not approved, the applicant shall be prevented from continuing the activity or operation applied for until otherwise compliant with the county zoning ordinance.
F.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the zoning administrator will then accept the application for variance.
G.
When an application for a variance is received, the planning and zoning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Screven County at least 15 days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file. The zoning administrator shall post a sign at least two feet by three feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing before the planning and zoning commission. The sign must set forth the subject of the hearing, date, time and place of the scheduled public hearing.
H.
All persons who wish to address the planning and zoning commission at a hearing concerning an appeal under consideration by the planning and zoning commission shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the zoning administrator prior to the commencement of the hearing.
I.
The chairman or his designee will read the proposed appeal under consideration, and the departmental reviews pertaining thereto, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed appeal. Appeals shall be called in the order in which they were filed.
J.
The chairman or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal then before the planning and zoning commission in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except that the applicant who shall speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his or her current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless two-thirds of the members of the planning and zoning commission present at the hearing allow the person to speak to the appeal.
K.
Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed appeal under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the member of the planning and zoning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or from discussing facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed appeal under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection.
L.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on the appeal is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
M.
The planning and zoning commission will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
N.
The planning and zoning commission may impose any other conditions which must be complied with by the applicant to compensate for the requirements varied from.
O.
Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months.
P.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the planning and zoning commission on an application for a variance may appeal the decision of the planning and zoning commission to the Screven County Board of Commissioners which shall hear such appeal pursuant to the same procedures established for consideration of a variance by the planning and zoning commission.

Local zoning provision to allow for DRI review. For new developments proposed within Screven County which meet or exceed the minimum threshold identified in the department of community affair's Procedures and Guidelines for the review of developments of regional impact (DRI).

The county shall be allowed up to a maximum of 30 days to complete the review process for large development projects that are likely to create impacts in other local jurisdictions. The county will not take any official action to further any such developments until the DRI review process is completed.
(Ord. of 4-13-2021(2), § 15)
Sec. 413. - Conditional use.
A.
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the board of commissioners after receiving a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. These uses are identified in this ordinance as conditional uses and such uses are allowed only under the circumstances specified in this ordinance.
B.
The developer or owner wishing to request a conditional use must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a conditional use. However, the power to approve a conditional use rests with the board of commissioners.
C.
Application for a conditional use shall be filed with the zoning administrator. If an applicant for conditional use is operating a use which requires a conditional use without conditional use approval, and/or is determined by the zoning administrator to be in violation of the zoning ordinance as it pertains to the application in question, then the fee for processing the conditional use shall be two times the normal conditional use permit fee and the conditional use applicant shall cease operations of the conditional use while the conditional use application is pending. The zoning administrator shall not process any application from that applicant as it pertains to the property in question until the applicant remedies the violation and ceases to be in violation, to the extent practical as determined by the zoning administrator. If the conditional use is approved and it remedies the violation, the conditional use applicant may continue the activity or operation. If the conditional use is not approved, the applicant shall be prevented from continuing the activity or operation applied for until otherwise compliant with the the county zoning ordinance.
D.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by [of subsection] C above, the zoning administrator will then accept the application for conditional use.
E.
When an application for a conditional use is filed, it shall be considered under the same procedure as required for an amendment to the official zoning map under the provisions of section 414, except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this section. If the application requires a review period, the 60-day time limit in subsection 414(I) shall not start until all reviews are completed as determined by the zoning administrator.
F.
The planning and zoning commission and board of commissioners will consider the following standards in arriving at a decision on the conditional use:

2.
It must not be that any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties are greater than the benefits or need for the conditional use.
3.
It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use.
4.
It must meet all other requirements of this ordinance.
G.
The planning and zoning commission may recommend and board of commissioners may impose any additional conditions and development standards, along with the grant of a conditional use, as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of the workers and residents and to protect the surrounding landowners and neighborhoods.
H.
The board of commissioners is not bound by the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, and after consideration of the standards set forth in subsection G, the board of commissioners may grant or deny the application for a conditional use and, if granted, establish such additional conditions and developments standards at it deems appropriate to satisfy the standards in subsection G.
I.
If the building official finds that any restrictions upon which a conditional use was granted is not being complied with, it may suspend the permit for the conditional use until such time as the applicant brings the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners. Only work upon the conditional use may be allowed during suspension of the permit which is necessary to bring the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners.
J.
The chairman or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal then before the planning and zoning commission in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except that the applicant who shall speak first.

The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection.
L.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on the appeal is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

The planning and zoning commission shall make a written record of its recommendation on the proposed amendment and forward a copy of its recommendation to the board of commissioners within 60 days of the date on which a completed application for the proposed amendment was received and determined complete (see subsection 703.B.12.g.) by the zoning administrator. If the planning and zoning commission fails to send its recommendations to the board of commissioners within the aforesaid 60 days, it shall mean that the planning and zoning commission recommends approval of the amendment. Should it become necessary for an applicant to make changes or amendments to an application within this 60-day time frame, the proposed process will start over.
J.
After receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Screven County at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. If the amendment is for the rezoning of property from one district to another and is initiated by a party other than the board of commissioners, then the notice shall also include the location of the property, the present zoning district of the property, and the proposed zoning district of the property.
K.
The following policies and procedures will be observed in conducting the required public hearing:
1.
The hearing will be held in the Screven County Courthouse, Sylvania, Georgia.
2.
Written comments on the subject of the hearing may be submitted by any citizen or property owner at any time prior to the adjournment of the hearing.

Persons desiring to be heard orally may present their views at the hearing, but shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the board prior to the commencement of the hearing. Any party who wishes to address the board through his or her attorney or other designated representative or agent shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the board prior to the commencement of the hearing, setting forth the name of their principal and the capacity in which they are appearing before the board, i.e. whether as attorney, parent, attorney in fact, real estate agent or otherwise.
4.
The board chair will cause to be read the proposed zoning decision under consideration and any departmental reviews pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input on said proposed zoning decision. Proposed zoning decisions shall as a general rule be called in the order in which they are received by the board, provided that nothing shall prevent the board from changing the order of decisions reviewed at the time of hearing for the convenience of the board and the public.
5.
The board chair shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the proposed zoning decision in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except for the applicant, who will always speak first. If the board has brought a proposed zoning decision to the hearing, then the commissioners shall speak first. Proponents and opponents of each zoning decision shall have ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion. The applicant may use all of the time in the initial presentation, or may choose to reserve any remaining time for rebuttal. If the board in its discretion allows either the proponents or opponents to exceed the allotted time, the other side shall be granted equal time. If a number of speakers wish to speak, they must decide among themselves how to allocate the ten minutes per side. The time shall be kept by the clerk or other staff designated by the board.
6.
Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed zoning decision under consideration and shall address his or her remarks only to the board. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed zoning decision under consideration. The board may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection.
7.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the board from taking reasonable steps necessary to ensure that hearings are conducted in a decorous manner, to ensure that the public hearing on each proposed zoning decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
8.
Prior to the close of the hearing, the board shall announce whether it will vote on the proposed amendment or decision at that same hearing or whether it will defer its vote.
9.
Any person desiring a transcript of the hearing must arrange for a court reporter at their own expense.
10.
Cross examination of persons making oral presentations will not be permitted.
11.
All questions will be addressed to the chairman of the board of commissioners.
L.
After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners may approve or deny the requested amendment, reduce the land area for which the amendment is requested, change the district or land use category requested, or impose conditions which may restrict the use or development of the property in a manner not otherwise required by this zoning ordinance. Any such conditions imposed by the board of commissioners shall be incorporated into this zoning ordinance and shall become a part of the official zoning map, whether or not actually entered upon the official zoning map.
M.
If the board of commissioners denies a proposed amendment to change a zoning district, no amendment to the zoning district as it applies to that property may be again filed with the zoning administrator until at least six months following the denial by the board of commissioners.
