--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of Sept. 22, 2009(1) amended former Art. 10, §§ 1001—1005, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. 10 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. (2) of Nov. 9, 2004, § 19.

Sec. 1001. - Purpose.
This zoning district is intended to provide standards and regulations for manufactured home parks, recreational vehicle parks, and campgrounds, which provide for affordable permanent and temporary housing and seasonal recreational developments, respectively. Manufactured home parks provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured homes, owned or rented by tenants. This zoning district also provides for planned residential communities in the form of parks, campgrounds, camp sites, and spaces. A manufactured home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual spaces for manufactured homes or spaces or campsites for recreational vehicles are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home or vehicle space, manufactured home parks are built at densities greater than those for detached dwellings. Service facilities such as laundry and leasing office are often planned and provided as a part of the park development.
It is also the intent of this article to provide for the creation of new and expansion or modification of existing recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds in unincorporated areas of Screven County that meet the needs and protect the interests of users, the recreational vehicle industry, and adjacent landowners. To assure the compatibility of planned manufactured home communities, recreational vehicle parks, and campgrounds with adjacent and nearby land uses, this article establishes development standards while providing for flexible designs.

Sec. 1003. - Development standards for PMHC districts.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the development standards of this section shall apply to all permitted uses. No permitted use shall be permitted until and unless a major development plan shall have been approved by the planning commission and the zoning administrator in accordance with section 66-111(b) of the Screven County Land Development Regulations. The zoning administrator shall not issue a permit for a use permitted in a PMHC zoning district unless it is in conformity with all the provisions of this article. The standards in this section shall not apply to recreational vehicle parks designed to serve and serving three or less vehicles.
1.
Site conditions. Planned manufactured home communities shall be sited on land that is not subject to hazards such as flooding, erosion, land subsidence, and areas with possible insect or rodent infestation. Recreational vehicle parks should observe similar site condition limitations. The condition of the soil, ground water level, drainage, rock formations, and topography must be appropriate for the use, to ensure that no hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants occurs.
2.
Site planning. Planning for manufactured home communities and recreational vehicle parks should be adapted to individual site conditions and the type of use or uses served, reflect advances in site planning techniques, and be adapted to the trends in the design of the manufactured home or recreational vehicle itself. Site planning and improvements shall provide for facilities and amenities appropriate to the needs of the occupants, safe, comfortable and sanitary use by the occupants under all weather conditions, and practical and efficient operation and maintenance of all facilities at reasonable costs. The street and block pattern for the community or park shall be designed to attain proper sizes and shapes of manufactured home and/or recreational vehicle spaces so as to provide desirable areas and to reduce excessive length of street construction without impairing convenient circulation and access.
3.
Minimum site area, site frontage, access, and minimum width. Planned manufactured home communities shall contain a minimum area of five acres. Properties containing planned manufactured home communities shall have a minimum of 200 feet of property frontage on a public street, and directly access the public street with a minimum of 200 feet of property frontage. Planned manufactured home communities shall have a minimum lot width of 200 feet throughout the entire depth of the developed portion of the property. Recreational vehicle parks are not subject to the standards of this paragraph.
4.
Perimeter buffer or landscape screen. A minimum 20-foot wide buffer, where natural vegetation exists and provides a more or less opaque screen, or where no natural vegetation forming an opaque screen exists, a minimum 20-foot wide landscape strip with evergreen trees that will grow to a height of at least six feet within three years, shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of a planned manufactured home community, except for approved access and utility crossings. Buffers for recreational vehicle parks shall be as determined by the planning and zoning commission on a case by case basis.
5.
Open space and recreational areas. A planned manufactured home community serving 20 or more dwellings, and for recreational vehicle parks serving 30 or more vehicles, there shall be a minimum of 20 percent of the site area dedicated to open space and passive or active recreation, including the required perimeter buffer or landscape screen.
6.
Community services. As part of the development plan review process, the developer may propose and the county may approve one or more other structures for manufactured home or recreational vehicle occupants, such as laundries, storage, garages, and a park leasing or management office. Any structure that draws its trade from outside the park boundaries is prohibited.
