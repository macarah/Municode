ARTICLE 16. - SP - SPECIAL PRESERVATION DISTRICT[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— An Ord. of Nov. 9, 2004 repealed former article 16, §§ 1601, 1602, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former art. 16 pertained to the CP - conservation preservation district and derived from zoning ordinance of Oct. 27, 1998.

Sec. 1601. - Purpose.
The special preservation district is established to provide for the proper placement of private, semiprivate and public uses, which require special consideration because of their character, physical setting, size and/or relation to surrounding land uses. This district consist of lands that are located along major rivers, creeks and streams or other areas as determined by the planning commission and involve environmental sensitive areas that are best served by requiring minimum development standards to help protect the natural environment, reduce flood damage, improve water runoff quality and minimize increased flood velocity. It is the intent of this district to provide standards that allow desirable land uses while protecting our natural resources that are not served by the county road system.
The provisions of this district shall take precedence over any conflicts or requirements of other ordinances relating to subdivisions as adopted by the county.
This district is designed for low-density development with low traffic volumes. It is not the intent or desire of the county to own, develop, or accept roads that are in a floodplain or environmental sensitive areas associated with this special district. Therefore, the county will require that all roads providing ingress and egress to be privately owned and maintained in these sensitive and floodprone areas.
