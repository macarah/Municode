Chapter 16 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 16-1. - Location of flood plain area.
This chapter shall apply to all areas located within the 100-year flood plains as delineated by the most current Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), as updated by the FEMA Flood Map Service Center and incorporated by reference herein, to the extent said areas fall within the geographical confines of the city as well as within the city's respective service area.
(Ord. of 8-20-1997, § 1)
Sec. 16-2. - Conflict regarding location of flood plain areas.
Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the area to which this chapter applies (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between the mapped boundary and actual physical conditions), the mayor shall make the necessary interpretation.
(Ord. of 8-20-1997, § 2)
Sec. 16-3. - Restrictions.
(a)
This chapter shall prevent any development by any person, firm, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity, within the 100-year flood plains.
(b)
This chapter is not intended to repeal any prior enactment adopting flood hazard boundaries insofar as such enactments are more stringent as to the requirements of flood plain boundaries. In case of conflict within prior enactments, or state or federal rules, regulations, or flood plain boundaries, the most stringent requirement shall govern.
(Ord. of 8-20-1997, § 3)
Sec. 16-4. - Statutory authorization.
The state legislature has, in the city, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. of 3-26-1993, § 1(A))
Sec. 16-5. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. of 3-26-1993, § 1(B))
Sec. 16-6. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. of 3-26-1993, § 1(C))
Sec. 16-7. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. of 3-26-1993, § 1(D))

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Addition to an existing building means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the city's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1)
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
(2)
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means the official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building, including basement (i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction). The term "floor" does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles.
Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term "functionally dependent facility" does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
Mean sea level (MSL) means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide and is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L-97-348), means and includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of manufactured home of a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either, before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

ARTICLE. IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 16-96. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
Anchoring.
a.
New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
b.
Manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(2)
Construction materials and methods.
a.
New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
b.
New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
c.
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
(3)
Utilities.
a.
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
b.
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
c.
Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(4)
Subdivision proposals.
a.
Subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
b.
Subdivision proposals shall have public utilities facilities, such as sewer, gas, electric and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

Subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
d.
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
(5)
Encroachments. The cumulative effect of any proposed development shall not adversely affect the area of special flood hazard. This determination is to be made in accordance with section 16-72(3).
(Ord. of 3-26-1993, § 5(A))
Sec. 16-97. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data or floodway data has been provided as set forth in section 16-73, the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 16-74(2).
(3)
Floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge:
b.
If subsection (3)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes and mobile homes, except in an existing manufactured home and mobile home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring standards of section 16-96(1), and the elevation standards of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, and the encroachment standards of subsection (3)a of this section are met.
