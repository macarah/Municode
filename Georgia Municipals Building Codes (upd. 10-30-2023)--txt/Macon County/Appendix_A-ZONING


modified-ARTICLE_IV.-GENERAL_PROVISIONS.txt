A modification of the following standards shall be permitted only if: (a) there are special and unusual topographic conditions unique to the property or structure; or (b) The proposed use is clearly of such a small scale, and will remain at such small scale that conducting or operating the business would not be obvious or noticeable from the adjoining property or by the public in general; and (c) If the intent of the rural business is maintained.
