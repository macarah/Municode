Does the proposed zoning classification promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of Macon County?

The existing uses of the subject property and adjacent and near properties.

The current zoning of the subject property and adjacent or near properties.
4.
The extent to which property values are diminished by the present zoning restriction.
5.
The extent to which the restrictions diminishing the property's value promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the public.
6.
The relative gain to the public compared to the extent of hardship imposed upon the individual property owner (in retaining the current zoning designation).
7.
The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes.
8.
The history of the use of the subject property considered in the context of land developments in the vicinity of the property.
9.
Conformity with the Macon County Future Land Use Plan.
Sec. 12. - Conditional Uses.

The Zoning Commission may recommend to the Board of Commissioners approval of a petition to rezone provided the applicant agrees to certain specified conditions related to the proposed rezoning. The Board of Commissioners will make the final decision. The procedures and application process are the same as in Section 10—Procedures for Rezoning Request by a Citizen or Property Owner. The sign posted on-site of the subject property shall include any conditions, requirements or limitations deemed by the Zoning Commission to be necessary for protection of adjacent properties and the community as a whole and to carry out provisions of this ordinance.
***Approval of all Conditional Uses requests must be formally approved by the Macon County Board of Commissioners.
Sec. 13. - Criteria for the Review of Conditional Uses.
new
An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the Zoning Commission and a determination by the Macon County Board of Commissioners that:
1.
The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose(s) of this ordinance;
2.
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood, nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers;
3.
The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noises or fumes generation or type of physical activity; however, as noted in Article IV, Sections 1 and 4, some odors, noise, etc. is inherent in agricultural activities, and this ordinance is intended to promote the continuance of a healthy agribusiness presence in the county. To assist in determining whether or not a proposed use is a significant nuisance, the Zoning Commission should take into consideration whether or not the applicant has been in compliance with published Best Management Practices for the activity considered. Strict conformance to applicable BMPs should be recognized as adequate measures in most cases to offset nuisance concerns.
4.
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use;
5.
Parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted have been met; and
6.
Provided, the Board of Commissioners may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood, provided that, wherever the County Commission shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that any term, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said Commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.

a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; or

The application of the Ordinance to the particular property would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; or

Sec. 16. - Criteria for the Consideration of Variance Requests.
new
The following criteria shall be utilized when considering request for variance from the terms of the ordinance, when approval of such will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, yet maintain the spirit of this ordinance and preserve and secure the public safety and welfare. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding of the Zoning Commission that:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question and because of its size, shape or topography;
2.
Strict application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an undue hardship, (e.g. locating a newly required livestock or poultry waste treatment facility in reasonable proximity to a dairy or poultry operation; and
3.
Such conditions are particular to the particular piece of property involved and not the making of the applicant; and
4.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good, or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance; and
5.
The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood; and
6.
The proposed use will be of a nature that vehicular and pedestrian traffic will be no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved; and
7.
The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible nuisance (dust, noises, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights, etc.) emanating from the use which might be noxious to the occupants of other nearby uses; and
8.
The location and height of buildings or structures and the location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage appropriate development and the use of adjacent land and buildings, or unreasonably affect their value.

Such appeals shall be made within thirty (30) days of the administrative action by filing with the Macon County Clerk a Notice of Appeal specifying the grounds thereof. If the Notice of Appeal is not filed within the thirty (30) days, the only recourse shall be a court of record.
2.
The County Clerk shall then transmit to the Board of Commissioners all papers constituting the record upon which the appeal was taken. The appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Commissioners after the Notice of Appeals has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the Notice, a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record.
3.
The Board of Commissioners shall fix a reasonable amount of time for the hearing of an appeal and shall give due notice to the parties concerned, including all landowners within three hundred (300) feet of the site in question. Such notice shall be delivered personally or by mail, addressed to the respective owners at the address given on the last assessment roll. The Board of Commissioners shall decide the appeal within a reasonable period of time with regard to the purposes of the ordinance. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or through their agent.
