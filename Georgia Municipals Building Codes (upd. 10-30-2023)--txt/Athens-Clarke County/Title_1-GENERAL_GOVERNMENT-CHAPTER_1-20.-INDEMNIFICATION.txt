(a)
General indemnification. The Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County will undertake to defend elected and appointed officials, along with employees of said government, against actions arising out of the performance of their duties. Such legal actions include but are not limited to, negligence, violation of contract rights, violation of civil, constitutional, common law, statutory rights, torts or liability claims.
(b)
Exclusion of indemnification. This subsection in no way authorizes the Unified Government to furnish a defense to any person charged with a criminal offense involving theft, embezzlement or other like crimes with respect to monetary or property interests of the government.
(c)
Payment of judgments. Athens-Clarke County will pay the amount of any judgement rendered against any appointed or elected official or employee whose defense Athens-Clarke County is authorized to undertake under this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no judgement against said official or employee shall be paid which arises out of a claim or claims for sexual harassment unless the mayor and commission determine that the court which issued the judgement was in error in doing so. Any distribution shall be deemed to be made for public purposes and may be paid from federal, state or local funds.
(d)
Construction. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow into evidence at a trial of any action brought against a person covered by this code section the fact that Athens-Clarke County will be responsible for payment of any judgement levied by the court.
