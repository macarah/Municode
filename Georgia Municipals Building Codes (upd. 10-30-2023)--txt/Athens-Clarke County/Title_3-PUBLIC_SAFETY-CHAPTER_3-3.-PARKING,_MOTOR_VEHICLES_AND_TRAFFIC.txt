A demand for a bench trial made by telephone shall be valid only if the demand is made directly to a person receiving such call in real time and only if Athens-Clarke County or its authorized agent confirms such trial demand in writing to the caller. A demand may not be made by use of telephone answering machines. A date for such trial will be assigned upon receipt of the demand;
e.
A statement that the subject vehicle is subject to immobilization by wheel lock device or by towing and impoundment for accumulated unpaid parking violation notices unless (i) the registered owner or other responsible party pays in full the unpaid amounts for all of the civil penalties described in the notice on or before the specified court appearance date, or (ii) the registered owner or other responsible party appears personally in Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court to demand a bench trial in which to contest such immobilization or towing and impoundment.
(3)
If the registered owner or other responsible party fails to: (i) pay in full all unpaid penalties associated with the violations described in the notice of pending immobilization or towing and impoundment no later than the court date specified in the notice, or (ii) appear personally in Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court on or before the date and time specified in the notice to contest such immobilization or towing and impoundment, the vehicle subject to the notice may thereafter without further notice be immobilized by wheel lock device or towed and impounded.

Such notice shall either be filed in person at the office of the Clerk of Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court, or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, in either case no later than 30 days following the release from impoundment of his or her vehicle. Only requests for reimbursement of immobilization or towing and impoundment fees meeting the requirements of this section shall be adjudicated by the Administrative Hearing Officer. If the Administrative Hearing Officer finds in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1-5-1 of this Code that the immobilization or the towing and impoundment was not authorized or that the provisions of this Code were not followed, he or she shall issue an order for reimbursement. Such reimbursement shall be limited to the fees actually paid for release of the subject vehicle from impoundment, plus certified mailing fees, if any.

It shall be unlawful for a vehicle immobilization service or service operator to fail to arrive on the site where the vehicle was immobilized within 30 minutes of being contacted by the owner, driver or person in charge of the vehicle.
(7)
It shall also be unlawful for either a vehicle immobilization service or a service operator to fail to immediately release vehicles from immobilization after receipt of payment of the fee for removal from the owner, driver or person in charge of a vehicle that has been immobilized by a vehicle immobilization device. It shall be a defense to this subsection if the immediate release cannot be achieved due to a mechanical failure of the device that is outside the control of the vehicle immobilization service or service operator.

(11)
In the event that the owner or operator of a vehicle, to which an immobilization device has been applied, attempts to operate said vehicle or remove the device, then the vehicle immobilization service is not liable for any damage to that vehicle. Additionally, the driver or person in charge of the vehicle will be liable to the vehicle immobilization service for the cost of damage to the vehicle immobilization device where the device is rendered unusable; mere cosmetic damage to the device shall not impose liability for the purposes of this section. However, liability may not be imposed when the immobilization device is not readily visible to the driver of the vehicle and/or the sticker notice has not been properly affixed to the rear-most portion of the window adjacent to the driver's seat of the vehicle or other location where the sticker is immediately and reasonably visible to the operator of the vehicle. This subsection shall not be construed to create the right to collect for damage to any immobilization device at the time of the immobilization, and it shall be unlawful to require payment for any such damage as a prerequisite to removal of the immobilization device.
(12)
No release or waiver of any kind purporting to limit or avoid liability for damages to a vehicle that has been booted shall be valid.

(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance shall be to prohibit Shareable Dockless Mobility Devices from being placed in the public right-of-way or on public property, operated in the public right-of-way or on public property, or offered for use anywhere in Athens-Clarke County.
(b)
Definitions. For purposes of this ordinance, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivatives shall have the meanings set forth in this section.
(1)
Shareable dockless mobility device means any dockless wheeled device, whether it be human-powered, electric, or otherwise motorized, that permits an individual to move or be moved freely, which shall include but not be limited to e-scooters and Class II or Class III electric assisted bicycles and shall exclude bicycles and Class I electric assisted bicycles as defined in section 3-10-4; is accessed via an on-demand portal, whether a smartphone application, membership card, or similar method; is operated by a private entity that owns, manages, and maintains devices for shared use by members of the public; and is available to members of the public in unstaffed, self-service locations.
(2)
Dockless means that the device does not require the individual user to return and lock the device to an authorized fixed station once the user has completed their use of the device.
(c)
General requirements. It is unlawful to park, leave standing, leave lying, abandon, or otherwise place a shareable dockless mobility device in a public right-of-way or on public property anywhere within Athens-Clarke County. It is unlawful to operate a shareable dockless mobility device in a public right-of-way or on public property anywhere within Athens-Clarke County. It is unlawful to provide or offer for use a shareable dockless mobility device anywhere within Athens-Clarke County.
(d)
Notice. Notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the registered agents of any and all companies currently operating shareable dockless mobility devices within Athens-Clarke County upon the adoption of this ordinance. Said companies shall be given ten days to remove all shareable dockless mobility devices, after which, any such devices found in the public right-of-way or on public property shall be in violation of this ordinance.
(e)
Violations; impoundment. Violations of this ordinance shall be punishable as provided for in Title 1, Chapter 1, Section 1-1-5 of this Code. Police officers, parking enforcement officers, code enforcement officers, those county officials otherwise designated by the Manager, and any party contracted by the Athens-Clarke County to specifically impound shareable dockless mobility devices are authorized to impound any shareable dockless mobility device that has been offered for use, placed in a public right-of-way or on public property, or operated in a public right-of-way or on public property in violation of this ordinance. The impoundment shall be subject to an initial impound fee of $40.00 and a daily storage and administration fee, as applicable, of $5.00.
(1)
Once a shareable dockless mobility device has been impounded as provided for in subsection (e), Athens-Clarke County or a designated officer shall make a good-faith attempt to determine the name and address of the owner of such device by serial number, vehicle identification number (VIN), or such other means as are reasonably ascertainable through inspection of the exterior of such device. In those cases where the name and address of the owner of the subject vehicle are determined, written notice shall be sent to said owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service acknowledged by signature of the registered owner or other responsible party. Notice by certified mail as described herein shall be deemed given as of the postmark date. The written notice required by this section shall contain the following:
a.
A description of the subject vehicle, including serial numbers, vehicle identification number, or other identifying information;
b.
The name and address of the owner of such vehicle;
c.
The dates and descriptions of the parking violations that establish the grounds for impoundment, the unpaid amounts of the civil penalties for each violation, and the process by which the device(s) may be reclaimed. A copy of each parking ticket or other document providing the required information attached to the notice shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. Where multiple devices owned by the same company are impounded on a single day, a single notice listing all impounded devices is sufficient;
d.
A date and time at least seven days from the postmark date of the notice in which the registered owner or other responsible party may appear in Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court to demand a bench trial to contest the impoundment.
(2)
Vehicles towed and impounded under subsection (e) may be released from such impoundment only upon payment in full of all impound and storage fees accrued. After paying such fees, a registered owner or other responsible person may contest the validity of the towing and impoundment of his or her vehicle by submitting in writing a Request for Reimbursement of Towing and Impoundment Fees to the Athens-Clarke County Administrative Hearing Officer on a form available from the Clerk of the Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court. Such notice shall either be filed in person at the office of the Clerk of Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court, or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, in either case no later than 30 days following the release from impoundment of his or her vehicle. Only requests for reimbursement of impoundment fees meeting the requirements of this section shall be adjudicated by the Administrative Hearing Officer. If the administrative hearing officer finds in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 1-5-1 of this Code that the towing and impoundment was not authorized or that the provisions of this Code were not followed, he or she shall issue an order for reimbursement. Such reimbursement shall be limited to the fees actually paid for release of the subject vehicle from impoundment, plus certified mailing fees, if any.
(3)
Shareable dockless mobility devices that are not reclaimed within 120 days of impound pursuant to the procedures outlined in subparagraph (2) shall be deemed at that time to be abandoned and discarded by the owner thereof and shall thereafter be disposed of pursuant to written policies established by the Manager.
