PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of this Code were ordinances adopted by the commission through April, 1992. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been arranged in the order designated by the Unified Government and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
Chapter and Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of three component parts separated by dashes, the first figure referring to the title number, the second figure referring to the chapter number and the third figure referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1-4 is number 1-4-1 and the third section of chapter 1-7 is 1-7-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole titles or chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-1-8 and 1-1-9 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1-8.1, 1-1-8.2 and 1-1-8.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 3-3 and 3-4, it will be designated as chapter 3-3.5. New titles, articles and divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of James Thompson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
