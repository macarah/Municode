Replacement of street trees. Existing street trees removed by development projects shall be replaced by the developer with those from the Athens-Clarke County Tree Species List.
I.
Standards for subdivisions requiring site review. In addition to the building design standards contained in this section, subdivisions shall comply with the following standards:
1.
Lot coverage standards of the zone shall be complied with. In the case of developments which have actual building footprints, lot coverage shall be calculated using the footprint of the buildings and the impervious area of other improvements, including streets, driveways, and sidewalks. If building envelopes are provided, impervious area shall be calculated assuming that the building footprint is one-third the area of the building envelope, or 2,500 square feet, whichever is smaller.
2.
The development of the subdivision shall incorporate the natural features of the land to the extent practical, including topography, important stands of trees, streams, wetlands, ponds, and other areas. Open space areas shall incorporate these features where feasible, or they shall be protected by conservation easements, or other suitable means of protection of the natural features of the land.
J.
Athens-Clarke County corridor designations. The following chart identifies corridor types for specific streets and street sections within Athens-Clarke County. All other streets within Athens-Clarke County are considered as "undesignated corridors." Corridors designated as Level One or Level Two are subject to additional building mass standards in order to encourage pedestrian accessibility and to reinforce the relationship between the built environment and the adjacent major transportation corridors. Corridors not in the "C-D" zone and not designated shall follow design guidelines that typically result in less restrictive building mass requirements.
