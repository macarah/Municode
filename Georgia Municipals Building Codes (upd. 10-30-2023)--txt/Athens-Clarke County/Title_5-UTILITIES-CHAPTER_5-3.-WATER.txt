(e)
Method of calculation of cost to be assessed per parcel. For each project, the commission shall establish by ordinance an assessment method from among the methods set forth below which will most accurately assess each lot or parcel of land according to the benefit conferred upon it by the project. Assessments per parcel of land for the total costs of the water line extension may be made on the basis of the following as determined by the commission for each project:
(1)
The property frontage abutting on the project, by dividing the total cost of the construction by the total frontage abutting the construction to ascertain the cost per front foot and assessing each lot or parcel of abutting property according to its frontage on construction at an equal rate per foot of frontage, exclusive of connection fees;
(2)
The area of land served, or subject to being served, by the project, at an equal rate per unit of area; or
(3)
The number of lots served, or subject to being served, where the project involves extension of an existing system to a residential or commercial subdivision, at an equal rate per lot calculated by dividing the total cost of the project by the total number of parcels benefited by the project. In the event that the lots to be served include existing multifamily housing or platted subdivisions not yet built, then "lots" as used in this subpart (3) shall include said unbuilt subdivision lots or said existing multifamily housing with each multifamily dwelling unit counted as a lot.
(f)
Authority of commission for improvements not petitioned for. The commission may assess the pro rata costs of improvements provided for herein upon each parcel of real property abutting the improvement solely within its discretion and in the absence of an abutting landowner's signature on the petition for the improvements.
(g)
Ordinance and notice of hearing. The construction of each project and the assessment for the construction shall be provided for by ordinance. Athens-Clarke County shall cause a legal notice to be published in the legal organ of Athens-Clarke County, at least ten days before and not more than 45 days from a public hearing, stating the time and place of such hearing concerning the adoption of an ordinance providing for a water line extension as defined above. The notice shall contain a project description of the proposed water line extension, including the parcels to be benefited and a statement of the general character, material, size and total cost of the water line. The hearing shall be for the purpose of receiving and considering the recommendation of the public utilities department and public comment on the merits of the proposed water line project. The ordinance may be adopted at the next meeting after the notice has been published. Substantial compliance with this section as to notice shall be sufficient.
(h)
Deferred or installment payments; execution of special assessments. The director of public utilities is authorized, upon commission authorization for the work, to accept application and payment from property owners assessed for the water line extension and to permit deferred or installment payments for the assessed costs plus interest at an interest rate based on prevailing rates, as set forth in the project ordinance per annum over a period not to exceed ten years of any owner of property abutting the water line extension. Such installment payments for costs of the water line extension shall be in the name of the property owner applying for installment payments, shall be non-assignable, and shall be billed to said property owner by the Clarke County tax commissioner. The installment account shall be paid in full, including earned interest, at the time of any transfer of ownership of the property.
In addition, pursuant to the Charter of Athens-Clarke County section 8-106, whenever any special assessment imposed by this chapter is not paid within the time periods provided for herein, then the manager or his lawful designee the Clarke County tax commissioner as ex-officio marshal shall issue execution against such person, firm, or entity liable therefor or property subject thereto for such sums as may be due with interest at the legal rate for county taxes from due date, and costs. The unified government shall have the right to enforce payment of such execution by levy and sale as in the case of county taxes, and the purchaser at such sale shall acquire the same title and rights as a purchaser at a sale for county taxes. Executions issued hereunder, and the levy and sale thereunder shall be governed by general law.
(i)
Completion of work; lien on property abutting water line extension. The director of public utilities shall notify the tax commissioner of the completion of any water lines which constitute a lien against abutting property, and this information shall be recorded and maintained in the records of the tax commissioner and available for public inspection in the office of the tax commissioner. The lien shall be effective in the same manner as provided for liens for county taxes. A notice of lien for special assessments shall be filed in the real estate records of the clerk of superior court of Athens-Clarke County. Said notice shall also state that the lien must be paid in full at the time of any transfer in ownership of the property. The date of entry of the completed work shall be deemed the date when the lien attaches to the abutting property.
(Ord. of 10-2-2001, § 1; Ord. of 5-1-2012, § 1)

(b)
Method of calculation of cost to be assessed per parcel.

Assessments per parcel of land for the total costs, or a cost not to exceed, for the water line installation may be made on the basis of the following as determined by the commission for each project:
(1)
The property frontage abutting on the project, by dividing the total cost of the project by the total frontage abutting the project to ascertain the cost per front foot and assessing each lot or parcel of abutting property according to its frontage on the project at an equal rate per foot of frontage, exclusive of connection fees;
(2)
The area of land served, or subject to being served, by the project, at an equal rate per unit of area; or
(3)
The number of lots served, or subject to being served, where the project involves a residential or commercial subdivision, at an equal rate per lot calculated by dividing the total cost of the project by the total number of parcels benefited by the project. In the event that the lots to be served include multifamily housing or platted subdivisions not yet built, then "lots" as used in this subpart (3) shall include said unbuilt subdivision lots or said multifamily housing with each multifamily dwelling unit counted as a lot.

The hearing shall be for the purpose of receiving and considering the recommendation of the Public Utilities Department and public comment on the merits of the proposed water line project. The ordinance may be adopted at the next meeting after the notice has been published. Substantial compliance with this section as to notice shall be sufficient.
(d)
The Director of Public Utilities shall file an Affidavit of Special Assessment Area in the real estate records of Athens-Clarke County to provide notice of the special assessment on the subject property.
(e)
The assessment shall not be payable until an owner of a lot of record within the assessment area applies for water service, at which time the per parcel assessment with any applicable interest thereon shall be paid in full as a condition of provision of water service to the parcel. The Director of Public Utilities is authorized to provide for interest on the assessed amount per parcel based on prevailing interest rates, as set forth in the project ordinance per annum from the time of acceptance of the project by the Public Utilities Department to the time of application for water service.

Emergency Drought and Water Shortage Management Plan (EDWSMP). Athens-Clarke County Unified Government may seek targeted reductions in water usage through an EDWSMP in addition to reductions resulting from implementation of levels 1 through 3, inclusive. The director of public utilities and the manager may recommend a required reduction of water usage by some or all of the categories of water users in the following order of priority, as listed in the order given below from the highest priority of use to the lowest priority of use:
1 st  Medical and emergency facilities and emergency purposes such as fire suppression, and the use of water to satisfy federal, state, and local public health and safety requirements;
2 nd  Domestic and personal uses including drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary and health related uses and uses necessary to sustain domestic and livestock animals and personal food gardens;
3 rd  Commercial, industrial, and institutional uses;
4 th  Refilling of ponds which existed prior to the declared drought, and only to the level necessary to maintain aquatic life within the pond prior to the declared drought. Also, hand watering of non-lawn turf landscape plants and watering of golf course tee boxes and putting greens;
5 th  Uses such as lawn sprinkling (spray irrigation), irrigation of recreational/athletic fields and golf course fairways;
6 th  Uses that do not sustain plant, animal, or human life, health or well being and/or directly support established ongoing commercial, industrial, or institutional activities. Such uses include non-commercial and fund-raising car washing, filling of decorative water features, public fountains, water slides, wading pools, and topping off public and private swimming pools.
The targeted reductions may differ across the categories. An EDWSMP may state a maximum allowed usage volume and implementation schedule if such is consistent with the State of Georgia's numeric water usage reduction requirements per EPD Rule 391-3-30-.07(4)(e) or if included in a variance issued by the State of Georgia. The EDWSMP may then be approved by the Mayor to take immediate effect and ratified or modified by the Commission at its next regular business meeting or at a special called meeting.

ARTICLE 7. - WATER CONSERVATION

Sec. 5-3-120. - Purpose and policy.
The implementation of Athens-Clarke County's comprehensive water conservation program serves two main purposes: to optimize the effective use of this essential natural resource and to decrease the amount of water used overall. Water conservation is not just for times of drought or water shortage. It is something citizens should do every day. Sound water use practices reduce the amount of stress placed on vital resources, both by limiting water withdrawals and by decreasing wastewater discharges. Conserving water reduces wear and tear on major infrastructure such as water and wastewater treatment plants and the distribution and collection systems that deliver water and collect wastewater, and can postpone or eliminate the need for making major investments in new infrastructure. Consistently using less water helps provide for greater flexibility and more alternatives during times when there is a water shortage.
