(a)
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all publication racks located on public sidewalks in certain locations designated "special publication rack areas" of Athens-Clarke County.

(c)
The public health, safety, welfare and convenience require that interference with vehicular, bicycle, wheelchair or pedestrian traffic be avoided; obstruction of sight distance and views of traffic signs and street-crossing pedestrians be eliminated; damage done to sidewalks or streets be minimized and repaired; the good appearance of public property be maintained; trees and other landscaping be allowed to grow without disturbance; access to emergency and other public facilities be maintained; and ingress and egress from, and the enjoyment of store window displays on, properties adjoining public property be protected.
(d)
The regulations on the time, place and manner of the placement, location and maintenance of publication racks set forth in this chapter are carefully tailored to ensure that the purposes stated in this section are implemented while still providing ample opportunities for the distribution of news to the public.

(Ord. of 12-2-2003, § 1)
Sec. 3-1-3. - Special publication rack areas designated.
(a)
The commission hereby finds that special circumstances require special design, placement and other standards for publication racks located in the following area(s) of Athens-Clarke County; and such areas are hereby designated as "special publication rack areas":
(1)
The downtown commercial area.
a.
The commission hereby designates as a special publication rack area the portion of the commercial downtown zoning district bounded by and including both sides of the following streets (hereinafter referred to as the "downtown commercial area"): Broad Street, Thomas Street, Dougherty Street, and Pulaski Street, as shown on Attachment A hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
b.
The Commission finds that the downtown commercial area comprises the heart of the Athens-Clarke County business district and is one of the major transportation routes through Athens-Clarke County, as well as the tourist industry center for Athens-Clarke County. The importance of a commercially-thriving downtown has been recognized by the citizens of Athens-Clarke County by their support for downtown improvements funded by a special purpose local option sales tax. Infrastructure and aesthetic improvements to the downtown commercial area have been on-going during the Downtown Streetscape Project since 1998. Said downtown commercial area has become congested with street furniture and fixtures, such as publication racks, and other sidewalk encroachments competing with pedestrians for the public space, obstructing ingress and egress from properties adjoining the public rights-of-way, interfering with the good appearance of, and access to, public sidewalks and streets. The public investment in the landscaping and sidewalk improvements made in the Downtown Streetscape Project needs to be protected from damage by and the detrimental effects of unbridled proliferation of publication racks ungoverned by any criteria for placement or design throughout the downtown district. The need for special standards for placement of publication racks on sidewalks and other public rights-of-way is greatest in the downtown commercial area due to the greater frequency of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and publication rack locations in such area, compared to other parts of Athens-Clarke County. Special standards for the design and location of publication racks, and the enforcement of existing regulations for other sidewalk encroachments in the downtown commercial area, will help to create a sense of order out of chaos and provide a friendly, pleasing and safe environment for those who come to the area.
c.
The commission finds that the regulation of publication racks as set forth in this chapter provides the least intrusive and burdensome means for ensuring that the purposes stated in this chapter are carried out while still providing ample opportunities for the distribution of news and information to the citizens of Athens-Clarke County by means of publication racks located within public rights-of-way and public property in the downtown district.
(b)
The following special standards shall apply to publication racks and the placement of publications in publication racks within any special publication rack area so designated pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section:
(1)
No publication shall be placed in a publication rack located in a special publication rack area except within a publication rack permitted and provided by Athens-Clarke County in a publication rack module provided by Athens-Clarke County.
(2)
Original placement of publication racks within a special publication rack area.
a.
No publication rack shall be located in a special publication rack area unless a permit has been obtained in accordance with subsection b. or subsection c. below:
b.
Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance designating a special publication rack area, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the manager or manager's designee shall establish a date (the "cut-off date") by which application shall be made to the manager or manager's designee for use of a publication rack located within a special publication rack area. No application shall be considered that is filed later than the cut-off date established for that area. The manager or manager's designee shall give notice of the cut-off date by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in Athens-Clarke County. The manager or manager's designee shall also endeavor to mail notice of the cut-off date to the owners and/or distributors of publication racks existing as of the effective date of the ordinance designating a special publication rack area; provided, however, that failure to provide mailed notice to any person shall not invalidate any action taken pursuant to this section or this chapter.
c.
The process for obtaining a permit shall be in accordance with section 3-1-5, provided, that where the number of publication racks for which application has been made exceed the number of publication racks available in publication rack modules in a special publication rack area, or in a particular location within a special publication rack area, the manager or manager's designee shall issue publication rack permits in the manner described in procedures established by the manager or manager's designee and approved by the mayor and commission.
(3)
After the original placement of publication racks within a special publication rack area, as described in subparagraph (2) of this subsection (b), application may be made for use of a publication rack in a location within a special publication rack area for which no empty publication rack is available in a publication rack module. Such applications shall be placed on a waiting list. In the event a publication rack in a publication rack module becomes available, the manager or manager's designee shall issue a permit for that location to the applicant for the location, if there is only one applicant. In the case of multiple applicants for a single location, the manager or manager's designee shall determine which applicant shall receive the permit in the manner described in procedures established by the manager or manager's designee and approved by the commission.
(Ord. of 12-2-2003, § 1)
Sec. 3-1-4. - Permit required.
It is unlawful to install, place, maintain, use or cause to be placed, installed, maintained, or used a publication rack on, or projecting on, any public sidewalk located in a special publication rack area without first receiving a permit therefor from the manager or manager's designee and unless such publication rack is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. of 12-2-2003, § 1)

(1)
Within the next working day following removal, the manager or manager's designee shall notify by telephone the permittee or, in the case of an unpermitted publication rack, the owner of the publication rack or a person whose name is shown on the required identification.

(2)
Upon timely request, the manager or manager's designee shall provide a meeting within two working days of receipt of the request, unless the requesting party agrees to a later date. The proceeding shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. The manager or manager's designee shall give his or her decision in writing to the requesting party within 48 hours after such meeting. If the manager or manager's designee finds that the removal was proper, he or she shall notify the requesting party to pay any applicable penalties and costs and to recover the publication rack.
