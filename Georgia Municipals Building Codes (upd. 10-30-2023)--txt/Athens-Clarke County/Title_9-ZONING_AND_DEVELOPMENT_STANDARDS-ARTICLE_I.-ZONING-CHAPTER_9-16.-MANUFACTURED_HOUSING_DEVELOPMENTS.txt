(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-16-3. - Procedure for approval.
A.
Outline plan.
1.
Application for subdivision approval under this chapter shall be accompanied by a proposed outline plan. For developments of less than ten lots, the outline plan may be filed concurrently with the final plan, as that term is defined in 9-16-3(B)(4). However, for developments of ten lots or more a prior outline plan approval is mandatory.
2.
A Type IV procedure, as defined in this title, shall be used for the approval of the outline plan.
3.
Contents. The contents for an outline plan shall be as follows:
a.
A topographic map showing contour intervals of five feet.
b.
The proposed land uses and approximate locations of the existing buildings to be retained, the proposed structures on the site, the proposed and existing property lines and easements on the site, and existing buildings, structures, and trees greater than six inches in diameter measured at breast height on the properties adjacent to the site, and all buildings within 160 feet of the site boundaries.
c.
The locations of all proposed thoroughfares, walkways, and parking facilities.

d.
That the development of the land will not prevent adjacent land from being developed for the uses shown in the comprehensive plan.

5.
Approval of the outline plan.
a.
The hearings board may approve or disapprove the outline plan and application or require changes, or impose conditions of approval that it finds necessary to conform to the standards of this title and the purpose of this chapter. Approval of the outline plan and application, and conditions of approval are final to all issues resolved at that time unless appealed.
b.
After an outline plan, which has had a public hearing, is approved, the developer may then file a final plan in phases or in its entirety. However, a final plan may not be filed until the Athens-Clarke Mayor and Commission adopts any zone change necessary for the development.
c.
If an outline plan is phased, 50 percent of the value of the recreational amenities shall be provided in the first phase and all recreational amenities shall be provided when two-thirds of the units are finished.

5.
Criteria for final plan approval. Final plan approval shall be granted unless it is found that it fails to substantially conform to the outline plan, and conditions, previously approved. Nothing in this provision shall limit reduction in the number of dwelling units or increased open space provided that, if this is done for one phase, the number of dwelling units shall not be transferred to another phase, nor the open space reduced below that permitted in the outline plan. This substantial conformance provision is intended solely to facilitate the minor modifications from one planning step to another. Substantial conformance with reference to the matters below listed shall be deemed to exist when comparison of the outline plan with the final plan shows that:
a.
The number of dwelling units vary no more than ten percent of those shown on the approved outline plan, but in no case shall the number of units exceed those permitted in the outline plan.
b.
The yard depths and distances between main buildings vary no more than ten percent of those shown on the approved outline plan, but in no case shall these distances be reduced below the minimum established within this title.
c.
The open spaces vary no more than ten percent of that provided on the outline plan.
d.
The building size does not exceed the building size shown on the outline plan by more than ten percent.
e.
The building elevations and exterior materials are in conformance with the purpose and intent of this title and the approved outline plan.
f.
That the additional standards which resulted in the awarding of bonus points in the outline plan approval have been included in the final plan with substantial detail to ensure that the performance level committed to in the outline plan will be achieved.
6.
Any substantial amendment to an approved final plan shall follow a Type IV procedure and be reviewed in accordance with the above criteria.
