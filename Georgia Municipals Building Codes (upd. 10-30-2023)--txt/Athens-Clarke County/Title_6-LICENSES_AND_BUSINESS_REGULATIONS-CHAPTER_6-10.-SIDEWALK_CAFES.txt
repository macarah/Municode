Sidewalk café permit holders and applicants may request a variance review with the Administrative Hearing Officer to contest a staff ruling on sidewalk café design, spacing, or use. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon deliberation of the evidence and a finding by the Administrative Hearing Officer that:
(a)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular sidewalk café in question because of right-of-way, building or sidewalk size, shape, character, or topography that do not apply generally to other cafés in the vicinity; and
(b)
The strict application of the provisions of this title to this particular café would create an undue and unnecessary hardship so that the grant of the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a sidewalk café and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant; and
(c)
The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and
(d)
The variance, if granted, does not conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act; and
(e)
The benefits of granting the variance will be greater than any negative impacts and will further the purpose and intent of this title and the comprehensive plan of Athens-Clarke County.
(3)
No petition for the same variance involving the same applicant once heard and acted upon by the Administrative Hearing Officer shall be accepted for a rehearing until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the previous decision.
