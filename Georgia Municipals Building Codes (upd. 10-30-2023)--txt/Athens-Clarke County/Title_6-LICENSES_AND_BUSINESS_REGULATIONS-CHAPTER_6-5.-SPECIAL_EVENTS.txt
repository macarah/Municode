Prior to the issuance of a special events permit that utilizes a festival zone, the producer of a special event shall provide:
(a)
Evidence of their engagement with businesses adjacent and proximate to proposed festival zones as it relates to what is and is not permitted as a part of the festival zone.

Management
(a)
The event producer shall provide participants with wrist bands to identify persons who have presented proof of attaining the age of 21 years and who are authorized to purchase or hold in their possession beer and wine within the festival zone, both within and outside of licensed alcoholic beverage establishments; however, displaying such a uniquely identifiable wrist band does not relieve alcoholic beverage establishments of responsibility for determining if a person has attained the age of 21 years before dispensing alcohol to that person.

(f)
Only one special event may be permitted at a time per sponsor/person; festival zones will not be permitted on days when another special event is already permitted in the area and on UGA home football game days.
(g)
Unless otherwise permitted by state law, drinking alcohol in parked or moving motor vehicles is prohibited.
