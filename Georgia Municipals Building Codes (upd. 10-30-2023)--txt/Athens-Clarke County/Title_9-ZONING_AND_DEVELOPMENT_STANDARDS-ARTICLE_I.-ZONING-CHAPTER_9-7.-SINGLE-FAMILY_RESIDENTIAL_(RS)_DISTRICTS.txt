Sec. 9-7-4. - Density.
A.
Density, subdivisions of more than two acres. For subdivisions of more than two acres, density shall be calculated by multiplying the number of lots allowed by the adjusted development acreage. For subdivisions of two acres or less, the general regulations regarding lot dimensions set forth in Table 9-7-3 shall apply. For the purposes of this chapter, the following areas shall not be included in the adjusted development acreage.
1.
Land within the 100-year floodplain.
2.
Bodies of open water.
3.
Jurisdictional wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
4.
Land lying within the 100-foot or 75-foot riparian buffers identified on the Environmental Areas Map, and land lying within the state-mandated 25-foot riparian buffer.
5.
Areas with slopes equal to or greater than 25 percent which are at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area. These areas must remain undisturbed with the exception of easements for drainage access and underground utilities.
B.
Density bonus. The permitted base density shall be increased by the percentage gained through bonus points.
1.
The maximum bonus permitted shall be 25 percent.
2.
Provision of common open space. For developments of ten units or greater which provide greater than five percent open space, a one-percent bonus shall be awarded for each one percent of the total adjusted development acreage in common open space over the required five percent. The purpose of the density bonus for common open space is to permit areas that could otherwise be developed, or sold as individual lots, to be retained in their natural state or to be developed as a recreational amenity. It is not the purpose of this provision to permit density bonuses for incidental open spaces which have no realistic use by project residents on a day to day basis. No bonus points shall be awarded for the minimum five percent required open space of the adjusted development acreage, as specified in section 9-7-4 of this title.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 10-5-2004, § 1)
Sec. 9-7-5. - Design for individual ownership of units required.
All units developed in this zone shall be designed for individual ownership of each unit meeting the definition of "dwelling, single-family" or "dwelling, single-family attached", as defined in this title.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-7-6. - Open space.
Common open spaces may be provided in the form of natural areas, playgrounds, active or passive recreational areas, and similar areas in common ownership. All developments with a base density of ten units or greater shall be required to provide a minimum of five percent of the adjusted development acreage in open space that is not subject to bonus point calculations. Common open space set aside within the adjusted development acreage area shall count towards base density. A density bonus shall be awarded only to that open space area within the adjusted development acreage area in excess of five percent required for developments of ten units or greater. Open space shall be optional for all developments less than ten units.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 10-5-2004, § 1)
Sec. 9-7-7. - Grading and retaining walls.
A.
Grading. No grading resulting in a finished slope of more than three horizontal units to one vertical unit will be allowed in RS zone setbacks, unless pre-development grade exceeds three horizontal units to one vertical unit and the grading associated with the development will result in a slope reduction.
B.
Retaining walls. No retaining wall greater than four feet in height shall be located within any required setback. Retaining walls within five feet of any structure shall be included in the height calculation for the associated structure. The lowest point of the finished grade along the retaining wall shall be used to calculate the average finished grade for use in the associated height calculation.
( Ord. of 2-7-2017(2), § 4 )
