Sec. 2-190. - Manner of paying out monies.

Sec. 2-191. - Investments.
Management of monies not required immediately to pay operational expenses necessitates a definite investment policy. The town council and town clerk shall be responsible for developing and administrating, respectively, the town's investment policy, as set out in this section.
(1)
The purpose and objectives of this policy are to:
a.
Provide an investment medium for funds which may be needed for immediate liquidity purposes.
b.
Provide an investment medium for funds which are not needed for near-term liquidity purposes.
c.
Provide for funds with which to meet bond reserve requirements.
d.
Provide for a reasonable income to the town with little or no risk on the investment.
(2)
The town must rely on the expertise and advice of professional commercial and investment bankers for recommendations of proposed investments and investment strategies. The town council shall review and approve the banking institution with which the town is authorized to make investments.
(3)
Should more than $100,000.00 be invested with any one institution, the town shall require such institution to pledge assets sufficient to secure said investment.
(4)
At the first of each fiscal quarter, for every fund individually, the amount available for investment shall be determined by deducting monies required to meet operational expenses in the coming 90 days from the aggregate of cash-on-hand and projected revenues in such ensuing period. This amount shall be invested in two different categories. The first shall be secondary reserves to meet the liquidity demands of the town. These investments must be highly liquid in order that they may be turned into cash with little or no loss. These investments are usually bank money market accounts. The second category shall be somewhat longer-term investments, such as bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury obligations. All investments will be in conformance with applicable state law.
(5)
The maturity schedule on bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury obligations shall take into consideration the projected expenditures and revenues of the town. The annual budget shall be a major source document for making such projections.
(6)
The town council shall have a monthly report made available to it on all current investments of the town.
