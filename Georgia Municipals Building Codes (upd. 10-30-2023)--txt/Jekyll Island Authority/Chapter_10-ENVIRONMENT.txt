The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Artificial light or artificial lighting means the light emanating from any manufactured device.
Beach means the zone of sand from the low water mark of the ocean to the landward toe of the frontal dune. In cases with no identifiable frontal dune, beach means the zone of sand from the low-water mark of the ocean to the landward extent of sparsely vegetated sand.
Cumulatively illuminated means illuminated by more than one artificial light sources that collectively illuminate any portion of the beach.
Directly illuminated means an area illuminated as a result of glowing elements, lamps, globes or reflectors of an artificial light source, which is visible to an observer on the beach.
DNR means the Georgia Department of Natural Resources - Wildlife Resources Division which is responsible for conserving and protecting wildlife species, including sea turtles.
Dune means a natural or manmade mound or bluff of sand deposited along a coastline by wind action, which mounds are often covered with sparse, pioneer vegetation and are located landward of the ordinary high-water mark and may extend to the tree line.
Frontal dune means the seaward-most dune on the nesting beach and which has sufficient vegetation, height, continuity, and configuration to offer significant protective value of landward areas.
Ground-level barrier means any vegetation, natural feature or artificial structure rising from the ground, which obstructs beachfront lighting from illuminating the beach-dune system.
Hatchling means any species of marine turtle, within or outside of a nest that has recently hatched from an egg.
Indirectly illuminated means an area illuminated as a result of the glowing elements, tamps, globes or reflectors of an artificial light source, which is not visible to an observer on the beach.
Landward toe means the lowest elevation of the landward side of the frontal dune.
Nest means an area where sea turtle eggs have been naturally deposited or subsequently relocated.
Nesting beach means any beach capable of supporting sea turtle nests as determined by available data or any beach location where natural changes or engineered and permitted activities have created the potential for sea turtle nesting as determined by DNR. The authority may post a map of each year's nesting beaches on its website in advance of nesting season to identify the location of nesting beaches for that year's nesting season in consultation with DNR.
Nesting season means the period of time between May 1st and October 31st of each year. The authority, in consultation with DNR, may declare an end to the period of local regulation prior to October 31st of each year after the last remaining nest on Jekyll island has been inventoried pursuant to DNR's nesting protocols. Such a declaration would only apply to the beaches of Jekyll Island and pertain to this ordinance specifically.
Nighttime means the locally effective time period between sunset and sunrise.
Nonnesting beach means any beach that is not a nesting beach.
Person means any individual, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, or other legal entity, and all other groups or combinations thereof.
Private balcony means a balcony or porch that is not considered a point of ingress and egress in local building code.
Sea turtle (marine) means any marine-dwelling reptile of the families Cheloniidae or Dermocheiyidae found in state waters or using the beach as a nesting habitat, including the following species: Caretta caretta (loggerhead), Chelonia mydas (green), DermocheSys coriacea (leatherback), Eretmocheiys imbricatta (hawksbill), and Lepidochelys kempii (Kemp's Ridley). For purposes of this ordinance, sea turtle is synonymous with marine turtle.
Tinted glass means any glass treated to achieve an industry-specified, inside-to-outside light transmittance value of 45 percent or less. Such transmittance is limited to the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nanometers) and is measured as the percentage of light that is transmitted through the glass.
