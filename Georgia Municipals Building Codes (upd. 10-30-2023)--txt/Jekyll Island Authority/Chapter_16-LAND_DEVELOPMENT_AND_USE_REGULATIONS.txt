Establish locations and setbacks for signage which are designed to protect motorists from visual distractions, obstructions and hazards;
(4)
Enhance the appearance of the physical environment by requiring that signage be designed as an integral architectural feature of the site and structure to which such signage is intended to identify, and sited in a manner which is sensitive to the existing natural environment;
(5)
Provide for signage which satisfies the needs of the local business community for visibility, identification and communication;
(6)
Foster civic pride and community spirit by maximizing the positive impact of development;
(7)
Establish alternative provisions for structures within the Jekyll Island Historic District where demonstrated unique dimensional circumstances do not easily permit compliance with the general requirements of this article; and
