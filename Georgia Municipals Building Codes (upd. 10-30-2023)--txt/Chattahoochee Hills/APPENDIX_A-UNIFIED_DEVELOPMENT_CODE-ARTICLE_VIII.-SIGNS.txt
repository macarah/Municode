ARTICLE VIII. - SIGNS

Sec. 8-1. - Title.
This article shall hereafter be known and cited as the "City of Chattahoochee Hills Sign Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-2. - Purpose and findings.
A.
Purpose. This article was enacted with the following purposes:
1.
To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs;
2.
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
3.
To promote economic development;
4.
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs;
5.
To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city;
6.
To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare;
7.
To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs;
8.
To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and
9.
To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit.
B.
Findings.
1.
The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression, and are a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message.
2.
The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number, and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect public investment in thoroughfares, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing community compatible with its rural setting, to protect the natural environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens.
3.
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such signage as thoroughfare signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, the city's wayfinding program is a tool developed and maintained to control the visual appearance of public signage in order to safely communicate services and locations available to the traveling public. With the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from thoroughfare excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
4.
The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

A.
A development may submit a comprehensive sign plan to request special consideration of signs that are specifically integrated into the overall design of that development but which do not otherwise meet the requirements of this section. Because signage serves an important role in the overall site design and aesthetic, a comprehensive sign plan can create an effect both desired and unique that will enhance the overall environment of the development.
B.
It is not the intent of this section to be used to circumvent any purpose of this article. Prohibited types of signs may not be approved in a comprehensive sign plan, but alternate designs and sign areas may be approved where they are not visible from any pre-existing public thoroughfare or outside any area covered by a comprehensive sign plan.

3.
The planning commission may require special conditions on approved plans such as, but not limited to, bonds or other type of security to ensure the removal or abatement of signs that are abandoned or are in violation of any condition of an approved plan, or a time schedule for any sign program where signage is not considered permanent.
4.
An approved comprehensive sign plan may be changed or modified subject to the same process as a new application.
5.
The zoning administrator may grant minor changes to an approved comprehensive sign plan provided any such change does not alter the overall architectural design or style of signs approved by such plan, and there is no increase in the total area of signs.
F.
Future signs. A comprehensive sign plan may be approved where signs for outparcels or other such detached future buildings have not been identified and considered under such approved plan. In these instances, unless otherwise conditioned, such future signs shall be subject to the requirements of this article.
G.
Existing signs as part of a comprehensive sign plan. If any new or amended comprehensive sign plan is filed for property on which existing signs are located, those signs shall be integrated into the plan and shall be in compliance with that plan prior to issuance of a permit for any new sign permitted under said plan.

The plan shall be enforced in the same manner as any other provision in this article. The comprehensive sign plan shall be attached to the lease agreements or sale of space within the project and becomes binding for the entire site for both existing and future owners/tenants. In case of any conflict between the provisions of the plan and this article, the approved plan shall control.

(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-20. - Sign location.
A.
No sign shall be erected, relocated, or maintained so as to prevent free ingress or egress from any door, window, or fire escape.
B.
No sign or any part thereof, except authorized traffic signs, shall be located in any public right-of-way. No sign may be located in any sight visibility triangle (see section 12-1E).
C.

(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-21. - Measurement of sign area.
A.
Size generally. The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same thoroughfare-oriented wall are within 24 inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon.
B.
Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delimits the sign face.
C.
For changeable copy signs, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or coloring forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. Such changeable copy signs cannot flash, and if located within 150 feet of a thoroughfare right-of-way, may not change more than once per 24 hours.
D.
Multi-faced signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-22. - Measurement of sign height.
A.
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
1.
Existing grade prior to construction; or
2.
The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
B.
Where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public thoroughfare or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public thoroughfare, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the thoroughfare before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required).
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-23. - Construction standards.
A.
Building and safety codes. All signs permitted under this article shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the applicable building and safety codes. The city may remove after due notice any sign which shows neglect or becomes dilapidated.
B.
Faces. The face of a sign shall be flat, with protrusions of no more than two inches to allow for the texture of the sign and words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements. No sign or other advertising structure shall be constructed so as to have nails, tacks, or wires protruding therefrom.
C.
Illumination. Signs, when illumination is permitted and except as otherwise restricted in this article, may only be illuminated externally. Freestanding signs with external illumination shall have light directed downward. Externally illuminated signs shall not exceed 55 footcandles. All sign lighting shall comply with the night sky requirements of section 5-19.
D.
Landscaping, weeds, and grass shall be kept cut in front of, behind, underneath, and around the base of freestanding signs.
E.
Construction. Freestanding sign structure/base materials shall match the principal structures material. Any architectural color standards of the district shall apply only to the sign structure not to the sign face.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 8-24. - Location standards.
If not otherwise stated, any sign not specifically allowed for a particular use by this section shall be prohibited, except as otherwise provided for under this article. The following standards shall govern the sign quantity, size, and other standards based on the sign's location.
