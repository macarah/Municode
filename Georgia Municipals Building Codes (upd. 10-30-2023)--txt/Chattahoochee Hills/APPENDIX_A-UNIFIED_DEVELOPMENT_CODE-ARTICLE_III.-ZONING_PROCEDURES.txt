Said appeals shall be filed with the zoning administrator in writing on forms provided by the zoning administrator within 15 days following the date of such order, requirement, decision, or determination.
2.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the city council, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the city council or the county superior court, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
3.
The city council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and provide 15 days' notice thereof as well as written notice to the parties in interest. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent or by an attorney. The mayor shall request that the appeal be identified and read. The aggrieved party shall then be allowed a total of ten minutes for presentation of data, evidence and opinion concerning the appeal. If all ten minutes are not used, the aggrieved party's remaining time may be reserved for rebuttal. The acting party and those in opposition to the appeal shall then be allowed a total of ten minutes for presentation of data, evidence and opinion concerning the order, requirement, decision, or determination. The presentation times may not be reduced but may be extended by majority vote of the city council , provided they are expanded equally for the aggrieved party and the acting party.
4.
Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the city council shall decide on each appeal. The city council shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but in no event more than 45 days from the date of the filing of the appeal unless an extension of time is agreed to by the appealing party. The city council may reverse, defer, sustain, or modify any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator or other authorized city official and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken. An appeal shall be sustained, or the decision below modified, only upon an expressed finding by the city council that the authorized city official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that said official's action was arbitrary. The action of the city council on an administrative appeal shall be final.
B.
Appeals from final decisions of the city council.
