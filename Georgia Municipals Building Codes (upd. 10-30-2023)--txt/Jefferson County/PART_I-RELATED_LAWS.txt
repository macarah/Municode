Editor's note— Printed herein is 1984 Ga. Laws, page 3627, which provided for a board of commissioners of the county. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Section 1. - Establishment; powers.
There shall be a board of commissioners of Jefferson County which shall be the governing authority of Jefferson County and which shall have, in addition to such other powers as may be granted by other laws, the powers of a judge of the probate court when sitting for county purposes as provided by O.C.G.A. § 36-5-1.
Editor's note— 1987 Ga. Laws, page 1482, repealed provisions codified as O.C.G.A. §§ 36-5-1 through 36-5-8.
Section 2. - Composition.
The board of commissioners shall consist of a chairman and four other members.
Section 3. - Eligibility for office; commissioner districts.
(a)
No person shall be a member of the board if that person is ineligible for such office pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1 or any other general law.
(b)
In order to be elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district, a person must be a resident of that district prior to election thereto. Each member shall be elected by the electors voting within the respective commissioner district and not at large and must receive the number of votes cast for that office as required by general law. Only electors who are residents of that commissioner district may vote for a member of the board for that district. At the time of qualifying for election as a member of the board from a commissioner district, each candidate for such office shall specify the commissioner district for which that person is a candidate. A person elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district must continue to reside in that district during that person's term of office or that office shall thereupon become vacant.
(c)
The member of the board who is chairperson of the board may reside anywhere within Jefferson County and must receive the number of votes cast for such office as required by general law in the entire county. The chairperson must continue to reside within Jefferson County during that person's term of office or that office shall thereupon become vacant.
(d)
Those members of the board of commissioners of Jefferson County who are serving as such immediately prior to the effective date of this Act and any person selected to fill a vacancy in any such office shall continue to serve as such members until the regular expiration of their respective terms of office and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. On and after the effective date of this Act, the board of commissioners of Jefferson County shall consist of five members all of whom shall be elected from commissioner districts described in subsection (e) of this section except for the member who is chairperson and who is elected at large as provided in this Act.
(e)
For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, other than the chairperson, Jefferson County is divided into four commissioner districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district. The four commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those four numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act [inserted at the end of this section] and further identified as Plan Name: jeffwkl Plan Type: Local User: Tara Administrator: Jefferson.
(f)
When used in such attachment, the terms 'Tract' and 'BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Jefferson County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Jefferson County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.
(g)
Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they exist immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act.
