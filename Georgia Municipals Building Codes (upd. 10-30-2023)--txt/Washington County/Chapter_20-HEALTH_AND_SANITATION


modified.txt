(Ord. No. WC-62, § 1-16, 4-8-2004)
Sec. 20-21. - Policy.
(a)
This article shall be known as the "county biomedical waste ordinance."
(b)
The county board of commissioners declares it to be the policy of the county in furtherance of its responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and well-being of its citizens and to protect and enhance the quality of its environment, to revise and update existing laws, and to institute and maintain a comprehensive countywide program for all biomedical waste handling and disposal facilities which will ensure that the operation of such facilities does not adversely affect the health, safety, and well-being of the public and does not degrade the quality of the environment by reason of location, design, method of operation or other means.
(Ord. No. WC-62, § 1-1, 4-8-2004)
Sec. 20-22. - Findings.
The incineration of biomedical waste is increasingly proposed as a partial alternative to land disposal, however incineration of biomedical waste poses certain hazards to the environment and creates special problems of residue disposal in landfills. Also, other facilities that handle and dispose of biomedical waste pose certain unique hazards and are of special public concern. Under article 9, section 2, paragraph 3 of the Georgia Constitution and under the provisions of the Georgia Solid Waste Management Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-8-39) local governments are empowered with the responsibility to regulate biomedical waste incinerator facilities and biomedical waste disposal facilities in such manner as to ensure the public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. No. WC-62, § 1-3, 4-8-2004)
Sec. 20-23. - Purpose.
(a)
The purposes of this article are to regulate:
(1)
The location, construction, operation, management and closure of biomedical waste incinerator facilities, including autoclaves, dealing with the storage, transfer, treatment or disposal of biomedical waste; and
(2)
All other storage, transfer, treatment or disposal of biomedical wastes, including autoclaves, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the county.
(b)
The board of commissioners acknowledges that other industries in the county, particularly the minerals industries, use equipment to thermally (and otherwise) remove moisture and other natural impurities, for heat recovery and for other purposes. The board does not intend for this article, or any interpretation of this article, to in any way affect, regulate or restrict any such operations, equipment or practices provided that they do not involve the processing of biomedical wastes (as such term is defined in section 20-19).
(c)
Furthermore, this article is limited strictly to matters directly involving biomedical waste. This article shall not regulate in any manner any other industry located now or in the future in the county. Many industries and business entities use chemicals, heat, animals, animal parts, and raw materials in their processes. No industry shall in any way be regulated, affected or restricted by this article other than those specifically involving biomedical wastes in their normal processes as described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(Ord. No. WC-62, § 1-4, 4-8-2004)

The term "construction" means the active commencement of building a biomedical waste incinerator, autoclave or biomedical waste disposal facility.
(2)
The term "construction" does not include preliminary activities such as locating property, purchasing property, preparing plans, clearing, grading or fencing property.
Expanding its operation means any action taken by such person after the effective date of this article to increase its present state permitted volume of waste incineration, disposal or handling at the facility.
(b)

Any violation of the conditions of the permit issued by the EPD/DNR and/or the USEPA, and any violation of the rules and regulations of the EPD/DNR, USEPA, the state department of transportation, the United States Department of Transportation, and rules and regulations promulgated under the Occupation Safety and Health Act shall also be a violation of the conditions of the county permit issued pursuant to this article.
(c)
No person shall engage in the construction or operation of a biomedical waste incinerator facility, autoclave or a biomedical waste disposal facility without first having a permit authorizing such activity issued by the board of commissioners pursuant to this article.
(d)
Any person who began construction or operation of a biomedical waste incinerator facility, autoclave or a biomedical waste disposal facility prior to enactment of this article shall be permitted to continue the construction or operation of such facility but the person shall be strictly prohibited from transferring ownership or operation of or expanding its operation in any way, unless the person first makes application to the board in accordance with this article and complies with the applicable provisions hereof.
(Ord. No. WC-62, § 1-5, 4-8-2004)
Sec. 20-25. - Notification/permit modification requirements.

The purpose of this meeting shall be for public review of the application. The staff shall give notice by regular mail of the time and place of the public meeting to the owner and adjacent property owners as specified on the map. Such notice shall be mailed not less than 14 days prior to the date specified thereon. Notice of a public meeting in a form prescribed by the board shall be posted by the applicant on the proposed facility property on each and every street of access not less than 14 days prior to the date specified thereon. The posted notice shall be at intervals of not greater than 1,500 feet. Notice shall also be placed by the applicant in the county newspaper not less than 14 days prior to the dates specified thereon.
(f)
Within 45 days after the public hearing, the staff shall make a recommendation to the board of commissioners at a public meeting whether to accept the application, deny it, or accept it with modifications. This recommendation shall be made to the full board; however, before making a recommendation to the board to accept the proposal or accept it with modifications, the county staff shall make the following determinations:
(1)
There is a bona fide need for the facility and there is no reasonable alternative facility which will pose a lesser threat to the health, safety and well-being of the public and the environment.
(2)
The construction and operation of the facility will not pose an unreasonable health or environmental risk to the surrounding locality.
(3)
The applicant (or facility operator) has the capability and financial resources to construct, operate and maintain the facility in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances.
(4)
The applicant or operator has taken or consented in writing to take any and all reasonable measures to comply with the applicable federal, state and local regulations and ordinances.

(6)
The proposed facility is compatible with an integrated county long range solid waste management plan, taking into account alternative methods of management such as recycling.
(7)
The applicant has a valid contract with the operator of a state licensed landfill for the disposal of any projected ash production of the incineration facility for a three-year period.
(g)
At its next scheduled meeting, the board shall make its decision to grant the permit, deny it, or grant it with specified conditions.
(h)
A permit shall be valid for 36 months from the date it is granted by the board.
