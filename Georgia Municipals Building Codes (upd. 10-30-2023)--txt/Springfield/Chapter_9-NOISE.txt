Sec. 9-2. - Sound level limitations.
(a)
No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any sound source in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound level limits set forth in Table 1 of this section when measured at or within the real property line of the receiving property using the slow response setting of the sound level meter unless otherwise noted. Such a sound source would constitute a noise disturbance.
