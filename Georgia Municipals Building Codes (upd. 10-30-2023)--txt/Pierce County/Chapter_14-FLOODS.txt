ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 14-1—14-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 14-19. - Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the state has, in Ga. Const. art. IX, § I, ¶ I, and art. IX, § II, ¶ III, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Code 2005, § 26-31; Ord. of 10-7-1997, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 14-20. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Code 2005, § 26-32; Ord. of 10-7-1997, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 14-21. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Code 2005, § 26-33; Ord. of 10-7-1997, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 14-22. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Sec. 14-23. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common loadbearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter loadbearing walls is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the county code inspector's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Coastal high hazard area means the area subject to high velocity waters caused by, but not limited to, hurricane wave wash. The area is designated on a firm as Zone VI-30, VE or V.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
Elevated building means a non-basement built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (post and piers), shear walls or breakaway walls.
Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the first floodplain management code, ordinance, or standard based upon specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special flood hazard.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the:
(1)
Overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
(2)
Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term "floor" does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles.
Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term "functionally dependent facility" does not include long-term storage manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building.
Mangrove stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which is mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above the ground and which contain one or more of the following species: Black mangrove (Avicennia nitida); buttonood (Conocarpus erecta); red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle); or white mangrove (Longuncular-iaracemosa).
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures, placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. The term "mean sea level" is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced after the effective date of the first floodplain management code, ordinance, or standard based upon specific technical base flood elevation data which establishes the area of special flood hazard.
Sand dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start of construction" means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. The term "permanent construction" does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building. The market value of the building should be:
(1)
The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

Sec. 14-79. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 14-25 or section 14-51(11), the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 14-51(9).
(3)
Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of the openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
b.
Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(4)
Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard, established in section 14-25, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and have erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments, unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base discharge;
b.
If subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division;
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring standards of section 14-78(2), and the elevation standards of subsection (1) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (4)a of this section are met.

Sec. 14-80. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-25, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 14-51(11).
(Code 2005, § 26-93; Ord. of 10-7-1997, art. 5, § C)
Sec. 14-81. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
(a)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(d)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
(Code 2005, § 26-94; Ord. of 10-7-1997, art. 5, § D)
Sec. 14-82. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-25, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential buildings shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
