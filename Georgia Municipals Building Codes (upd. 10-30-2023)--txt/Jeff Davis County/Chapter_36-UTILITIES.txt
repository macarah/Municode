Sec. 36-103. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Hazardous waste means any solid waste that has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.
Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use.
Perennial river/stream means a river/stream or section of a river/stream that normally flows continuously throughout the whole year.
Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the river bank; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area.
River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. The term "subdivision" includes all divisions or re-subdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads. Excluded from this definition is the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased.
Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. The term "wetlands" generally includes swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Ord. of 10-11-2001, § 3)
Sec. 36-104. - Permit procedure; maps.
(a)
Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the county shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the county board of commissioners. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the county.
(b)
Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the county shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the state department of human resources according to the "Rules of State Department of Human Resources Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" manual for on-site sewage management; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 in section 36-112, if on-site sewage management is utilized or this division, whichever is stricter.
(c)
On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the county until site approval and an on-site sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the county health department.
(d)
Permit coordination. The required permit shall not be issued until the county health department issues an on-site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this division, including the "Rules of State Department of Human Resources for On-Site Sewage Management Systems." If the county health department is delegated the responsibility for administering this division, the permit or letter under this section shall suffice as the permit.
(e)
Requirements are minimums. The regulations and requirements set by this division shall be the minimum requirements.
(f)
Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the county shall also meet the requirements of all other department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, state's uniform construction codes, and state department of natural resources and state environmental protection division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this division does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply.
(g)
Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this division because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the county board of commissioners, or the county health department, if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this division, shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in this section.
(h)
Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the county board of commissioners or the county health department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at their own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to state department of natural resources' environmental protection division, and the county board of commissioners or the county health department if the county health department is delegated responsibility for administering this division. Any costs for submission of evidence to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration.
(i)
Coordination with zoning and other regulation. This division shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the county board of commissioners, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this division shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirements to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district.
(j)
Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this division shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates. The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the county board of commissioners from time to time.
(Ord. of 10-11-2001, § 4)
Sec. 36-105. - Delegation of administration.
The county board of commissioners, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the county health department and the county administrator with responsibility for administering this division and ensuring compliance with its provisions.
(Ord. of 10-11-2001, § 5)
Sec. 36-106. - Wetlands protection regulations.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.
(b)
Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the county and to be regulated areas under this division will be the federal fish and wildlife service's national wetlands inventory maps for the county. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency.
(c)
Wetlands development permit requirements.
(1)
No activity or use except those specifically permitted under this section shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit under this division. Activities or uses permitted under section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission or determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this division have been satisfied.
(2)
If there is a determination in the administration of this division that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular division section is necessary.
(3)
If there is a determination in the administration of this division that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this division
(4)
If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this division will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission or determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required.
(5)
No action in the administration of this division, or no local permit issued pursuant to this division relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance.
(d)
Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the county to the extent they are not prohibited by any other division or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.)
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require a section 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(4)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(5)
Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(e)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state "Rules For Environmental Planning Criteria" receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants and hazardous or sanitary waste landfills are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
(Ord. of 10-11-2001, § 6)
Sec. 36-107. - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the county to be regulated areas under this division is the state department of natural resource manual "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)."
(c)
Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All uses except those prohibited by this section and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(1)
All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of federal environmental protection agency rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
All single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the state department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DHR Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 as set forth in section 36-112. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A—F) of the DHR Manual. The minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply.
(3)
All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located.
(4)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the county health department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this division.
(5)
All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins.
(6)
All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five by 10 -7 centimeters per second or other criteria established by the federal natural resources conservation service.
(d)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them:
(1)
All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities.
(2)
New facilities handling 10,000 pounds or more of hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, Public Law 94-580, codified generally at 42 USC 6901 et seq., excluding underground storage tanks, on any one day.
(3)
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins.
(Ord. of 10-11-2001, § 7)
Sec. 36-108. - Major river corridor protection district regulations.
(a)
Findings of fact. Perennial river or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(b)
District delineation. Protected rivers as defined under the rules for environmental planning criteria, adopted by state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 includes any perennial river or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Ocmulgee River through the county meet these criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along the entire length of these rivers within the jurisdiction of the county. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank within the county jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the rules for environmental planning criteria, no development or other land-disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses.
(c)
Permitted uses. No development, or construction, or other land-disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses:
(1)
Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area.
(2)
Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection divisions, provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the county health department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection divisions.
(3)
Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection divisions, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations.
(4)
Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., or any local requirements, if stricter.
(5)
Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state forestry commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq.
(6)
Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the state department of agriculture and the state environmental protection division; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
(7)
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8.
(8)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(9)
Wastewater treatment.
(10)
Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation.
(d)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
(1)
Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes.
(2)
Hazardous or solid waste landfills.
(3)
Septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer area under any circumstance.
(4)
Septic tanks within the 100-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with this section.
