ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 42-1—42-28. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION

Sec. 42-29. - Authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners, of Columbia County, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-30. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Columbia County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-31. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion.
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-32. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health.
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains.
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas.
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer, and intended to be improved property.
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or continuous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. This term is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals, or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Start of construction is the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, alteration or improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the local code enforcement official, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a historic structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article.
(11)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 42-35, require the applicant to obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer section 42-44.
(12)
Maintain all records pertaining to the provisions of this article, and such records shall be open for public inspection.
The foregoing responsibilities may be performed or otherwise carried out by county employees or other appropriate designees of the administrator, as determined by the county administrator.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-44. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
(a)
General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
(2)
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top and/or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
(3)
New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(4)
New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
(5)
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
(6)
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(7)
New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters;
(8)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and
(9)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which structure is not in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall not further or extend the non-conformity, and shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article.
(b)
Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where basic flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 42-35 or subsection 42-43(9), the following standards are required:
(1)
Residential construction. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Furthermore, access to the nonresidential structure shall be constructed at an elevation equal to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that design and methods of construction are in accordance with the accepted standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 42-42.
(3)
Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a.
Designs for complying with the requirement of this subsection (3) must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
b.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other utility connections shall be elevated a minimum of three feet above the base flood elevation.
c.
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises or entry to the elevated area.
d.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(4)
[Standards where data is available.] Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than three foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than three foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement per subsection (2).
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (1), above.
(5)
Floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which can carry debris, potential projectiles and have erosion potential. The area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. The following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge.
b.
If the provisions of this subsection are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
(c)
Building standards for residential single-lot developments on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. For a residential single-lot development not part of a subdivision, located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35 where streams exist but where no base flood data have been provided, or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
The administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of the ordinance. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to two times the width of the stream at the top of the bank, or 25 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. In A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed the lowest floor must be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (b)(2).
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
(4)
The administrator shall review and record the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(d)
Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (b)(2).
The administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 42-43.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-45. - Standards for subdivision.
(a)
Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
(b)
The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. If floodway data is not available, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA.
(c)
General standards. All subdivision and/or development proposals shall:
(1)
Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(2)
Have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters and discharges from the systems in to floodwaters.
(3)
Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(4)
Provide access elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation to residential developments.
(5)
Provide access elevated to or above the base flood elevation to commercial developments.
(6)
Have greater than 50 percent of each residential lot outside the limits of the special flood hazard area. In the R-A and R-1 zoning districts, the director or his/her designee may reduce the percentage of a residential lot that may be outside of the special flood hazard area, provided that the lot is of sufficient size and topography that the buildable area that remains outside the special flood hazard area is determined by the director or his/her designee to be adequate for the construction of the improvements proposed without subjecting them to unnecessary flooding risks.
(7)
Provide the minimum lowest floor elevation for each residential lot encroached upon by the special flood hazard area.
(8)
Provide base flood elevation data for all subdivision and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, as determined from the FIS or a FEMA approved flood study. For subdivisions and other proposed development, including but not limited to manufactured home parks, containing land where no base flood data has been provided (A-Zone), which are either greater than 50 lots or greater than five acres, base flood elevations shall be developed using detailed methodologies for submittal to FEMA as a letter of map revision (LOMR). Prior to approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant shall submit a copy of the LOMR to the administrator for review and approval using the community consent forms. The applicant shall be responsible for forwarding the LOMR submittal package to FEMA. The LOMR must be approved by FEMA prior to the county's acceptance of the final plat. Any development activity conducted by the applicant prior to final LOMR approval by FEMA will be performed at the risk of the applicant.
(9)
Any physical changes to the base floodplain shall be submitted and approved by FEMA as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, prior to approval of the preliminary plat. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the administrator using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval from FEMA shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Prior to recording of the final plat, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of subsection 42-44(c) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the administrator prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any floodway or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and,
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the administrator until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the administrator.
(f)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The administrator may direct the property owner (at no cost to Columbia County) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the administrator.

Sec. 42-46. - Standard for critical facilities.
(a)
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
(b)
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 )
Sec. 42-47. - Variance procedure/appeals.
(a)
The county board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Columbia County Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that proposed repair or, rehabilitation will not result in the structure losing its historical designation and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such applications, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the penalties and/or enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief.
(1)
Stop work order. The administrator may issue a stop work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures necessary to cure the violation or violations, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations.
(2)
Withhold certificate of occupancy. The chief building official may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures necessary to cure the violations.
(3)
Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The administrator may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures necessary to cure the violations, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the administrator may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations.
(4)
Civil penalties. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this article, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a violation of this article. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction by the magistrate court, be fined not more than $1,000.00 per offense. Each action or inaction of non-compliance or violation shall be deemed a separate offense, and each day any such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this article.
