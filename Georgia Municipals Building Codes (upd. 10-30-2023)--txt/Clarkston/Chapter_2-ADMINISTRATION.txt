DIVISION 1. - ETHICS RULES

Sec. 2-40. - Preamble.
All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. (Ga. Const. art. I, § II, ¶ I). The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are:
(1)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(2)
The constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and the ordinances of the City of Clarkston should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct.
(3)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(4)
Elected officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.

All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.

Using public office for private gain.
(2)
Impeding city efficiency or economy.

Anything, regardless of its monetary value, which, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence the mayor or a member of the city council in the performance or non-performance of an official action.

(c)
Failure of the hearing officer to take either action above within sixty (60) days of receipt of the complaint shall constitute dismissal of the complaint and no other evidence of dismissal shall be needed. In the event of dismissal of the complaint by the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall set forth the reason for dismissal in a written order to be recorded in the file related to the complaint and maintained by the city clerk. If the hearing officer refers the complaint to the city council for consideration, the hearing officer shall provide the city council with written findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendation for punishment.
( Ord. No. 380, § 1(attch.), 10-7-14 )
Sec. 2-63. - City council action.
If the hearing officer determines that a preponderance of the evidence supports a finding of a violation of the code of ethics, the city council shall take action on the complaint at the next regular meeting of the council after the hearing officer refers the matter to the council for action. If a majority of a quorum of the city council finds by clear and convincing evidence that a violation of the code of ethics has in fact occurred, it is authorized to punish the offender according to the punishments set forth in section 2-71. After the city council finds an offender guilty of the violation charged, a majority of a quorum of the city council must agree to the punishment.

The review by the superior court shall be limited to an inquiry of whether there was any evidence before the city council which supported the decision of the city council.

( Ord. No. 380, § 1(attch.), 10-7-14 )
