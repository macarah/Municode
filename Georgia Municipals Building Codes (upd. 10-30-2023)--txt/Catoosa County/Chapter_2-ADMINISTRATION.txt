Sec. 2-129. - County to provide liability insurance and to pay the deductible for individuals appointed to serve on various boards of the county government and volunteers.
The board of commissioners of the county from time to time appoints members to serve as directors and members of various boards of authorities, commissions, and committees. These appointees provide substantial and valuable services to the citizens of the county and enhance the effectiveness of local government. The county also maintains a network of volunteers who provide invaluable services to the citizens of the county with no pay saving the taxpayers of the county thousands of dollars. Service on these boards, authorities, and committees by the members, as well as volunteers, is compensated by nominal pay and in many incidences no pay. The board of commissioners desires to provide liability insurance coverage so that the individuals who provide these valuable services for the citizens of the county will have insurance available if they are sued for acts or omission performed in or failed to be performed in the course and scope of their official duties or for acts or omissions performed or failed to be performed in the scope and course of their work for the county. The board also desires to establish, as policy, that the deductible on the liability insurance policies will be paid from county funds.
(1)
Application: This resolution shall apply to the individuals who are directors or members of boards or commissions appointed by the governing authority of the county, the individual members of the committees appointed by the governing authority of the county and individual volunteers who perform labor or services normally provided by local government or who provide labor or services for projects undertaken by the county.
(2)
Insurance coverage: The county shall provide liability insurance coverage to the individuals identified in subsection (1) under the existing policies of liability insurance providing liability insurance coverage for the board of commissioners, public officials, officers, and employees. The insurance to be provided by this resolution shall be the same insurance policies that now cover public officials, officers, and employees of the county.
(3)
Payment of deductible: The county shall pay any deductible required to be paid under the coverage afforded under the insurance policies described in subsection (2) hereof.
(4)
Scope: It is not the intent of this resolution to provide insurance above and beyond the insurance currently available to county officials, officers, and employees. If the carrier of the liability insurance for the county declines coverage because the act or event giving rise to the claim is not a covered event under the policy, the county shall be under no obligation to provide liability insurance or to pay any deductible under any policy other than the county policies. These cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis by further resolution of the board of commissioners.
