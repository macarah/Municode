ARTICLE XIV. - PLANNED AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT (PAD)
These regulations shall officially be known, cite[d], and be referred to as the Planned Agricultural District of McIntosh County, Georgia (hereafter "PAD"). The Planned Agricultural District (PAD) is intended to provide a residential development option that supports sustainable development goals, protects open space and agricultural lands, and retains the predominantly rural character. It is not the intended to create a zone for future expansion of urban services through this ordinance.

Section 1. - Intent.
The regulations set forth in this Ordinance are intended to serve the following purposes.
A.
To preserve the rural character through the permanent preservation of agricultural lands;
B.
To allow development that permanently preserves agricultural lands, and a portion of associated agriculture protection buffers such as woodlands, floodplains, wetlands, critical views and other natural features of rural community;
C.
To allow for limited development in rural areas;
D.
To allow limited development in areas outside the Urban Growth Boundary where urban services will not be extended;
E.
To allow flexibility in the placement and type of dwelling units within the subdivision;
F.
To promote the use of shared septic, drinking water and stormwater systems that prevent the degradation of water quality;
G.
To reduce the amount of impervious surfaces in subdivisions, including roads, sidewalks and driveways.
Section 2. - Size and Composition.
An individual Planned Agricultural District shall be composed of two distinct areas: the Legacy Area and the Community Area. The total Planned Agricultural District shall be contiguous in location and configuration provided that roads, utility easements or other similar features may divide the site. The Planned Agricultural District shall be configured in such a manner as to permit continuation of any farming use on the Legacy Area.
2.1.
Design Requirements.
A.
Minimum Area of Development: The minimum size of subdivision in the Planned Agricultural District is forty (40) acres.
B.
The maximum allowed gross density is one (1) unit per ten (3) acres.
2.2.
Legacy Area.
A.
Definition: The Legacy Area in the Planned Agricultural District is open space that is generally comprised of large connected areas that have agricultural characteristics and uses on the property. The Legacy Area shall not be part of any individual residential lots or other part of the Community Area. It shall be substantially free of structures, but may contain historic structures and archaeological sites including Indian mounds, and/or such recreational facilities for residents as indicated on the approved development plan. Agricultural and farming activities may and are encouraged to continue within the Legacy Area.
B.
The following criteria must be met in order to designate a Legacy Area:
1.
The proposed area shall demonstrate consistency with agricultural land preservation. The preservation of agricultural land shall guide the location and use of the designated Legacy Area.
2.
The Legacy Area shall be designated as permanent preservation lands through a conservation easement that is held in perpetuity as defined by Georgia Statutes. Agricultural and similar rural uses shall be identified in the easement recorded in the Official Records of McIntosh County. The purpose of the easement is preservation of land for its availability for agricultural use.
3.
No more than thirty percent (30%) of the Legacy Area shall be non-agricultural land such as important buffers to agricultural lands composed of forested uplands, wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, unique habitat, and other natural buffers.
C.
One or more of the following criteria must be met in order to be eligible for becoming a PAD. The defining agricultural characteristic must be included in the Legacy Area:
1.
Lands include prime agriculture soils as mapped by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), regardless of current usage.
2.
Lands support existing or historically active agriculture, including cropland, tree farms, and pasture.
3.
Lands are currently designated by an agricultural land use or zoning code regardless of actual use or characteristics.
2.3.
Community Area.
A.
Definition: The Community Area is comprised of all land in a proposed Planned Agricultural District that is not defined as part of the Legacy Area. Development within the Community Area shall be clustered and transition away from the boundary of the Legacy Area to ensure functional agricultural and similar rural uses and compatibility with adjacent property. The allowable gross density in Planned Agricultural Districts and the relative size of the Legacy Area and Community Area shall adhere to the following standards:
B.
Density in Community Area. If 67% or more of the gross area of the parcel is designated as a Legacy Area, then the residential density in the Community area shall be one residential unit per acre.
C.
Density Bonus: The gross density may be increased if the Planned Agricultural District complies with one or more of the following four (4) standards. Each standard provides a density bonus of 5% in addition to the gross density (maximum bonus permitted is 10%).
1.
Creating an endowment where the principal would generate sufficient annual interest to cover the conservation easement holder's yearly costs (taxes, insurance, maintenance, enforcement, etc.).
2.
Providing for shared or community drain fields for septic systems.
3.
Providing affordable housing, to include a minimum of 25% of all units that would be affordable to moderate-income households, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
4.
Reusing historical buildings and structures, including those sites inventoried by the Georgia Department of Archives and History. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties shall apply.
D.
Commercial Area. Planned Agricultural Districts containing greater than one hundred (100) residential dwelling units may also include neighborhood-scale commercial uses within the Community Area.
1.
Maximum Area: The maximum size of a commercial parcel is three (3) acres.
2.
Floor Area Ratio: The Floor Area Ratio is the total building square footage (building area) divided by the site size square footage (site area). The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of allowable neighborhood-scale uses is 0.175.
3.
Commercial area shall comply with the standards of the C-N District.
4.
If neighborhood-scale commercial uses are to be included, the Community Area's permissible density shall be calculated by reducing the total Community Area by the acres constituting the neighborhood-scale commercial uses. The remaining acres are then multiplied by the appropriate density standard.
2.4.
Buffers. Within Development Areas, a native vegetation buffer consistent with the McIntosh County Water Resources Protection Ordinance shall be maintained around all open water areas, unless a specific common beach or grassed area is identified. Also, a perimeter buffer at least 50 feet wide shall be maintained along all sides of the Community Area. This 50-foot perimeter buffer may consist of wetland and upland and may be included within either the Community Area or the Legacy Area. Uses within the perimeter buffer shall be limited to those associated with passive recreation. The perimeter buffer areas shall be left in their natural state or appropriately planted with native grasses and/or shrubs and trees. At the discretion of the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator, roads may be substituted for a portion of the perimeter buffer (up to 25 feet) if the road creates an effective barrier separating yards from agricultural uses.
Section 3. - Site Design.
3.1.
Lot Design.
A.
Individual lots need not meet a minimum lot size and shall be clustered to provide for a compact and contiguous Community Area design. Lots and building sites shall be designed to achieve the following objectives listed in order of priority:
If development contains individual or communal septic systems, lot sizes and configuration of drain fields must be approved by the McIntosh County Health Department and these systems must be located on the most suitable soils for sub-surface septic disposal.
B.
Lots and building sites should be located on the least fertile soils for agricultural uses, and in a manner which maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use.
C.
Building sites should be located to minimize the impact of blocks of forest land and to maximize the continuity of agricultural lands.
D.
Building sites should be located in areas least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas as viewed from roads.
3.2.
Utilities.
A.
Individual Septic Systems: Individual well and septic systems are allowed in Planned Agricultural Districts, and these systems must be approved by the McIntosh County Health Department.
B.
