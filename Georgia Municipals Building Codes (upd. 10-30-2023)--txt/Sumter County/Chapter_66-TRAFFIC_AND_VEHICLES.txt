Sec. 66-107. - Administration of use of automated traffic enforcement safety devices
new
(a)
The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device provided for under O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18 shall maintain a log for the automated traffic enforcement safety device attesting to the performance of such device's self-test at least once every 30 days and the results of such self-test pertaining to the accuracy of the automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such log shall be admissible in any civil enforcement proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18. The law enforcement agency, or agent on behalf of the law enforcement agency, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device shall perform an independent calibration test on the automated traffic enforcement safety device at least once every 12 months. The results of such calibration test shall be admissible in any court proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18.
(b)
Prior to the placement of a device within a school zone, each school within whose school zone such automated traffic enforcement safety device is to be placed shall first apply for and secure a permit from the department of transportation for the use of such automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such permit shall be awarded based upon need. The department of transportation shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of this paragraph.

Such signs shall be placed within 500 feet prior to the warning sign announcing the reduction of the speed limit for the school speed zone. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such signs are properly installed pursuant to this subsection at the time of any alleged violation under this article; and
(2)
That no citation shall be issued for the first 30 days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by a law enforcement agency within a school zone, but rather, a civil warning shall be issued for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
(d)
A law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of a school zone, or an agent working on behalf of a law enforcement agency or governing body, shall send by first class mail addressed to the owner of the motor vehicle within 30 days after obtaining the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle but no later than 60 days after the date of the alleged violation:
(1)
A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the violation, the location of the infraction, the maximum speed at which such motor vehicle was traveling in photographically recorded images, the maximum speed applicable within such school zone, the civil warning or the amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed, and the date by which a civil monetary penalty shall be paid;
(2)
An image taken from the photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction;
(3)
A website address where photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction and a duplicate of the information provided for in this paragraph may be viewed;

A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency authorized to enforce the speed limit of the school zone and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law;
(5)
A statement of the inference provided by Georgia law and of the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted for such violations;

(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images. A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
