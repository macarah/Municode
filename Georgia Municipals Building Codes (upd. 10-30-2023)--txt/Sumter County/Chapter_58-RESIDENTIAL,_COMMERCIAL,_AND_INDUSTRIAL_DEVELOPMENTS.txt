Sec. 58-175. - Dedications.
When features of other plans adopted by the board of commissioners (such as schools or other public building sites, parks, or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part in a land subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
(Ord. of 9-19-06)

(Ord. of 9-19-06)
Sec. 58-177. - Large-scale developments.
The requirements of this chapter may be modified in the case of a large-scale community or PUD such as a housing project or shopping center, which may or may not be subdivided into customary lots, blocks and streets, if the development meets the requirements of the ordinances of the county, is approved by the board of commissioners, and if it is in conformity with the purpose and intent of this chapter.

Sec. 58-178. - Lots on existing dirt road.
(a)
When a developer subdivides lots on an existing dirt road, and the existing right-of-way for the dirt road is less than the minimum right-of-way for county paved roads, the developer shall reserve sufficient right-of-way, as measured from the centerline of the future paved road, as set by the county engineer, for the future widening and improvement of the road.

The existing dirt road mentioned in this section means an existing public dirt road that the public has a right to use, and which road is a part of the network of the public transportation system of the county, and does not include an existing dirt road that may be located in an unapproved subdivision. The conveyance of the additional right-of-way to the county is the conveyance of a future interest and not a present interest and such conveyance does not mean the county accepts the road, nor does it exempt the road from the requirement that, if and when the road is paved, it shall be paved to county standards.

(5)
The county does not and will not accept title or responsibility for any dam or lake and will not accept title or responsibility for any street that traverses a dam, and the county does not and will not accept any responsibility for the maintenance of the dam or any street that traverses the dam.
