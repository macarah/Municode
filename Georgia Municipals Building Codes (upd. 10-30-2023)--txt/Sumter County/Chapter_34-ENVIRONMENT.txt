Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-34(b)(2) of this article;
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. of 10-19-2010(1))
Sec. 34-35. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Sumter County Board of Commissioners without first obtaining a permit from the Sumter County Code Enforcement Office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Sumter County Code Enforcement Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 34-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 34-71. - Purposes.
The Sumter County Board of Commissioners hereby declare that it is important for the unincorporated areas of Sumter County to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of said community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, drug free and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, Sumter County needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, prevent illicit drug use and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.

The Sumter County Board of Commissioners shall appoint or designate the director of code enforcement, county fire marshal, county fire chief, sheriff, county administrator, director of public works and his/her designees as public officer(s) to exercise the powers prescribed by this article.

Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of Sumter County charging that any dwelling, building, or structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the county where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing.
(d)
If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the compliant or appeared at the hearing an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used be in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, of qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
(e)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the county are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(g)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(1)
The lien provided for in subsection (g) above shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of the Sumter County Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Sumter County and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
(2)
Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties.

It shall be the duty of the tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, chapter 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall collect and enforce liens imposed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9 in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of Sumter County whose lien is being collected.
(3)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9 may be initiated at any time following receipt by the tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties or unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter.
(4)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9 shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9 together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority and tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(5)
The county may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(6)

No person, firm, association or corporation shall erect, install, place, or maintain boards over the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure or otherwise secure such openings by a means other than the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure without first applying for and, within 30 days of application, completing all steps necessary for the issuance of a boarding permit and thereafter having a valid and current boarding permit therefore from the building official. Any properties with boards existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived will have one year from the date of the ordinance's adoption to make application to continue to board.
(b)
Code enforcement shall issue a boarding permit required by subsection (a) upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or his/her authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by the director of code enforcement or his/her designee that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. Code enforcement is authorized to establish a fee schedule so as to enable the county to offset its reasonable expenses in reviewing the application and monitoring the boarding process.
(c)
The boarding permit issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the boarding or other securing of a building or structure for an initial period of six months. If the structure is still boarded at the end of each such six months, the boarding permit may be renewed upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor with the submission of the application occurring no later than ten business days prior to the expiration of the original permit, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by a county code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. The issuance of a renewal-boarding permit shall also be subject to all of the following conditions:
(1)
The owner shall submit a detailed plan for correction, repair or rehabilitation of violations of state or local building and housing standards and for the securing of the doors, windows and other openings by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure or, alternatively, a detailed plan for sale of the property to another person or entity with provision in the sale of correction, repair or rehabilitation; and

(d)
A boarding permit may not be extended beyond the renewal period nor may a new application for the same property be accepted by code enforcement within one year of the date of expiration of the prior permit, except upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee, upon the confirmation through inspection by a county code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this chapter and upon demonstration that "good cause" for the renewal exists. "Good cause" shall require a showing by the owner that the permit renewal is made necessary by conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as inability to obtain financing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in construction or rehabilitation, or unanticipated damage to the property. In addition, where appropriate, "good cause" shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed repair, rehabilitation or correction or is attempting to sell the property. In the event that the director of code enforcement determines that there exists good cause to renew the permit and that all other conditions are met, the permit may be renewed by the owner for an additional one year, subject to all of the same conditions imposed on the original renewal permit.

ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION ORDINANCE[5]

Footnotes:
--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(1), §§ 1—9, 11, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. V, §§ 34-126—34-135 was at the editor's discretion. The appendix is not included herein but is available for public inspection in county offices.

Sec. 34-126. - Title of the article, findings and objectives.
(a)
Title of article. This article shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia.
(b)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in Sumter County and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources Sumter County and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.
(c)
Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), §§ 1—1.3)
Sec. 34-127. - Establishment of groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands in unincorporated Sumter County, Georgia, outside the Cities of Americus, Andersonville, DeSoto, Leslie and Plains, that are mapped and designated as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition.
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), § 2)
Sec. 34-128. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the groundwater pollution susceptibility map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), § 3)
Sec. 34-129. - Permit requirements and enforcement.
No building permit, rezoning request or subdivision plan will be approved by the permitting officer unless the permit, request and/or plan is in compliance with the groundwater protection standards listed herein.
(1)
Enforcement. The permitting officer, his agent, officers and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their assigned duties and responsibilities under this article, and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the permitting officer deems necessary.
a.
The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution.
b.
The permitting officer shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
c.
Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to assist the permitting officer in enforcement.
d.
The permitting officer shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein.
e.
When the permitting officer determines that a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove the structure.
f.
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation, or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable.
(2)
Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in section 34-129(3), applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area district shall include a site plan providing the following information:
a.
A map or maps, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet (1″=50′) showing all planned improvements including the width, depth and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, water courses and drainage ways, water lines, wastewater and storm water facilities, and utility installations.

[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

ARTICLE VI. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION ORDINANCE[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(2), §§ 1—11, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. VI, §§ 34-151—34-161 was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 34-151. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The State of Georgia has determined river corridors are of vital importance to the quality of life in the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions, including pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of flood water, erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty.
The state's Comprehensive Planning Act of 1989 provided for coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments, including consideration for the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within their jurisdictions. The O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorized the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state, and requires local governments to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing local comprehensive plans. The method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishment of a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river.
(b)
This article shall be known as the River Corridor Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to provide for protection of the river corridor along the Flint River and Kinchafoonee Creek by regulating activities in or adjacent to the corridor; provide for the powers and duties of Sumter County; provide goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provide minimum standards for regulated activities within the river corridor; provide for a review of decision; provide for hearings and judicial review; provide for enforcement; prohibit certain activities or actions; provide for civil and other penalties; repeal conflicting ordinances; and other purposes.

For purposes of this article, the terms listed below shall be defined as follows:
Board means Sumter County Board of Commissioners.
Buffer orbuffer area: See "river corridor".
Comprehensive plan means The Comprehensive Plan for Sumter County, and as may be amended. (NOTE—The plan needs to be amended for purposes of this article).
Contaminant means any "regulated substance," as defined by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as in effect on the date of passage of this article [December 19, 2000] and as amended from time to time, and all petroleum products, including gasoline, oil, waste oils, and other fuels as well as their hazardous constituents.
County means Sumter County, Georgia.
Hazardous material means any "contaminant" as defined in this article, and any hazardous chemical for which a material safety data sheet must be filed in 42 USC 11021 and 11022.

Land-disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, or the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Person means any individual, group of individuals, association, firm, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, organization, or legal entity of any kind, including municipal corporations, government agencies, or subdivisions thereof.
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. By this definition, the Flint River and Kinchafonnee Creek in Sumter County are protected rivers.
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and including all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.

ARTICLE VII. - WETLAND PROTECTION ORDINANCE[7]

Footnotes:
--- (7) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 1—8, 10, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. VII, §§ 34-176—34-184 was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 34-176. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, Georgia.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 1—1.2)
Sec. 34-177. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, Georgia, outside the cities of Americus, Andersonville, DeSoto, Leslie and Plains. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the code enforcement officer.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 2—2.2)
Sec. 34-178. - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b), below shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within a wetland protection district boundary, or within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local permitting officer of a copy of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall; however, be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. Disturbances of wetlands for agricultural purposes are subject to the Swampbuster Act of the 1985 Farm Bill, and are to be reported to the USDA Farm Service Agency prior to commencement.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(c)
Temporary emergency permit. A temporary, emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons:
(1)
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
(2)
Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
(3)
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4).
(4)
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(d)
Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn to a scale of one inch equals fifty feet (1″ = 50′), unless a different scale is approved, in advance, by the permitting officer, with the following information:
(1)
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved with cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.
(2)
A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.
(3)
Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet.
(4)
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the subject site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
(5)
Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent.

(7)
All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(e)
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article.
(f)
Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision approval will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(g)
Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
(1)
Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The permitting officer may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot.
(2)
Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a way around wetland areas. When considering subdivision approval, the permitting officer may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
(h)
Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the permitting officer. Filing fees up to the larger of $25.00, or $100.00 per acre shall be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the permitting officer.
(i)
Enforcement authority. The permitting officer is the department, office or individual assigned the responsibility of administering this article. At the time this article is adopted, the administrative authority is vested in the office of the code enforcement officer.
(j)
Review procedures. The application shall be made to the permitting officer and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon the permitting officer's written determination that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, conditional approval or disapproval) by the permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the permitting officer. If the review process is not completed and written finding not released within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved.
(k)
Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the permitting officer may be appealed to the Sumter County Board of Commissioners. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the county clerk within ten days of the decision rendered by the permitting officer. A public hearing shall be held by the board of commissioners for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the Sumter County Board of Commissioners shall be issued within 15 days of the public hearing and may be appealed to the Sumter County Superior Court.
