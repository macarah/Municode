ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 2-1. - Requirement for acceptance of deeds and plats.
Since the board of commissioners does not have to accept title to property conveyed to such board, and since it can be confusing to the public to have a deed recorded, or a plat recorded, that the board of commissioners has not accepted, and may not accept, any person desiring to convey title in property to the board of commissioners of the county is required to submit the written conveyance and/or plat to the board of commissioners for the commissioners' acceptance, approval or rejections. Deeds that are accepted shall have stamped on their face:
"Accepted by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County this _____ day of ________, 19___."
and signed by the county administrator of the county or by the chairman of the board of commissioners. No deed or plat will be recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court without such a stamp appearing on the face of the deed.

Fiscal year and emergent needs. The fiscal year for Sumter County begins July 1 and ends June 30.

Claim includes all claims presented against an employee prior to institution of a proceeding.
Employee means the members of the governing body of the county, employees of the county, elected or appointed county officers and their appointees and employees, including appointed members of county commissions, past, present, and future.

(b)
Exclusions. There is excluded further from the operation of this section any claim or proceeding as to which insurance is provided by the county.
(c)
Construction. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to constitute any waiver, by the county or by any employee, of the governmental immunity afforded it under the constitution and laws of the state. The county and its employees specifically reserve the right to assert their immunity prior to the entry of judgment in any claim or proceeding, and subsection (f) shall not be applicable to require the county or any employee to pay any sums based on claims from which the county and its employees are immune. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted in any way to reduce or eliminate the rights of any employee of the county against any other party.
(d)
Defense of employees. Whenever any claim is made or proceeding is brought against any employee, either against him asserting personal liability for damages arising out of the performances of his duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based on negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether federal, state or local, the county shall, upon his written request, provide for his defense unless otherwise limited by the terms of this section. The board of commissioners of the county may decline defense of an employee or decline payment of a claim against an employee if the employee has failed to give notice in writing of any claim or proceeding to the board within 30 days after the employee has notice of a claim or if the employee has failed to give such notice within five days after service of a proceeding.
(e)
Grounds for refusal of defense.
(1)
The county shall refuse to provide the defense of a claim or proceeding brought against an employee if it determines that:
a.
The act or omission did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.
b.
The employee acted or failed to act because of actual or intentional misconduct, fraud, corruption, malice or in bad faith.
c.
The proceeding is a criminal prosecution.
d.
Provisions of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in the best interest of the county.
e.
The employee acts or fails to act as a result of, or at a time when, the employee's own self-indulgence substantially impaired the employee's judgment (as, for example, an officer or employee who causes damage or injury while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs while on the job).
f.
The employee acts or fails to act, except in emergencies or the existence of extenuating circumstances, directly contrary to advice of the county attorney or safety personnel.
g.
The employee acts or fails to act in such manner as to constitute a criminal act (as, for example, misappropriation of property or funds).
h.
The employee fails to cooperate in the defense of the claim or proceeding.
i.
The employee acted or failed to act in willful disregard of county policy or specific instructions of the employee's supervisor.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the county from providing a defense against a claim or proceeding where there is a conflict of interest between one employee or group of employees of the county as compared with another employee or group of employees.
(3)
The determinations required by subsection (1) of this subsection (e) shall be made by the board of commissioners of the county. The commissioners will make this decision upon the advice of the county administrator, the county attorney, and department heads, and upon any internal investigation of the claim or proceeding. The commissioners may refuse at any time, prior to, or after approval of assumption of the defense, to provide for the defense of an employee if it is determined that any of the grounds for refusal set forth in this section exists.
(4)
Upon approval of the defense of a claim or proceeding against an employee, the board of commissioners of the county shall refer the matter to the county attorney for disposition. In the event two or more employees or groups of employees are involved, and the interest of one employee or group of employees conflict with the interest of another employee or group of employees, then and in such event, the board of commissioners of the county shall specify which employee or group of employees shall be represented by the county attorney and shall authorize other employees or groups of employees to employ counsel at the expense of the county; provided, however that the selection and compensation of such other counsel shall be subject to the prior approval by the board of commissioners of the county.
(f)
Payment of judgments, settlement of claims.
(1)
Where defense of a claim or proceeding against an employee is provided by this section, all final judgments awarded in courts of competent jurisdiction against the employee in proceedings to which this section applied or any amount payable under any settlement of such proceeding or of claims in accordance with this section shall be paid by the county as hereinafter provided. All compromises of claims or proceedings governed by this section shall be submitted to the board of commissioners of the county for its prior approval.
(2)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of judgments and claims shall be limited as follows:
a.
No sum will be paid where the employee's liability is based on a discretionary act, and the county and the employee reserve the right to assert all governmental and sovereign immunity in defense of such claims. Payment of judgments and claims pursuant to this section shall be made only where liability is based upon a ministerial act of the employee. It is the intent of this section to provide for the payment of claims or judgments only where the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity may not be asserted initially as a defense to the claim or proceeding.
b.
No sum will be paid in any one claim or proceeding on behalf of any employee in excess of $50.00 in the case of any claim or claims brought by one claimant, and $200.00 for any number of claims of numerous claimants arising out of the same occurrence.
c.
No sum will be paid under the provisions of this section for punitive or exemplary damages.
d.
No sum shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant unconditionally releases the employee and the county from any and all claims, causes of action or judgment arising out of the subject claim or proceeding.
e.
There is excluded further from the operation of this section any claim or proceeding as to which insurance is provided by the county. There is further excluded from the operation of this division any claim or proceeding as to which the county has, by resolution or otherwise, provided for the payment and defense of claims or proceedings arising from the ownership, use or maintenance of county motor vehicles.

(2)
Second, the board of trustees at its next regular meeting shall either select one of the three persons named in such list as a member of the authority to fill the vacancy or decline to select any of the persons named on the list.

Whenever an appointment to fill a vacancy on the board of trustees of the authority is made, either for an unexpired term or a full term, consideration shall be given by the applicable nominating participating unit in nominating proposed members and by the board of trustees in selecting members as to whether a licensed doctor of medicine or registered nurse currently serves on the authority.
