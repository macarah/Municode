(Ord. of 10-18-05)
Sec. 70-41. - Approval process.
(a)
Uses subject to administrative approval. Subject to certification by the planning director of compliance with the general requirements, development requirements and standards enumerated above, the following uses may be administratively approved within 30 days of receiving application, supporting engineering certification and lease approval, if any, without the necessity of public hearing.
(1)
Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the county provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible and a license, permit or lease authorizing such tower is thereafter approved by the county.
(2)
Installing an antenna on an existing structure, so long as said installation is considered to be a stealth technology installation that does not significantly change the profile of the existing structure and so that the installation is not readily noticeable to the untrained eye. Such installations including cables leading to the antennas shall be painted to match the paint and colors on the existing structure and shall not protrude from the existing structure in a noticeable fashion.
(3)
Co-location by installing an antenna on any existing tower or alternative tower structure.
(4)
Replacing an existing tower with a new tower designed to accommodate two or more users so long as such new tower does not exceed the height limitations of subsection 70-40(f) and setback requirements of this article are met. After the replacement tower is built only one tower shall remain on such site. Support equipment shall, where technically feasible, be located underground.
(5)
Locating any alternative tower structures (man-made trees, clock towers, bell steeples, or light poles that, based on staff determination, effectively camouflage or conceal towers and antennas) provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or otherwise incorporated into the alternative structure.
(6)
Installing any antenna or tower not to exceed the limitations contained in subsection 70-40(f) and provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or shielded to the satisfaction of the planning director or his/her designee.
If the planning director or his/her designee determine that any application for an administratively approved use does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, administrative approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Such evidence shall be summarized for the applicant along with a recommendation as to whether the applicant should pursue a variance or proceed to a public hearing as specified in subsection (b) below. Applicants may appeal the administrative denial to the county board of commissioners pursuant to the procedures described in Section _______ of Appendix A ("Zoning") of Sumter County Ordinances. Any other party aggrieved by the decision of the planning director or his/her designee may file an appeal to the board of commissioners including payment of the filing fee. For purposes of this section an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated.
The board of commissioners shall dispense with the appeal by either:
(7)
A determination that the application is valid and meets all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article, which shall result in the issuance of a permit.
(8)
A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an approved administratively use under this article, but, owing to special conditions, a variance as to separation or setback requirements:
a.
Will not be contrary to the public interest;
b.
Will relieve unnecessary hardship; and
c.
Shall preserve the intent and spirit of this article.
(9)
A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article and the deficiencies cannot, subject to the conditions listed above, properly be cured by a variance.
Applications which do not satisfy all applicable criteria must, as a result, apply for a public hearing before the board of commissioners as specified in subsection (b) below.
(b)
Other uses—Public hearing required.
(1)
If the proposed tower or antenna is not included under the above described administratively approved uses, or the application does not on its face satisfy the development standards and other criteria specified herein, then a public hearing before the board of commissioners shall be required for the approval of the construction of a wireless transmission facility in all zoning districts. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the planning and zoning department and pay the required fee at such time. Applications, when complete, shall be placed on the next available agenda of the board of commissioners. At least 30 days prior to any scheduled hearing, the planning and zoning department shall cause a sign to be posted on the property and the publication of a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation. Said notice shall state the nature of the application, street location of the proposal and height of the proposed structure.
(2)
Before approving an application for an "other use," the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. The factors considered in granting such a permit include those enumerated in sections 70-39 and 70-40. The board of commissioners may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in their discretion doing so will advance the goals of this article as stated in section 70-36.

If, upon inspection, the county concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice to the applicant, said applicant shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the applicant fails to bring the tower into compliance within the 15 days, the county may remove the tower at the applicant's expense. Prior to removal of any tower, the county may consider detailed plans submitted by the applicant for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17.
(c)
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17.
(d)
All maintenance or construction on wireless transmission facilities shall be performed by persons employed by or under contract to the owner between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday except in cases of emergency.

(Ord. of 4-19-16(2))
Sec. 70-80. - Application to solar farms.
This article shall apply to all solar farms or photovoltaic solar energy production facilities located in the unincorporated areas of the county, which shall hereafter collectively be referred to as "solar farms."
(Ord. of 4-19-16(2))
Sec. 70-81. - Standards for solar farms.
All solar farms in the unincorporated areas of the county shall comply with the following standards:
(a)
Reserved.
(b)
Solar farms shall be fenced in using a chain link fence with a height of at least six feet with anti-climb devices with three barbed wire line arms or otherwise acceptable to the county code enforcement department. brightly colored signs no smaller than one foot by two feet shall be posted on the fence every 100 feet warning of danger and high voltage.
(c)
Abutting residential properties shall be visually screened year round from any solar farms to the reasonable satisfaction of the county code enforcement department through any one or a combination of planting or existing vegetation or fencing, all of which shall be at least six feet in height.
(d)
Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the ground mounted solar photovoltaic installation and consistent with best practices for the preservation of natural areas or good husbandry of the land or forest.
(e)
The height of any vegetation within ten feet of any solar panels or equipment shall not exceed 18 inches and shall be no less than two inches in height over the soil surface. Any disturbed land shall be stabilized by a permanent seeding of perennial vegetation such as grass or other dense surface cover that will protect the soil surface from erosion, prevent sediment and runoff at the site from reaching downstream areas, and enhance the aesthetics of the site. It is recommended that a slow-growing, vegetative cover be utilized so that general maintenance of the growth can be kept to a minimum.
(f)
The names of the manufacturers, installers, facility owners, and facility operators, and their addresses and phone numbers shall be posted on the required fencing at each entrance of a solar farm.
(g)
All electrical interconnection and distribution lines within a solar farm's boundaries, except for power lines that leave the project or are within the substation, shall be underground, unless the county code enforcement department grants a written exception due to severe environmental constraints.
(h)
Lighting of a solar farm and its accessory structures shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation and shall be reasonably shielded from abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of a solar farm shall be directed downward and shall incorporate full cutoff fixtures to reduce light pollution.
(i)
All solar farms shall comply with any other applicable requirements of the county code of ordinances and Appendix A, Zoning, including, but not limited to, setback and height requirements.
(j)
All solar farms shall have a Knox box entry system at the primary entrance. The Knox box entry system shall comply with the specifications of the International Fire Code.
(k)
All solar farms shall have a written emergency response plan that shall be approved by the county's code enforcement department, sheriff's office, fire department, and emergency management agency. Each solar farm shall update its emergency response plan no later than January 1 of each year with a copy provided to all departments and agencies named in this subsection. The emergency response plan shall include the following:
(1)
The phone number, email address, and street address for all manufacturers, installers, owners, and operators; and
(2)
The phone number, email address, and mailing address for a representative of the solar farm responsible for responding to public inquiries; and
(3)
The material safety data sheets that apply to any materials on the solar farm; and
(4)

(l)
Any solar farm that has not been in use for a period of 180 consecutive days for its original purpose as approved by the county code enforcement department shall be deemed abandoned and shall not be authorized to recommence operations until a new application and inspection have been completed.
(m)
The owners and operators of a solar farm and the owners of any real property on which it is located shall be jointly responsible for the removal of the solar energy system, its equipment and panels, and any appurtenant structures and for restoration of the site to as natural a condition as reasonably possible, all of which must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the Sumter County Code Enforcement Department no later than 90 days after abandonment or closure. No later than 120 days after abandonment or closure, the owners or operators of any such solar farm shall provide written documentation acceptable to the Sumter County Code Enforcement Department demonstrating that the solar panels and related equipment were properly disposed of in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. In addition to all other available legal remedies, including calling the bond required per section 70-82(d), if the entire solar energy system has not been removed within 90 days after abandonment or closure, Sumter County may remove the solar energy system, its equipment, and panels and any appurtenant structures, and may place a lien for the costs of removal upon the real property on which the solar farm was located. Prior to removing the solar energy system, Sumter County shall provide ten days' written notice to the owners and operators of the solar farm listed in the emergency response plan required pursuant to subsection (k) of this section and the owners of the real property on which the solar farm is located. Said notice shall be provided by personal delivery or certified mail to the last address reasonably known and shall be posted on the property. Any delay by the county in taking action pursuant to this subsection shall not in any manner waive the county's right to take such action.
(n)
The county code enforcement department may, in its reasonable discretion, waive any of the above-listed conditions which are not reasonable in light of the nature of the project and may add additional conditions or safeguards as needed for public health, safety, and welfare or to mitigate the impact of the solar farm on surrounding properties and uses. Violations of any such additional conditions or safeguards shall be a violation of this article.
(o)
All of the conditions and requirements in this section shall be of a continuing nature.
