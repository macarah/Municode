ARTICLE III. - SPEED HUMP PROGRAM

Sec. 50-51. - Introduction and general standards.
(1)
Function of the Walton County Speed Hump Program and ordinance. In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the Walton County Public Works Department (the "department") has studied other similar communities and how those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. One popular and cost effective measure is the installation of speed humps. When properly designed and installed, and with strong community support, speed humps are effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimentation and testing, the use of speed humps has been formally endorsed by transportation authorities worldwide. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The following program and ordinance has been established for the citizens of Walton County who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods.
(2)
Street classification. Walton County will only consider installation of speed humps on streets classified as local, residential streets with a speed limit of 25 mph. Traffic engineering studies may indicate that speed humps would be unnecessary or unsafe at certain locations. Data obtained from traffic engineering studies of physical and traffic related factors should be used in determining where speed humps are appropriate. A preliminary field investigation performed by the department prior to the traffic study may find that speed humps are not warranted due to existing conditions such as but not limited to horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distance, length and width of roadway.
(3)
Legal authority. Speed humps shall be placed only by the authority of the board of commissioners in accordance with the authority vested in the board of commissioners by O.C.G.A. §§ 32-4-40 et seq., 36-1-20, 40-6-371.
(4)
Standardization of application. In keeping with the general recommendation of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), uniformity aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. 1 Strict adherence to the standards and guidelines outlined in this article will help ensure that any given speed hump installation will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorists regardless of where it is encountered.
(Res. of 12-5-2006, § 1)
Note— 1 MUTCD, current edition, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.
Sec. 50-52. - Program elements.
(1)
Initial request from community. The process for speed hump installation begins with letter from the community desiring speed humps requesting a traffic study by the department. Such letter (the "initial request") should come from a community representative, homeowners' association, or individual that certifies that the request is on behalf of at least a majority of the lot owners in the subject area (such initial request need not contain signatures of the majority of lot owners; rather the individual submitting the initial request must certify that the request is on behalf of a majority of lot owners). Following receipt of the initial request, the department will perform a preliminary field inspection. If the street, grade and other fixed factors do not meet the necessary requirements for speed humps, the initial request will fail and no further action will be taken. If the street, grade and other fixed factors qualify for the speed hump program, the department will notify the person or persons who submitted the initial request. Then the department shall conduct a traffic study to determine whether the subject street meets the hereinbelow established criteria.
(1.1)
Speed criteria. Traffic studies must find that a speeding problem exists, based on the standard of an 85th percentile speed of at least five mph over the posted speed limit of 25 mph. 2 The 85th percentile speed is an excellent indicator of street character.
(a)
Below speed criteria. Since research has determined that speed humps reduce 85th percentile speeds to approximately 28—30 mph, installing humps on streets with an 85th percentile below criteria speed does not meet generally accepted cost/benefit ratios, and is not recommended. Streets with 85th percentile speeds less than 30 mph will not be considered for the speed hump program.
(b)
Speed criteria. The Walton County Public Works Department recommends limiting the use of speed humps to residential streets where excessive speeding can be documented. Streets with 85th percentile speeds over 35 mph will require a 70 percent approval of the homeowners in the defined service area, via petition as described in subsection 50-52(4). Streets with 85th percentile speeds of 30—35 mph require a 90 percent approval of the homeowners in the defined service area, via petition as described in subsection 50-52(4).
(c)
Design speed over 25 mph. The application of a speed reduction device which lowers the 85th percentile speed more than 15 mph will tend to create a pronounced "sine wave-type" velocity profile. Such a velocity profile may be inappropriate in regards to traffic safety. Since research has determined that speed humps reduce 85th percentile speeds to approximately 28—30 mph, installing humps on streets with design speed of 45 mph or greater is not recommended.
(2)
Establishment of a special assessment district. If a street or street section meets or exceeds the speed criteria (set forth in subsection 50-52(1) above) and meets the street classification criteria (set forth in subsection 50-51(2) above), the department will create a special assessment district which will consist of those properties which directly abut the street on which the proposed speed humps will be located and that are located in the immediate vicinity of the proposed speed humps. Properties should be excluded from special assessment district if the department determines (in its experience and discretion) that such properties would receive no, or only a remote, benefit from the proposed speed humps. Properties should not be added to or deleted from special assessment districts in an attempt to alter voting ratios.
(3)
Speed hump proposal. Department personnel will create a speed hump proposal by planning the placement of speed humps on streets meeting program criteria using the following guidelines 3 :
(a)
Grade. Speed humps should not be installed on street sections with grades greater than eight percent.
(b)
Number of humps in a series. Speed humps are not to be used to slow traffic at a given "point," but rather to reinforce a safe speed along a street or street section. For this reason, a single hump is not recommended. Usually, a series of humps should not exceed three-quarters of a mile. If the street or section of street on which the proposed speed humps will be located exceeds one mile, speed humps can be used in conjunction with other traffic calming devices, such as traffic circles, thus reducing the number of speed humps necessary to achieve targeted speed reduction.
(c)
Spacing. Research indicates that spacing humps between 350 and 500 feet apart is most effective at lowering the 85th percentile speed to the targeted speed range.
(d)
Location. The first hump in a series should normally be placed in a position where it cannot be approached at high speed from either direction. To achieve this objective, the first hump in a series is typically installed within 100 and 200 feet of a small-radius curve or stop sign. Care should be taken so that humps are not placed in a location that impedes or impairs access to any utility, manhole cover, and/or driveway cuts.
(4)
Petition for speed humps. Upon request, the department will forward the speed hump proposal, along with petition forms, to the homeowners' representative. Property owners, who are interested in pursuing the installation of speed humps, shall submit to the department a petition cover letter and a petition form. The following rules and requirements, which will be included with the petition forms, help ensure the fairness and integrity of the petition process:
(a)
The objective of the Walton County Speed Hump Program is to provide a process pursuant to which speed humps are installed on county maintained neighborhood roads, where engineering studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by a majority of the property owners in the area.
(b)
To have speed humps installed in Walton County, a petition must be submitted to the department. All of the property owners in the special assessment district should be contacted and given an opportunity to sign the petition, indicating their approval or disapproval concerning the installation of speed humps in the proposed location. Only the signature of the legal owner of the property will be proper for purposes of the petition. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. All property owners must sign individually, including the owners of undeveloped lots. The signature of tenants to the property shall not be acceptable. No signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the department. Each signature should also have the signature of a witness. The purpose of the witness' signature is to verify the signatures of the property owners, if in question. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the special assessment district. Each lot shall count as one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing the petition for that lot. Percentages of the homeowners as shown in subsection 50-52(1) must vote in favor.
(c)
The completed petition must be signed, by an authorized representative of the subdivision, notarized, and then returned to the department, where it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure that it meets all requirements. It will be returned to the sender if it does not meet the requirements. Petitions that do meet the requirements will be presented to the commissioners at a public meeting. In the case of a petition that fails to meet the requirements set forth herein, property owners must wait one year from the date of the initial request before requesting another study of that same street(s).
(5)
Public hearing before board of commissioners. A public hearing before the board of commissioners will be announced following submission of a petition meeting the requirements set forth in subsection (4) above. At the public hearing, the petition will be approved or disapproved by the board of commissioners in their sole discretion and contingent upon availability of funds for this purpose.
(6)
Miscellaneous program provisions.
(a)
The time span from receiving the petition to installation of the speed humps will be approximately four to six months. It is recognized, however, that factors beyond the county's control may delay the installation of the speed humps.
(b)
Speed hump program fee schedule is as follows: If preliminary field inspection and the traffic study warrant speed humps, and if approved by the board of commissioners, then the installation of the speed humps shall initially be funded and installed by the department. Thereafter, an annual fee for the installation, maintenance, repair and removal of the speed humps shall be $20.00 per year per each lot located in the special assessment district. Such assessment may be amended from time to time by the public works department, upon the written approval of the chairman of the board of commissioners and the chief of operations. In the event that the position of public works director is vacant, the amount of the assessment may be amended from time to time by the chief of operations, upon the written approval of the chairman of the board of commissioners.

The removal of speed humps may proceed or occur if the county is presented with a petition requesting that speed humps be removed.

Walton County reserves the authority to remove the speed humps at any time for reasons of safety, changes in: regulatory requirements, laws, guidelines and any new construction. All previously paid assessments are non-refundable upon removal of the speed humps.
