Sec. 2-81. - Findings.
(a)
Establishment. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on December 1, 1981, did create and establish the development authority of the county under the Development Authorities Law of Georgia, now codified as O.C.G.A. § 36-62-1 et seq., establishing its initial board of directors, their terms and manner of appointment.
(b)
Ex officio positions. The board of commissioners in an official meeting of such body on February 1, 1994, took action to create ex officio positions on the board of directors of the development authority of the county for the mayors of Monroe, Social Circle and Loganville, and the president of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce, and related matters.
(c)
Change of title. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on March 7, 1995, changing the ex officio position on the board of directors of the development authority of the county from the "president" to the "chairman" of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce due to a change in the corporate structure of the chamber.
(d)
Membership change. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on November 7, 1995, changed the membership of the board of directors of the development authority of the county from seven to nine members and thereafter appointed a member of the board of commissioners to fill one of the additional seats as an ex officio position, but due to an apparent typographical error in such resolution, it was necessary to adopt a corrective resolution on the same subject in an official meeting of the board of commissioners on January 7, 1997.
(e)
Current composition. The current composition of the board of directors of the development authority of the county serve by appointment of the county board of commissioners.
(f)
Logansville representative. The county board of commissioners in its meeting on July 10, 2001, was requested by the mayor and council of the City of Loganville to appoint a representative of their body, other than the mayor, and Councilman Wendell H. Geiger was suggested to represent that body on the development authority of the county, such appointment not being currently consistent with the existing resolutions related thereto.
(g)
Consolidation and clarification of previous resolutions. In order to create greater flexibility in the appointments to the board of directors of the development authority of the county and to more clearly define the terms of such directors, the board of commissioners has determined that it is desirable and appropriate to adopt a new resolution that consolidates and clarifies previous resolutions on this matter.
(Res. No. 2001-29, 8-7-2001)
Sec. 2-82. - Restatement, revision and modification of previous resolutions and actions.
Previous resolutions and actions of the county regarding the manner and terms of appointment to the board of directors of the development authority of the county are restated, revised and modified so that henceforth the composition of such board of directors shall be as follows:
(1)
The board of directors of the development authority of the county shall consist of nine members, all of whom shall be appointed by the board of commissioners of the county periodically for variable terms as hereafter provided. As mandated by O.C.G.A. § 36-62-5, the board of directors of the development authority shall be taxpayers residing in the county.
(2)
One representative each shall be appointed annually from the elected officials of the City of Monroe, City of Social Circle, and the City of Loganville for a one-year term as ex officio members of the county development authority, who shall be the mayors of such cities as representatives on the authority of their respective governmental bodies; and if for any reason a mayor shall be ineligible or declines to serve in such capacity, the board of commissioners may appoint a member of that city council for the one-year term as the representative on the authority board for such city. Such appointments shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year.
(3)
One representative shall be appointed annually from the board of directors of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce for a one-year term as an ex officio member of the Authority, who shall be the chairman of the board of directors of the chamber; and if for any reason the chairman shall be ineligible or declines to serve in such capacity, the board of commissioners may appoint another member of the board of directors for the one-year term as the representative of such organization on the county development authority. Such appointment shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year.
(4)
One representative shall be appointed annually from the board of commissioners for a one-year term as an ex officio member of the county development authority. Such appointment shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year.
(5)
The remaining four positions on the board of directors of the county development authority shall be appointed by the board of commissioners for terms beginning on December 1, 2001, initially for staggered terms of one, two, three and four years each, ending on November 30, 2002, November 30, 2003, November 30, 2004, and November 30, 2005, respectively. Thereafter, the appointments for each of these positions shall be for a term of four years each.
(6)
If, at the end of any term of office of any director, a successor thereto has not been elected, the director whose term of office has expired shall continue to hold office until his successor is so elected.

(Ord. of 12-1-15; Ord. of 7-11-23)
Sec. 2-135. - Ethical considerations.
modified
It is the policy of Walton County to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the county finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved generally through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the county.
Walton County declares that county employees and officials, along with those wishing to do business with the county, have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices.
Walton County employees, officials and their family members are generally prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift or promise of future benefit or any other thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition.
Walton County employees, officers and appointees shall not sell personal or real property to the county or any of its agencies, unless said sale amounts to less than $800.00 per calendar quarter (O.C.G.A 16-10-6) or unless such sale is made pursuant to sealed competitive bids made by the employee either individually or on behalf of a business entity. Furthermore, county employees should not perform services for the county in addition to their regular paid position unless it is done by contract and placed on the minutes of the board of commissioners.
It is unethical for any county employee or official to purchase commodities or services from a county contract for personal use.
Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other representative other than the purchasing department associate named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners. Any such communication shall be reviewed by the purchasing director and, if the purchasing director determines in his or her sole discretion that the communication at issue has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified.
Commodities or services shall not be purchased from a vendor who is delinquent or in default on the payment of any taxes or other monies due Walton County, or any other county, municipality, or state or the federal government. In the event it is discovered that a vendor is delinquent or in default on the payment of any taxes or other monies due Walton County, or any other county, municipality, or state or the federal government, the county may terminate any contract with such vendor and place the vendor on the ineligible source list as provided herein.

Part 3. - Procurement Methods

Sec. 2-151. - General procurement procedures.
modified
(a)
Purchases greater than $75,000.00.
(1)
Competitive sealed bidding. Except as otherwise provided herein, for purchases where either: (i) The costs of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is expected to be greater than $75,000.00, or (ii) Revenue is expected to be greater than $75,000.00, competitive sealed bidding is the preferred method of procurement and should be used whenever possible, as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions are required for competitive sealed bidding:
1.
Clear and adequate specifications are available; and
2.
Two or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process.
a.
Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be advertised as required by Georgia law to the extent applicable. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be advertised online and by the front door of the Walton County courthouse. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing manager.
b.
Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall not be considered by the county.
c.
Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid and such other information as the purchasing director deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection.
d.
Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below may be corrected if the purchasing director determines the correction to be in the county's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to price information or any required bonding shall be deemed material and may not be corrected after bid opening.
e.
Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, a bid may be withdrawn only in accordance with the following procedures:
• The bidder shall give notice in writing of his or her intent to withdraw his or her bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure.
• A bid may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of the original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn.
• The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if a request is made to withdraw the bid.
• If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
f.
Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date. Thereafter, any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the county.
g.
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the invitation to bid.
h.
Bid award. Subject to approval by the Walton County Board of Commissioners, bid(s) shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s), highest revenue responsive bid(s), or whose bid(s) represent the best value to the county.
The purchasing director may reject bids or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review, consistent with the best interest of the county.
The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: (i) a bid which is incomplete in any material aspect, element or fact; (ii) a bid submitted without required bonds; (iii) a bid submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list; and (iv) a bid submitted by a person in violation of the ethical requirements of this division.
In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local firm if only one of the bidders has its principal place of business in Walton County. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local firms, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by purchasing department staff in a public session where bidders will be invited to attend and one or more witnesses may be present.
Prices received through the bid process shall be in effect for sixty (60) days after the bid opening. If a second purchase is needed within six (6) months of the bid opening, it is not necessary to re-bid for the second purchase provided the bid price does not change.
(2)
Competitive sealed proposal method. When use of competitive sealed bidding is either impractical or not advantageous to the county for a purchase where either:
(i)
The costs of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is expected to be greater than $75,000.00; or
(ii)
Revenue is expected to be greater than $75,000.00, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal method. The following factors may be considered in determining whether to use the competitive sealed proposal method:
1.
Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services;
2.
Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the county's best interest;
3.
Whether fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous; and
4.
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
a.
Dissemination of request for proposal. Public notice of a request for proposal shall be advertised as required by Georgia law to the extent applicable. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be advertised online and by the front door of the Walton County courthouse. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing director.
b.
Receipt of proposal. No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the request for proposal. All proposals shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A proposal delivered late shall not be considered by the county.
c.
Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for proposal. Only the name of the person submitting the proposal shall be announced.
d.
Proposal cancellation. A request for proposal may be canceled prior to opening date. Thereafter, any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the county.
e.
Proprietary information. Information submitted with a proposal that is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the purchasing department without prior notification to the person submitting the proposal. Walton County is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted with a proposal. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary".
f.
Proposal evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposal. The evaluating team may communicate with anyone who submitted a proposal in order to clarify a proposal. No information concerning a proposal shall be communicated in any way to anyone other than the person who submitted the proposal. Additional information may be requested from anyone who submitted a proposal.
g.
Proposal award. Subject to approval by the Walton County Board of Commissioners, award shall be made to the responsive and responsible person whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the county based upon the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.
The purchasing director may reject proposals or may defer proposal awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review, consistent with the best interest of the county.
The following types of proposals shall be disqualified for consideration of award:
(i)
A proposal which is incomplete in any material aspect, element or fact;
(ii)
A proposal submitted without required bonds;
(iii)
A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list; and
(iv)
A proposal submitted by a person in violation of ethical requirements of this division.
(b)
Purchases of $75,000.00 or less. Purchases of $75,000.00 or less are considered informal purchases and do not justify the administrative time and expense of competitive sealed bidding or the competitive sealed proposal method; however, the processes used for this type of procurement shall include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the county. The purchasing director is authorized to establish the methods and procedures to be used in handling informal purchases. Unless otherwise specifically provided, such purchases shall be obtained competitively through telephone quotations or informal written solicitations. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bidding or the competitive sealed proposal method.
Each county department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director, to handle purchases of commodities and services where the cost does not exceed $2,500.00. These purchases may be made by use of a payment voucher. Such purchases may be reviewed for compliance by the purchasing director, and departmental authority may be revoked for misuse and violation of procedures.
Each county department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director, to obtain pricing for commodities and services where the cost is more than $2,500.00 but not more than $75,000.00. These purchases may be made by use of a purchaser order. For purchases of commodities totaling more than $2,500.00 but less than $15,000.00, the county department must obtain a minimum of three oral quotes, unless adequate source supply is not available, and the approval of the purchasing director. For purchases of commodities totaling $15,000.00 or more, the county department must obtain a minimum of three written quotes, unless adequate source supply is not available and the approval of the purchasing director or the county manager. All purchases of $25,000.00 or more must have final approval by the Walton County Board of Commissioners.
