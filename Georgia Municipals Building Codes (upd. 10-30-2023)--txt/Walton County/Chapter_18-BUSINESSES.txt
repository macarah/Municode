The renter's or lessee's location which is the site of personal property which is rented or leased from another does not constitute a location or office for the personal property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor. The site of real property which is rented or leased to another does not constitute a location or office for the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor unless the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor, in addition to showing the property to prospective lessees or tenants and performing maintenance or repair of the property, otherwise conducts the business of renting or leasing the real property at such site or otherwise conducts any other business, profession, or occupation at such site.
Occupation tax means a tax levied for revenue purposes on persons, partnerships, corporations, or other entities for engaging in an occupation, profession, or business.
Practitioners of professions and occupations shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business, if the business pays an occupation tax.
(Ord. of 7-1-14, § 1)
Sec. 18-32. - Purpose and scope of tax.
The occupation tax levied herein is not for regulatory purposes, but rather revenue purposes only. Occupation tax payment is not a condition precedent for transacting business or practicing a profession or occupation in the unincorporated part of the county.
(Ord. of 7-1-14, § 1)
Sec. 18-33. - Occupation tax levied; computation of full-time employees; occupation tax schedule; limitations.

Have one or more locations or offices within the unincorporated part of the county; or

Are out-of-state businesses or practitioners with no location or office in the unincorporated part of the county but:

b.
Own personal or real property which generates income and which is located in the unincorporated part of the county.

The occupation tax is levied based on the number of employees of the business or practitioner together with a flat fee. For occupation tax purposes, the number of employees of the business or practitioner shall be the sum of the number of full-time employees and the number of full-time position equivalents, with full-time employees being employees who works 40 hours or more weekly and full-time position equivalents being the sum of the average weekly hours of employees who work less than 40 hours divided by 40. With respect to businesses or practitioners with no location or office in Georgia, only those employees engaged in substantial efforts within Georgia shall be counted by the county for occupation tax purposes.

(d)
In the event a business or practitioner commences business on or after July 1 in any year, the occupation tax for that year shall be 50 percent of the tax due, except that a practitioner of a profession or occupation listed in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-9(c)(1)—(18) who elects as his or her occupation tax the amount described in section 18-34 shall receive no reduction in such amount.
(e)
A business or practitioner that is subject to occupation tax by more than one local government in Georgia shall only be subject to occupation tax by the county for the number of employees who are employed within the unincorporated part of the county. This limitation shall only apply when the business or practitioner has provided to the county satisfactory proof of current payment of the occupation tax of the other local government(s). Additionally, an employee who works for the same business or practitioner in more than one city or county shall be counted by the county for occupation tax purposes only if the employee works for the longest period of time within the calendar year in the unincorporated part of the county.
(f)
A business or practitioner with no location or office in Georgia shall only be required to pay occupation tax to the county if it is the local government in Georgia where the largest dollar volume of business is done or service is performed by such business or practitioner. This limitation shall only apply when the business or practitioner has provided to the county satisfactory proof of the applicability of this subsection. Additionally, if a business or practitioner with no location or office in Georgia provides to the county proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state that purports to tax the business's or practitioner's sales or services in this state, then the business or practitioner shall be exempt from this occupation tax.

ARTICLE VI. - PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINICS

Sec. 18-163. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority.
(a)
Based upon the experience of other municipalities, counties and states, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems potentially faced by Walton County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Illegal pain management clinics commonly known as "pill mills" dispense large quantities of Schedule II, III and IV drugs for cash, with little examination of the patient conducted. Moreover, it is the finding of the Walton County Board of Commissioners that the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics begets criminal behavior, tends to create an undesirable community, and constitutes a danger to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Walton County. Among the undesirable community conditions identified are drug addiction, drug overdoses, drug abuse, the illicit use of pharmaceutical drugs and other associated illegal activities. The Walton County Board of Commissioners finds that such conditions increase expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence hereof, and lead to a potentially dangerous condition for the citizens of Walton County. Therefore, this article is established to ensure that anyone dispensing or prescribing drugs within the unincorporated portions of Walton County is doing so in compliance with local, state and federal law. Preliminary information will be gathered from pain management clinics prior to the issuance of an occupation tax certificate. This article is created in the interest of public welfare and as a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the negative impact on Walton County as set forth herein.
(b)
This article is adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 13.
(c)
This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare of the citizens of Walton County.
(d)
This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of Walton County.
