EXPAND
Minimum Ideal Maximum Comments
(1) Disinfectant Levels
Free chlorine, ppm. In a pool, hot weather/heavy use may require operation at or near maximum levels. Regular superchlorination is recommended (see Remedial Practices below).
In a spa, during hours of operation, test the water hourly and record results. Maintain this range continually and shock treat at the end of the daily use period.
High combined chlorine results in reduced chemical efficacy. Take remedial action to establish break point chlorination (See Remedial Practices below). Other signs of combined chlorine:
- Sharp chlorine odor
- Eye irritation
- Algae growth
All public pools except as listed below: 1.5 1.5—3.0 5.0
1. Spas 3.0 3.0—5.0 10.0
2. Activity/interactive/wading pools 3.0 3.0—5.0 10.0
3. Continuous water course/rivers 2.0 2.0—5.0 5.0
4. Dual use pools 2.0 2.0—5.0 5.0
5. Falling entry pools 2.0 2.0—5.0 5.0

Spa 4.0—6.0 Spa 10.0
Iodine, ppm Levels not established — — Note: Local health department officials should be consulted before use.
(2) Chemical Values
PH 7.2 7.4-7.6 7.8 If pH is:
Too high:
- Low chlorine efficiency
- Scale formation
- Cloudy Water
Too low:
- Rapid dissipation of disinfectant
- Eye discomfort
- Plaster and concrete etching
- Corrosion of metals and vinyl liner damage
Total alkalinity (buffering), ppm as CaCo 3 60 80-100 for calcium hypo-chlorite and lithium hypo-chlorite and sodium hypo-chlorite
100-120 For sodium dichlor, trichlor, chlorine gas and bromine compounds 180 If total alkalinity is:
Too low:

Excessive high TDS may lead to hazy water, corrosion of fixtures, etc., and can be reduced by partial draining with addition of fresh water.
High initial TDS may indicate poor water quality due to corrosive mineral salts, humus or organic matter. Consult local water authority.
Increasing TDS indicates build up of impurities to be controlled by partial drain/refill with fresh water.
Calcium hardness, ppm, as CaCo 3 150 200—400 to balance water 500—1000+ Operations of pools, spas and hot tubs at maximum hardness will depend on alkalinity (buffering) requirements of the sanitizer used. Maximum alkalinity and lower pH must be used with maximum hardness (over 500 ppm)
Heavy metals, ppm None None copper 1.0
silver 0.1 If heavy metals, such as copper, iron, manganese, silver are present:
- Staining may occur
- Water may discolor
- Chlorine dissipates rapidly
- Filter may plug
- May indicate pH too low, corrosion, etc.
(3) Biological Values
Algae None None None If algae are observed:

(4) Stabilizer (if used)
Cyanuric acid, ppm 10 30-50 100 If stabilizer is:
Too high:
- May exceed local health department regulation
- May reduce chlorine efficacy
Too low
- Chlorine residual rapidly destroyed by sunlight
Note: Stabilizer is not needed in indoor or brominated pools and spas.
Superchlorination frequency Pool-monthly Pool-Every other week
Spa-Daily Pool-Weekly when the temperature is over 85°F Note: Some high use pools may need superchlorination three times a week or more as a preventative measure or when combined chlorine is over 0.2 ppm.
(5) Remedial Practices
Superchlorination to establish break point dosage in ppm. When combined chlorine is over 0.2 ppm, superchlorinate by adding ten times the combined chlorine ppm (eg. If combined chlorine is 0.3 ppm, superchlorinate by adding 3 ppm chlorine)
Applied at the end of daily usage, hold this level for 1—4 hours to clarify the water, remove ammonia (combined chlorine), and to kill any algae present.
Can also be applied when no bathers are present and as required to maintain clear water and the required halogen residual.
Shock treatment, dosage in ppm 10 — — Nonchlorine oxidizers are not considered biocidal, but may reduce organic contaminants.
Clarifying/floccing frequency — When needed — Use all clarifiers following manufacturer's directions.
Algicides Follow manufacturer's directions. Use E.P.A. registered products.
Water replacement Water in spas that have high bather use may require partial or complete replacement of water periodically to dilute dissolved solids, to maintain water clarity and to do necessary routine maintenance.

- Disinfectant level may be low
- Filtration system may be inoperative
- Improper chemical balance
- Bottom should be clearly visible at the deepest part of the pool or spa.
- Consult remedial practices
(8) Oxidizers
Ozone, low output generators — — 0.1 Serves as oxidizer of water contaminants
Contact concentration mg/L when ozone is injected and not removed prior to entry into pool. 0 0 0.05 Indoor installations should have adequate ventilation.
Above pool and spa levels
(9) Oxidizer Reduction Potential
ORP 650 MV — — When chlorine or bromine is used as the primary disinfectant, ORP can be used as a supplemental measurement of proper sanitizer activity. The use of ORP testing does not eliminate or supersede the need for testing the sanitizer level with standard test kits and ORP reading may be affected by a number of factors including (1) pH, (2) probe film and (3) cyanuric acid. Follow manufacturer's recommendations.
