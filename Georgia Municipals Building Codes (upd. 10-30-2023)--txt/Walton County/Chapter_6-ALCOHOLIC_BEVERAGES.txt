All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of Walton County. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent with the planning and development director or the director's designee and shall be in such form as he may prescribe.
(i)
The planning and development director, in his or her discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business.

(Ord. of 12-1-2009)
Sec. 6-43. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Preamble and purpose:
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas; Amarillo, Texas; St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; St Mary's, Georgia; Toledo, Ohio; Fort Worth, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; (as outlined also in the adult entertainment ordinance) which experiences the board of commissioners believes are relevant to the problems faced by the county and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and seminudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or seminude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or seminudity.
(b)
Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities:
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; or
(2)
Live entertainment, which provides or features nude or seminude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts, which simulate:
a.
Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law or:
b.
The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
c.
The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals; or
(3)
The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2) above which are obscene under state law; or
(4)
The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct.
(c)
Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) above, nothing in this chapter shall or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.
