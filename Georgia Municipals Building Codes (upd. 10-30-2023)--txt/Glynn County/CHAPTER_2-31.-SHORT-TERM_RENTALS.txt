If a Local Point of Contact fails to respond to calls or complaints regarding the condition, operation, or conduct of a Short-Term Rental, or the behavior or conduct of the occupants and/or guests thereof, in a timely and appropriate manner on three or more separate occasions within the immediately preceding 12 months, provided that the County provides the Certificate holder and property owner (if different) with notice of each such failure and a 14-day opportunity to respond to the notice in writing. It is not intended that an owner, Managing Agency, or Local Point of Contact act as a peace officer or place himself or herself in an at-risk situation.
(b)
If, upon investigation, the County Manager (or designee) determines that sufficient grounds exist to suspend or revoke a Certificate in accordance with this Section, the County Manager (or designee) shall issue written notice of the suspension or revocation to the Certificate holder and property owner, if different. Suspensions shall specify the length of the suspension, not exceed 12 months.

(d)
Should an Accommodation Excise Tax Certificate for any Short-Term Rental be revoked under this Ordinance, then no Accommodation Excise Tax Certificate shall issue for that Property or to that property owner or Certificate holder for that particular location for a period of 12 months after the effective date of the revocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a new Certificate may be applied for and issued under an application that otherwise meets the application requirements of this Ordinance: (1) if the subject property is sold to a new owner as part of an arm's length transaction; or (2) the application is submitted by a Managing Agency or Agent who will serve as the new Certificate holder, provided that it has not been the Managing Agency or Agent or Certificate holder for that particular property within the immediately preceding 12 months.
