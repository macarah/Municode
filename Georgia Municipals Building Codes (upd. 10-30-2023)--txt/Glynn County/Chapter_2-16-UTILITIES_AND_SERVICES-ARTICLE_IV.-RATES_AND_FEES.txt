ARTICLE IV. - RATES AND FEES

2-16-61 - User Charge System.
(a)
Charges for water service and for wastewater service shall be made and billed in compliance with the user charge system approved by the Utility with adjusted rates herein established; except, however, the Utility may suspend or forego the imposition and collection of connection/capital tap fees at any time when determine to be in the best interests of Utility. The user charge system shall be:
(1)
A base rate shall be charged based on the administration and debt costs and shall be calculated based on the number of water and wastewater customers and the assignment of REUs. Every customer connected to the Utility system will pay a base rate each month regardless of usage;
(2)
A consumption rate shall be charged based on the metered volume of water used by each water and each wastewater customer for the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs incurred by the Utility to be calculated on the basis of gallons of water measured; and
(3)
Water and wastewater tap fees consists of two components, connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees. Subject to the exception in paragraph (a), above, the customer at whose request for connection is made shall pay all fees and charges at the time an official request is made or at the time application is made for a building or plumbing permit, as applicable. All tap fees are payable to the Utility.
(A)
The connection/capital tap fee shall be calculated and charged on the basis of REUs. Any fractional units resulting from the calculation of REUs shall be treated as a whole unit.
(B)
The installation/operational tap fee shall be charged in accordance with schedules listed in the Utility's current rate resolution. Installation/operational tap fees shall apply only to installations on mains that are adjacent to the location to be served; for any extensions necessary beyond this condition the actual costs shall be charged in addition to connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees.
(b)
A user who discharges any toxic pollutants or other constituents which causes an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the aforementioned treatment works shall be required to pay for such increased costs. A surcharge will be applied to the overall strength of commercial or industrial wastewater based on the strength and volume of such wastes and the costs of treatment thereof.
(c)
The Utility shall review not less often than every two years water consumption and wastewater contribution of users, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the water and sewer systems, and the approved user charge system. The Utility may revise the charges for users to accomplish the following:
(1)
Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among users;
(2)
Generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service, administrative costs, and total operation and maintenance costs necessary for proper operation and maintenance (including minor replacement) of the water and sewer systems; and
(3)
Generate reserve fund contributions for emergency and/or capital planning requirements.
(d)
The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the Utility and users which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 204(b)(1)(a) of the Act and 40 C.F.R. Part 35.
(e)
The Utility may collect samples for the purpose of determining surcharge and compliance, and may charge the industrial user for this service.
(1)
The Utility may require industrial users to sample and test at their own expense for the purposes of determining surcharges and permit compliance.
(2)
In the event of a disagreement in results between samples collected by the industrial user and the Utility, the Utility results will prevail unless it can be proven that there was an error in Utility sampling or testing protocol.
(f)
Where a user has a private water source and discharges into the Utility sanitary sewer system, said user shall be required to install a proper water flow measuring device and pay the user charges for sewer service in an amount equal to the amount charged if all water used was purchased from the Utility, unless an accurate wastewater flow measuring device is installed, in which case the bill will be based on the wastewater meter.
(g)
Timing of Billing. Water and/or sewer charges shall accrue on a monthly basis from the date of connection and will be billed monthly thereafter.

(1)
When service has been cut-off for nonpayment or other action resulting in unauthorized use, service shall not be restored until the unpaid bill, either at the present location or at any previous location at which service was supplied to the applicant, and the service fees provided by the rate resolution are satisfied, including the following cumulative fees for each action taken to prevent unauthorized use of Utility services:

In the case of existing facilities with an increase in REUs, additional fees and charges will be due.
(d)
Deposits will be required, credited, or refunded as set forth in the Utility's Rate Resolution.
(e)
The Utility may refuse to supply service to any customer if there is a delinquent account for water and/or sewer service until the bill for all prior charges billed to that customer both at the present location or at a previous location have been paid by the customer owing the outstanding amount.
(f)

2-16-63 - Leak Adjustments in Water and Sewer Billing.
modified
The Utility recognizes that occasionally water service lines may develop hidden leaks, leading to unusually high water bills. The Utility encourages customers to make prompt and permanent repairs while showing consideration for unusual circumstances without burdening the Utility's other customers with the expenses of an individual customer's lost water. Accordingly, the Utility, under certain circumstances, provides customers the opportunity to request a leak adjustment in their water and/or sewer bill.
(a)
For purposes of this Section the following definitions shall apply:
(1)
"Physical damage" means damage to a facility or equipment supplying water to the premises and the damage:
(A)
Is not visible or detectable in the customer's premises except upon excavation or some other disturbance of the property; and
(B)
Is not the result of an act of the customer, or of any agent or contractor hired by the customer.
(2)
"Unusually high water bill" means a water and/or sewer bill for a particular month that reflects monthly water usage, in whatever units measured, that is at least two times the customer's average monthly usage of the premises as measured during the previous 12 monthly billing periods.
(b)
The customer retains control over the use of water on the customer's premises, and as such, the customer is responsible for all the water passing through the meter, including water which may be lost or wasted through leaking pipes or fixtures on the premises. The customer is responsible for monitoring for unusually high water usage as reflected on the customer's bill. The customer must promptly investigate any unusually high water bills. A customer is required to repair any water leak promptly, and the customer is responsible for all repair costs.
(c)
A customer may seek an adjustment under this ordinance to an unusually high water bill caused by physical damage to the customer's water service line.
(d)
A customer is not eligible for a leak adjustment to an unusually high water bill due to circumstances not caused by an undetected leak, leaks that should reasonably have been discovered, high usage caused by negligence or failure to properly maintain pools or water using/consuming items or usage from appliances whether or not operating properly.
(e)
A customer seeking a water bill adjustment must provide written notice to the Director, or his designee, within 90 days of the completion of the repair. The written notice/request shall contain the following information:
(1)
The name, address, and telephone number of the customer reporting the leak;
(2)
A description of how the leak was discovered;
(3)
The date the leak was discovered;
(4)
The nature and location of the leak;
(5)
The date the leak was repaired; and
(6)
A description of the repair work completed.
The customer shall provide any other information, documents, or access requested by the Director as may be necessary or appropriate for investigating the circumstances of any alleged leak and/or related repairs and verifying the customer's eligibility for an adjustment.
(f)
The adjustment period for undetected leaks cannot exceed one regular meter reading period, unless (i) the meter reading was missed during the leak period, or (ii) the leak affected two consecutive bills.
(g)
If the Director, or his designee, determines, upon investigation, that a customer is eligible for a leak adjustment, then the Director, or his designee, is authorized to adjust the unusually high water bill as follows:
(1)
The customer shall be responsible for half of the increase above the customer's average monthly consumption for both water and service charges, as calculated by averaging the prior 12 months bills before the leak, or any portion of the prior 12 months if the customer has fewer than 12 previous bills.
(2)
The customer may pay the adjusted water and/or sewer bill in equal payments over a 12 month billing period in addition to the regular applicable monthly billing.
(3)
No late fees will be applied to the balance during the repayment period.
(4)
No adjustments will be made to the portions of the bill representing the fixed charges such as, for example, debt service.
(5)
Customers who have irrigated new sod on their property, have repaired irrigation system leaks or have filled a pool may request removal of all sewer charges above the customer's average monthly consumption once per calendar year as calculated by averaging the prior 12 months bills or any portion of the prior 12 months if the customer has fewer than 12 previous bills. Up to two consecutive billings periods may be adjusted. No water service charges will be adjusted in these cases and no adjustments will be made for regular irrigation usage, including cases of misprogramming of the automated irrigation systems controls.
(h)
The Director's, or his designee's, determination of eligibility for a leak adjustment is a final disposition of the matter; provided, however, any leak adjustment totaling $5,000.00 or more shall be presented by the Director to the Commission for final determination.
(i)
Customers that qualify for the Customer Assistance Program and have an increased balance due to a previously unapproved leak adjustment may seek reassessment of their leak adjustment application up to one year from the date of the repair.
(#O-2014-06; Ord. No. O-2020-01 , §§ V—IX, 3/5/2020; Ord. No. O-2023-04 , 5/4/2023)
2-16-64 - Discontinuance of Service.
(a)
Voluntary Discontinuance. A customer may discontinue service by providing the Utility with written notice which shall contain the customer's name, address at which service is provided, and the cut-off date. Written notice is waived if the Director determines exigent circumstances exist.
(b)
Involuntary Discontinuance. Service to any customer may be discontinued by the Utility for any one of the following reasons:
(1)
For misrepresentation in application as to property or fixtures to be supplied, or the use to be made of the water supply or character of waste discharged into the sanitary wastewater system;
(2)
For the use of water for any other property or purpose than that described in the application;
(3)
For willful or negligent waste of water;
(4)
For failure to protect the connection, service lines and fixtures, or to maintain them in good order;
(5)
For non-payment of any account for water or sewer service furnished, or of any scheduled fee or charge as required by the Utility's rate resolution, provisions of this ordinance, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the terms hereof, or any amendments thereto; however, the service will be discontinued five business days after the date of notice thereof but in any event prior to issuance of the customer's next successive month's bill, unless payment in full is received by the Utility;
(6)
For damaging any service pipe, meter, curb stop, seal, or any other appliance of the Utility controlling or regulating the water supply;
(7)
For violation of any provisions of this ordinance or amendments thereto;
(8)
For violation of any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder, including policies and resolutions of the Utility;
(9)
For turning off or on water at the "water main" or "water connection" or curb stop or for disconnecting or removing the meter by an unauthorized person without the prior written consent of the Director. Emergency cut-off of such water without damage to any Utility property shall not be considered a cause for discontinuance of service; or
(10)
In case of vacancy of premises.
(11)
If water is used without the knowledge of the Utility by any person, then the Utility upon discovery of the illegal water use, shall cause a charge to be made against the occupant of the property served for the time the water has been used as indicated from the last account of record. Water service shall be immediately discontinued and will not be restored to the occupant until all charges and fees have been paid.
(12)
If the sewer is used without the knowledge of the Utility by any person, then the Utility upon discovery of the illegal sewer use, shall bill the customer for the time the sewer has been used based on the last account of record. Services shall be discontinued and not resumed until all charges and fees have been paid.
(c)
The Director shall have authority to order the temporary discontinuance of water or wastewater service in any emergency, under exigent circumstances, or whenever such discontinuance is necessary for repairs or to protect life, health or property or to prevent immediate interference with the Utility systems. In such case, the Utility shall not be liable for any damage or inconvenience suffered by the customer; nor shall the Utility be liable for any claim against it at any time for interruption in service, lessening of the supply, inadequate pressure, quality of water, or wastewater flows for any causes beyond its control.
(d)
In all other circumstances service shall be discontinued only after five business days written notice delivered to an adult person occupying the premises served, or posted in a conspicuous place thereon, stating the reason for discontinuance and informing the user of his right to a hearing during regular business hours before the Director within such five days from receipt or posting of said notice.
2-16-65 - Increasing Rates.
Prior to any increase in the variable water consumption and wastewater discharge rates charged by the Utility to the public, a public hearing shall be had to allow public response. The hearing required herein may be held during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Commissioners of the Utility and must be attended by at least a quorum of the Commissioners to qualify as a hearing under this Section. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by publication in the official organ of Glynn County not more than 20 and not less than ten days prior the date of the hearing.
