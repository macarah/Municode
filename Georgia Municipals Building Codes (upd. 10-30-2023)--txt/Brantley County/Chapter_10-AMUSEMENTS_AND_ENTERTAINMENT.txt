Sec. 10-31. - Findings.
(a)
The board of commissioners, based on common knowledge, investigation, and experience derived from other local government jurisdictions, believes that adult entertainment establishments as defined in section 10-33, if unregulated, will likely lead to an increase in illegal sexual activities, drug and alcohol offenses, disorderly conduct, and other criminal activity.
(b)
Adult entertainment establishments sometimes are fronts for or operated by persons associated with criminal activities and the need to scrutinize such establishments is thereby enhanced in order to prevent the use of adult entertainment establishments for unlawful purposes.
(c)
The law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment establishments are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing adult entertainment establishments and those associated with them.
(d)
The public health, safety, welfare and convenience require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations, operations, and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm, and preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community.
(e)
It has been shown that the location of adult entertainment establishments in close proximity to each other adversely affects property values, causes an increase in crime and encourage residents and businesses therein to move elsewhere.
(f)
It is the duty of the board of commissioners to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, its residents, and the character of its neighborhoods and developments.
(Ord. of 2-20-1997)
Sec. 10-32. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is intended to represent a balancing or competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
