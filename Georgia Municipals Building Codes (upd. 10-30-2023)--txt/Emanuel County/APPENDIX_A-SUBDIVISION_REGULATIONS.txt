ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL

51.7 - Three Step Review.
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps. They are:
(a)
Review of sketch plans by the building official;
(b)
Review and approval of preliminary plat by county commission;
(c)
Review and approval of final plat by governing authority.
Steps (a) and (b) shall be completed prior to making any street improvement or installing any utilities. Step (c) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)
51.8 - Review Procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats:
51.8.1 Sketch plan review procedures. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the building official a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple free hand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The building official shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented.
51.8.2 Preliminary plat procedures. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the county administrator or the county commission at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the county commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six blue line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the county administrator shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the county commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefor.
Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the county commission. The above mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by this ordinance and additionally as deemed necessary by the county commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed, shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit to the county commission prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat.
The county commission shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after formal submission, and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefor. Failure of the county commission to act within 30 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the county commission on demand, provided, however that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period.
The action of the commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission meeting.
Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the county administrator on authorization by the county commission.
Also noted shall be the date on which the county commission granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of the preliminary plat to the county commission for approval.
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat.
Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department and road superintendent. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the county commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. However, if the subdivider fails to act within 180 days of the preliminary approval such approval shall become void unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the county commission.
51.8.3 Final plat procedure. The county commission shall examine the final plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, conforms to the approved preliminary plat, has approval of the health department and road superintendent, has been reviewed and approved by the local soil and water conservation district, design of the roads has been approved by the appropriate designated official, and whether streets and easements have been dedicated or qualify for dedication. If water or sewer system is to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system, who will operate it and what assurance will be given to the governing authority for continued operation. If roads are to be built, subdivider will indicate each subdivider's proposal for a bond to the governing authority to assure their proper and timely construction. If approved, a plat can be recorded in the clerk's office of the Emanuel County Superior Court upon authentication by the county administrator. For purposes hereof, authentication shall be in the following form to wit: Approved for recording on the ___ day of ________, 19___ by the appropriate governing authority.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)

  51.12.1 Final plat approval. The final plat shall be approved by the governing authority after review and approval by the following:
(a)
County administrator and road superintendent.
(b)
County board of health.
(c)
County Soil Conservation District when required.
(d)
Georgia Department of Natural Resources when required.
51.12.2 Permanent reference points. Prior to the approval of the final plat, all of the subdivision's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements:
51.12.2.1 Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or Georgia Grid System coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure.
51.12.2.2 Monuments.
(1)
Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of street and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line.
(2)
It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily re-established by reference to monuments along the sidelines of the streets.
(3)
All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground where practicable.
(4)
If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
(5)
All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half-inch in diameter and 24 inches long.
(6)
If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod, at least one-half-inch in diameter shall be drilled and groated into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches.

ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

51.13 - Required Improvements.
A well designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
51.13.1 Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.
51.13.2 Water supply. When a water system is installed in a subdivision with more than 20 lots, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for four minutes or 250 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be provided at distances not greater than 1,000 feet apart. When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots a water service line three-fourths-inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a municipal or county water system is not available, the county commission may make an exception to this rule.
51.13.3 Sanitary sewage. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.
51.13.4 Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans, and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county commission, and the county health department.
51.13.5 Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are installed, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect and approved by the county commission, or the local governing authority or its designee.
51.13.6 Street grading and surfacing. It shall be the subdivider/developers responsibility to pave all streets in subdivisions governed by this ordinance. Street grading, base preparation and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county administrator and road superintendent.
51.13.7 Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county administrator.
51.13.8 Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location, design and name shall be approved by the board of commissioners.
51.13.9 Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the soil conservation service.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)
51.14 - Final Plat Revisions.
If it should become necessary to revise a final plat due to a dimensional error, a revised plat shall be submitted to the county clerk of court for the final recording after the county commission has approved and signed the revised plat.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)
51.15 - Performance Bonds.
In lieu of the completion of required improvements and the installations previous to the final approval of a plat, the board of commissioners may accept a bond, in an amount and with survey and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the county a period specified by the county commission and expressed in the bond; and the county is hereby granted the power to enforce such bonds by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)
51.16 - Dedications.
After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the county or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street within the territorial jurisdiction of the county commission unless such street has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street prior to the attachment of the county commission's subdivision jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the local governing authority.
(Ord. of 5-21-2001)

Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only.
51.18.4 Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street name, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the county commission.
51.18.5 Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
51.18.6 Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable.
51.18.7 Cul-de-sac. A minor street provided with a turn-around having a roadway diameter of at least 50 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 80 feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turn-around having a 40-foot radius.

Except for local street, roadway widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles.
(2)
Right-of-way (henceforth referred to as R/W) width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in diagram. Sloping rights of additional R/W will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated R/W limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed.
(3)
R/W widths greater than "minimum" are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more "comfortable" facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property.
51.18.9 Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows:
EXPAND
Designed Speed
MPH Minimum
Curve Radii Minimum Stopping
Sight Distance

A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. On collector, industrial or commercial service street, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On minor streets, the center-line radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical.
51.18.11 Street grades. Grades on thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets should have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.
