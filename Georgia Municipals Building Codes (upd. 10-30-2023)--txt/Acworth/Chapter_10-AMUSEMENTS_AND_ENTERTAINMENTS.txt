DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-41. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority.
(a)
Based upon the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences the city believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of aldermen that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of such criminal behavior, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. This article is further adopted based upon specific evidence related to one of the clubs in Marietta, the Cyprus Lounge, which evidence is contained under table 1 of the information reviewed by the board of aldermen prior to this article. To that end, this article is adopted.
(b)
This article is also adopted pursuant to the authority granted by Ga. Const. art. III, § VI, ¶ VII.
(c)
This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare.
(d)
This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of the city.
(Ord. No. 97-005, 5-15-1997)
Sec. 10-42. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
