DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 22-151. - Findings.
(a)
The number of flea markets in the city has increased in recent years, the operation of which has become unduly distracting to motorists and has created traffic hazards and other problems in connection with their operation.
(b)
The general appearance of the city, and specifically areas surrounding flea market locations, is marred when operations are unsightly, inappropriate and poorly maintained, and when, in some instances, unsafe structures, sheds and sales areas exist, and debris and refuse accumulate. Failure to properly construct and maintain improvements upon the premises further detracts from the general appearance of the area and presents safety hazards.
(c)
The aesthetic quality and economic values of both commercial and residential areas surrounding flea markets, as well as the economy of the city, are adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets.
(d)
Lives and property are endangered by traffic created by flea markets that have been unregulated and uncontrolled, and by vehicles for which no provisions for parking and safe ingress and egress have been made by flea market operators.
(e)
Flea markets create difficulty in police supervision because of the lack of any controls over the number, identification and types of vendors and merchandise sold, and may become targets for the sale of, or dealing in, stolen merchandise.
(f)
Most flea markets fail to provide even minimum facilities for the protection of the health or comfort of persons on the premises, such as plumbing, electrical and bathroom facilities.
(g)
The public health, safety and welfare, and property values, in the city are detrimentally and adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets.
(h)
Unless steps are taken to ensure more satisfactory present and future operation of flea markets, the present appalling situation will become worse and more extensive through an increase in the number of flea markets, or further deterioration in flea markets already existing within the city.
(i)
In most instances presently existing, flea market operations are incompatible with surrounding land uses.
(j)
Many problems have been experienced within flea markets, particularly, but not limited to:
(1)
Temporary sheds or structures not intended to be permanent, which are constructed in an unsafe and unsightly manner;
(2)
Electrical, plumbing and other construction not complying with minimum codes, or which are built or improved without permits or inspections;
(3)
Failure to provide adequate parking;
(4)
Ingress and egress creating traffic hazards;
(5)
Lack of bathrooms, plumbing or sanitary facilities;
(6)
Failure to comply with commercial design standards;
(7)
Failure of vendors to obtain business licenses or to maintain records;
(8)
Failure to provide for minimum fire safety;
(9)
Failure to protect against wind uplift;
(10)
Difficulty of police supervision; and
(11)
Deterioration of surrounding property values.
(k)
There is a necessity for the adoption of an ordinance to regulate the location and operation of flea markets within the city in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens and the general public.

It shall be the duty of the flea market promoter, operator, owner or agent renting or providing space to verify that such license is in effect for each vendor. Failure to verify that each vendor has a valid business license, or the renting or provision of space for any unlicensed vendor to display or sell wares, shall subject the business license of the flea market operator, owner or promoter to revocation.
