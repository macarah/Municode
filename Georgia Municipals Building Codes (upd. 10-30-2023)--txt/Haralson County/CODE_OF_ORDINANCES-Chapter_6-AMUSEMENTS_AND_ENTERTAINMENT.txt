ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 6-1—6-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 6-19. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition because several court decisions have held that to do so would unlawfully cause to vanish what the courts have declared to be a constitutionally protected form of expression. As to adult erotic dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity, and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
