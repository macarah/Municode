Sec. 22-55. - Regulation as to employees and managers.
(a)
No person shall be employed by a pawnshop in any capacity until such person is found to be in compliance with the qualifications as described in this section and has paid the fee listed in the Snellville Police Department's Fee Schedule for a pawnshop work permit ID card, as approved by the mayor and council. This provision applies to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, and manager. Upon complying with the requirements of this chapter, a work permit ID card, authorizing such person to be a pawnshop employee will be issued. The work permit ID card will expire annually, and each holder will be required to renew the work permit ID card annually on or before the date of expiration. All persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, manager, and pawnbroker shall while on the pawnshop premises, have in their possession and available for inspection such work permit ID card. It shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to insure compliance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
The following qualifications shall apply to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee and manager:
(1)
No work permit ID card shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the Snellville Police Department, the chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also provide positive identification (only official government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g., driver's license, passport, military card, or state identification card).
(2)
The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant.
(3)
In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a work permit ID card to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and their right to appeal.
(4)
No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a work permit ID card for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(5)
No person shall be issued a work permit ID card if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the Snellville Police Department for said permit under this section.
(6)
All work permit ID cards issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee or the planning and development director or his designee.
(7)
Replacement work permit ID cards will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fees charged for work permit ID cards in subsection 22-55(a). After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(8)
All work permit ID cards issued hereunder remain the property of the Snellville Police Department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the Snellville Police Department.
(9)
No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid work permit ID card. Pawnshop owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current work permit ID card. For new employees, a receipt issued by the Snellville Police Department may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a work permit ID card, the applicant may appeal the denial of the work permit ID card as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the work permit ID card sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a work permit ID card under this chapter.
(10)
If it is determined that any person issued a work permit ID card has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the work permit ID card such work permit ID card shall be revoked or canceled.
(11)
Snellville employees who are directly involved in the issuance of work permit ID cards or in the regulation of pawnshops shall not be eligible for a work permit ID card.

No person shall be employed by a precious metals dealer in any capacity until such person is found to be in compliance with the qualifications as described in this section and has paid the fee listed in the Snellville Police Department's Fee Schedule for a precious metals dealer work permit ID card, as approved by the mayor and council. This provision applies to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, and manager.

The work permit ID card will expire annually, and each employee and/or manager will be required to renew the work permit ID card on or before the date of expiration. All persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, manager, and precious metals dealer shall while on the precious metals dealer premises, have in their possession and available for inspection such work permit ID card. It shall be the duty of the precious metals dealer to insure compliance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
The following qualifications shall apply to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee and manager:
(1)
No work permit ID card shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the Snellville Police Department, Chief of Police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also provide positive identification (only official government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g., driver's license, passport, military card, or state identification card).
(2)
The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant.
(3)
In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a precious metals dealer under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a work permit ID card to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a work permit ID card and therefore ineligible for employment in a precious metals dealer, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and their right to appeal.
(4)
No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a work permit ID card for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this article, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(5)
No person shall be issued a work permit ID card if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the Snellville Police Department for said permit under this section.
(6)
All work permit ID cards issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee or the planning and development director or his designee.
(7)
Replacement work permit ID cards will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fees charged for work permit ID cards in subsection 22-74(a). After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(8)
All work permit ID cards issued hereunder remain the property of the Snellville Police Department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the Snellville Police Department.
(9)
No precious metals dealer owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid work permit ID card. Precious metals dealer owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current work permit ID card. For new employees, a receipt issued by the Snellville Police Department unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a work permit ID card, the applicant may appeal the denial of the work permit ID card as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the work permit ID card sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a work permit ID card under this chapter.
(10)
If it is determined that any person issued a work permit ID card has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the work permit ID card such work permit ID card shall be revoked or canceled.
(11)
Snellville employees who are directly involved in the issuance of work permit ID card or in the regulation of precious metals dealer shall not be eligible for a work permit ID card.
