Sec. 2-84. - Debate.

During the course of a debate, council members may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the city council take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: Debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to the committee and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: Limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. Such motions require a second and cannot be debated.
(c)
Council members may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate.

Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-85. - Voting; procedure.
Voting on debatable motions and undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of the following two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other council member wishes to speak, the chairman may call for the vote; if there are no objections then the chairman may proceed with the vote.
b.
If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a council member may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the city council and ask for the votes of the council members.
(2)
Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the city council and then call for the vote.
(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-86. - Ranking of motions.
(a)
Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the city council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence.
(b)
A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section.

(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-87. - Subsidiary motions.
During the course of debate, council members may introduce motions which propose that the city council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the city council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions (amend, limit debate and vote immediately) also may apply to other subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered by the city council, such council member may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend. If a council member believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion.
a.
Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend.
b.
Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended.
c.
A motion shall not be amended more than two times.
d.
Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable.
e.
A majority vote is required for the city council to adopt an amendment.
f.
If the amendment is adopted, the city council shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a council member believes that further information is needed before the city council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the city council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(4)
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. Such motion is debatable and may be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the city council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the council member who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a council member believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the council member may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of majority of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the city council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-88. - Privileged motions.
Privileged motions facilitate the running of the city council meeting. Such motions do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on such motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a council member or of the city council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on such motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(3)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a council member must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result, it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.
(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-89. - Incidental motions.
Incidental motions allow council members to exert their rights as a member of the city council. Incidental motions may be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(1)
Appeal. If a council member disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairman, such council member may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the city council. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The city council may then debate the appeal. The city council shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and may only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(2)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a council member has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. Such question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the city council. Such motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. Such motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(3)
Point of order (question of order). If a council member believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman may make a ruling on the question or may allow the city council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order may only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(4)
Point of information (request for information). If a council member has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Ord. of 4-28-2003(2))
Sec. 2-90. - Supplementary main motions.
Three motions allow the city council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the city council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the following ways:
(1)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the city council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. Such motion allows the city council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any council member may make a motion to reconsider, and any council member may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the city council will return to debate and revote the original motion.
(2)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the city council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any council member. Such motion is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the council member seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-48. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If such motion is seconded, then the city council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(3)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the city council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. Such motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. Such motion is a main motion, but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.

(Ord. No. 2010-20, 11-11-2010)
Sec. 2-446. - Bids and proposals.
The two primary procurement methods for the City of Snellville shall be competitive sealed bidding and competitive sealed proposals. All procurements shall be made via one of these two methods unless the procurement falls under the sole source procurement, or emergency procurement sections above, which serve as exceptions to these two primary methods.
(1)
Competitive sealed bidding.
a.
An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid and such other relevant information as the city manager deems appropriate shall be recorded. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection.
b.
Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this division. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, no other criteria may be used in bid evaluation. Such requirements may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose.
c.
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bids shall be permitted unless the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: (1) the mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or (2) the bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by written determination by a city official.
d.
The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a given project exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the city manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
(2)
Competitive sealed proposals.
a.
When the city manager, or other relevant department head, determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method.
b.
As provided in a request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements.
c.
Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No factors other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in the evaluation.
