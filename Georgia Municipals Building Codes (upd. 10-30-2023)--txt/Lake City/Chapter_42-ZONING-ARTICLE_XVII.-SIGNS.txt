ARTICLE XVII. - SIGNS

Sec. 42-523. - Purposes.
The purposes of this article are as follows:
(1)
A comprehensive regulation is necessary because of the unique nature and history of the city in that a major commercial road runs through the center of the city and attracts signs that are inappropriately large, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values.
(2)
To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. The residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. City-wide regulations are necessary in view of the fact that very few areas are distinctly residential or distinctly commercial, and homes. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
(3)
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city.
(4)
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this article.
(5)
The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may exercise their right to freedom of speech and expression and convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The mayor and council intend, by enacting the ordinance from which this article is derived, to:
a.
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
b.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city;
c.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
d.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
e.
Promote economic development; and
f.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(6)
The provisions in this article which regulate signs on the basis of such factors as size, height, shape, design, spacing, placement, and distance, but not on the content of any message conveyed, provide an appropriate balance between the protection of the right to freedom of speech and expression via the sign medium and furthering the substantial governmental purposes stated herein.

(i)
No simulation of public signal. No sign shall be erected where due to its proposed location, position, shape, color, size, height, and/or lighting would appear to be in imitation of, or likely would be confused by motorists or pedestrians, for an official traffic control device or signal.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-01, § 1(art. XIX-A, § 19A.6), 7-8-2002; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002; Ord. No. 2016-3, § 1(exh. A), 4-11-2016)
Sec. 42-529. - Special requirements by zoning classification (see section 42-530 for additional requirements).
(a)
No sign shall be illuminated, either internally or externally, in any district zoned RS-200, RS-150, and RMH, except that entrance signs and subdivision signs may be illuminated from dusk until dawn.
(b)
All temporary signs are prohibited on lots zoned for residential use, except for stake signs as allowed in the charts contained in section 42-530.
(c)
Variances. This subsection shall provide the exclusive procedures for granting variances to the requirements of this article.
(1)
Upon application by the property owner of a lot zoned OI, BN, BG or M, covering more than ten contiguous acres, the mayor and council may grant a variance to allow the aggregate signable area to exceed 500 square feet where the applicant has shown that:
a.
All signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this article;
b.
The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, nor would it impair the purpose and intent of this article;
c.
The mayor and council shall consider at least one of the following factors:
1.
The size of buildings constructed on the subject lot;
2.
The potential to subdivide the lot; or
3.
The number of different tenants occupying the buildings.
d.
Financial loss to the appellant. However, such loss is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to justify a variance.
(2)
Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted.

Said notice shall include a brief and complete statement of the violations to be remedied. If the permittee, owner, or occupant of the property where the sign is located cannot be located, notice shall be effected by the city clerk or his designee affixing the notice to the sign or to the building on which the sign is erected.
(b)
If the permittee or property owner fails to remove or alter the structure so as to comply with the standards herein set forth within ten days after such notice, the permit for such sign shall be revoked and the permittee or property owner shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 42-535.

(1)
The owner of the sign shall secure a permit for the continuation of the sign subject to the restrictions of this section. Application for such permit must be filed within ten days of the notice of nonconformance. There shall be no charge for this permit. Failure to apply for such permit within ten days shall result in waiver of the protections afforded nonconforming signs by this section and the display of such sign shall be thereafter unlawful.
(2)
No change shall be made in the size of any , nor shall any structural changes be made in such a sign, unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this article.
(3)

A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.
(c)
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article.
(d)
Nonconforming signs which met all requirements of this Code when erected may stay in place until one of the following conditions occurs:
(1)
The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard; or
(2)
The sign has been damaged to such an extent that structural repairs are required to restore the sign. A structural repair is any repair necessary to maintain the stability of the sign and shall not be merely aesthetic in nature.
