(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from the location, size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area.
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar junkyard owners.
(3)
Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties or junkyard owners.
(4)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the public health or general welfare.
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of or aggravated by actions, failures, or omissions of the applicant, or such circumstances do not arise when there are pre-existing violations of any codes or laws by the applicant.
(6)
