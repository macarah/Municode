Sec. 30-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) below. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) below shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) below or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in the subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
Rules and regulations. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the manual for erosion and sediment control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) herein;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (16) below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 or Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Adoption of additional rules and regulations. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) herein.
(e)
Presumption of violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article of the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. O-2010-02, 5-20-2010)
Sec. 30-34. - Application and permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.

(Ord. No. O-97-004, 10-28-1997)
Sec. 30-73. - Forest service existing watershed protection efforts.
In response to the issue of how soil resources can be managed to prevent erosion and the reduction of water quality, the United States Forest Service's (USFS) Land and Resource Management Plan for the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests indicates that total sediment yield will decrease by an average of five percent from present conditions (1980s) through road closings and cable logging, and that wetlands and floodplains will continue to receive special management consideration. The land and resource management plan sets forth specific forest-wide standards and guidelines which address riparian area management. These protection measures include the following:
(1)
Erosion protection strips are applicable to define stream channels, wetlands, lakes and other bodies of water. The strip width is determined by land slope, as follows:
EXPAND
Percent Slope Recommended Minimum Width For Erosion Protection Strip
(Feet)
0  50
10  80
20 110
30 140
40 170
50 200
60 230
  (2)
Shade protection strips are applicable along perennial streams and cold water lakes and other water bodies to prevent increases in water temperature due to solar radiation in waters capable of supporting cold water fisheries. The width varies on small perennial streams with no fisheries to 80 feet on large perennial streams with high fishery values.
(3)
The plan supports the goal of meeting all federal, state and local water quality standards.
(4)
Temporary and sustained road grades of five percent or less are preferred with up to ten percent being permissible. Grades between ten and 20 percent can be for short distances of up to 300 feet. Grades exceeding ten percent (six percent on clays) will have a minimum gravel thickness of two inches for traction. Grades over 20 percent shall require the approval of the forest supervisor. (Roads typically produce 90 percent of the sediment to streams.)
(5)
Wheel or crawler vehicles used to log timber will not normally be operated within 40 feet of a stream (on zero to 20 percent slopes) or 80 feet (in 21—45 percent slopes).
(6)
Aerial pesticide application will be at least 100 feet from flowing streams or open water, logging debris that would damage fish habitat or channel stability will be kept out of defined stream channels, and portable sawmills shall be located at least 300 feet from streams and water bodies.
(7)
In water supply areas, no decrease will occur in the acres of hardwood types below 1980 levels, and increases in hardwood acres will be encouraged.
(Ord. No. O-97-004, § 1, 10-28-1997)
Sec. 30-74. - Applicability.

(Ord. No. O-97-004, § 3, 10-28-1997)
Sec. 30-76. - Exemptions.
The following uses shall be exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback provisions of this article:
(1)
Any land use within the Nottely River water supply watershed which was in existence prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Any undeveloped lot which is part of a subdivision plat recorded prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall also be exempted from this article and, provided, such activities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream as authorized by the state department of natural resources' rules for environmental planning criteria, chapter 391-3-16.
(2)
Agricultural and forestry uses, provided such activities are consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission or the state department of agriculture and, provided, such activities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream as authorized by the state department of natural resources' rules for environmental planning criteria, chapter 391-3-16.
(3)
Mining activities, if permitted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to the Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968, as amended.
(4)
Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems, railroads and other similar utilities and road crossings, if they cannot feasibly be located outside stream corridor buffer and setback areas, subject to the following conditions:
a.
The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible.
b.
The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible.

Sec. 30-77. - Buffers and setbacks.
(a)
Perennial stream corridors within a seven-mile radius upstream of the Blairsville water supply intake on the Nottely River shall be protected by the following provisions:
(1)
A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
(2)
No impervious surface shall be constructed within the 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
(3)
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 50-foot impervious surface setback area.
(b)
Perennial stream corridors outside a seven-mile radius upstream of the Blairsville water supply intake on the Nottely River shall be protected by the following provisions:
(1)
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
(2)
No impervious surface shall be constructed within the 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
(3)
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 50-foot impervious surface setback areas.
(Ord. No. O-97-004, § 5, 10-28-1997)
Sec. 30-78. - Impervious surface limitations.
Technical estimates by the Georgia Mountains RDS, based on detailed existing land use data by the Tennessee Valley Authority, indicate that impervious surface coverage within the Nottely River water supply watershed is only less than one percent of the entire land area within the watershed. This impervious surface area is therefore nowhere near the maximum of 25 percent recommended by the state department of natural resources, and therefor, no specific provisions to limit impervious surfaces in the watershed are needed. However, the county will monitor impervious surface coverage within the watershed at the time of each future update to the shortterm work program of the comprehensive plan, to determine if impervious surface area limitations may be necessary.

Sec. 30-115. - Other permitted uses.
Other uses permitted by the department of natural resources or under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act shall be permitted within the river corridor.
(Ord. No. O-97-003, § 5.0, 8-26-1997)
Sec. 30-116. - Establishment and maintenance of natural buffer.
Except for land uses specifically exempted by section 30-114, all construction of buildings or structures is prohibited within the river corridor, and the existing natural vegetative buffer within 100 feet of the stream bank shall remain undisturbed.
(Ord. No. O-97-003, § 6.0, 8-26-1997)
Sec. 30-117. - Assessment of potential development.
(a)
The portion of the Nottely River to which this article applies is a relatively short stretch, approximately 2.5 miles. The protected river corridor (100 feet on each side) contains about 2,640,000 square feet, or 60.6 acres of land. The first mile or so of this protected river corridor (the southern most section) is entirely contained within a 137-acre tract owned and managed by the United States Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This means that more than one-fifth, approximately 23 percent, of the corridor is undisturbed land owned and managed by the TVA.
(b)
In the remainder of the corridor, there are only seven tracts of land, the smallest being approximately 20 acres. Based on review of 1982 aerial photographs, all but one of such tracts appears to be largely cleared and utilized for agricultural land uses. Each of the seven parcels has some riparian vegetation left within the river corridor, although it appears to be less than 100 feet in many places. This article permits agricultural uses with only limited conditions. It is also evident from the dated aerial photographs that only one structure and one private driveway lies within the river corridor. There is only one public road crossing the river corridor and a portion of another public road existing within the river corridor.
(c)
For these reasons, it is apparent that existing development is not adversely impacting water quality in the river corridor. Future land use, as recommended in this article, is predominantly agricultural. Since agriculture is permitted in the river corridor with only limited conditions, implementation of this article would not be unduly restrictive on private property rights. In fact, it appears that only one private property could potentially implement the entire buffer, and that too could be encroached upon for agriculture or other exempted uses.
(d)
Land development, if consistent with this article, is not expected to adversely affect:
(1)
Unique/significant flora and fauna (none identified in the corridor);
(2)
The uses, activities and quality of Nottely River water;
(3)
Fishing or recreational uses (this segment is not a trout stream);
(4)
Historical and archeological sites (none identified in the corridor); or
(5)
Adjacent sensitive natural areas (none identified except floodplains).
Since floodplains are protected by chapter 34 of this Code, no adverse effects on floodplains are anticipated either.
(Ord. No. O-97-003, § 7.0, 8-26-1997)
Sec. 30-118. - Violation; penalties; enforcement.
(a)
Any person violating any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-12
(b)
The county erosion and sediment control officer, under the direction of the commissioner, will enforce the provisions of this article.

ARTICLE V. - MOUNTAIN PROTECTION PLAN

Sec. 30-151. - Purpose.
The mountains of the state are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land-disturbing activity on the high elevation, steep slope mountains of the state potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare and economic progress of the state. Such land-disturbing activity:
(1)
May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation;
(2)
Has the potential to induce landslides;
(3)
Has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation;
(4)
May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife, both plants and animal; and
(5)
May detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty which is vital to the local economy through the recreation and tourism industries.
To protect against such adverse effects, this chapter is adopted.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-152. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Protected mountain means all land area 2,200 feet or more above mean sea level that has a percentage slope of 25 percent or greater for at least 500 feet horizontally, and shall include the crests, summits and ridge tops which lie at elevations higher than any such area. The crests, summits and ridge tops of mountains whose flanks meet the criteria for a protected mountain shall also be included within the protected area, even though the slopes of such crests, summits and ridge tops have slopes of less than 25 percent. On an otherwise protected mountain, areas that are at an elevation of 2,200 feet or more, and have a slope of less than 25 percent, exclusive of valley floors, shall be included within the protected mountain area. For the purposes of this article, the term "valley floor" means a depression of the earth's surface where the slopes of mountains meet at a lower limit to become nearly level, and includes such associated areas at the base or toe of a mountain with a 10:1 (ten percent) slope or less. Illustration 1, attached to this article, provides a graphic of protected mountains in accordance with this definition. Illustration 2, attached to this article, indicates the angles of various slopes as a basis of comparison.

(1)
A detailed landscaping plan which identifies all trees which are to be removed that exceed eight inches in diameter as measured at a point on the tree 4½ feet above the surface of the ground, and shall contain a plan for replacement of any such trees that are removed (see illustration 4 attached to this article); and
(2)
A topographical survey of the projected site and an assessment of the effect that the project will have on the environment of the protected mountain after the project has been completed and is in operation.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require commercial structures to comply with the density limitations for single-family or multiple-family dwellings.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 4.6, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-163. - Tree removal without reforestation.
No person engaging in a land-disturbing activity on a protected mountain shall remove more than 50 percent of the existing trees which exceed eight inches in diameter as measured at a point on such tree 4½ feet above the surface of the ground, unless such person has filed with the application a plan of reforestation developed by a registered forester. (See illustration 5 attached to this article.)
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 5.1, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-164. - Height limitations.
Structures shall not extend more than 40 feet, as measured from the highest point at which the foundation of such structure intersects the ground, above the uppermost point of the crest, summit or ridge top of the protected mountain on which the structure is constructed. Such height limitation shall apply to water, radio and television towers, and electric transmission towers and lines. Such height restriction shall not apply to minor vertical projections of a parent building, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, antennas, poles, wires or windmills.

(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 5.3, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-166. - Public purposes and private property rights.
Land development and the commencement of other activities, if such development and activities are consistent with the mountain protection plan, will not have a negative effect on public health, safety or welfare. The application of mountain protection standards to land development and activities will not pose an undue burden on property owners, nor result in the diminishing of private property rights.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.1, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-167. - Conservation of unique flora and fauna.
The most significant areas of unique flora and fauna are located on lands owned and managed by the United States Forest Service. Rare and endangered species may be located within areas of protected mountains, although specific sites are not known. Land development and the commencement of other activities, if they are consistent with the mountain protection plan, should not have a negative impact on wildlife and plant and animal habitats. However, all of the county's protected mountains may have areas worthy of conservation.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.2, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-168. - Groundwater and surface water quality.
To a significant extent, groundwater and surface water are protected by existing state and federal regulations. Furthermore, much of the county's groundwater and surface water is protected through ownership and management by the U.S. Forest Service, through implementation of its land and resource management plan. Development and other activities consistent with the mountain protection plan will not have an adverse impact on protected mountains within the county.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.3, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-169. - Aesthetics.
The visual impact of development and activities consistent with the mountain protection plan should not be significant.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.4, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-170. - Historical and archaeological resources.
Historical and archaeological resources in the county are inventoried and assessed in the comprehensive plan. An analysis of the location of such resources indicates that historical and archaeological resources are predominantly located outside of protected mountain areas. The resources located within protected mountain areas are largely located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service in accordance with its land and resource management plan. Therefore, development consistent with the mountain protection plan is not expected to have any adverse impact on existing historical and archaeological resources.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.5, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-171. - Adjacent sensitive natural areas.
Sensitive natural areas on protected mountain areas of the county include wildlife habitats, rare natural communities, significant land forms and geological features, floodplains, wetlands and other such areas sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. Development consistent with the mountain protection plan is not expected to have adverse effects on sensitive natural areas.
(Ord. No. O-97-5, § 6.6, 11-25-1997)
Sec. 30-172. - Duration of impacts.
No significant impacts of an adverse nature on protected mountains of the county are anticipated if development conforms to the mountain protection plan. Any minimal impacts that might occur on protected mountains would be temporary.

ARTICLE VI. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 30-211. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Function means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map which is adopted in this definition as part of this article.
Hydric soils mean soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of such soils is maintained by the soil conservation service.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Amy Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or drill material into waters of the United States, except those activities exempted in section 30-216 and Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in this article.
Wetland means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas (33 CFR 32.93). The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. Freshwater wetlands do not include any areas defined as "coastal marshlands" by the Georgia Coastal Marshlands Protection Act.
Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation." Such map should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the commissioner.

Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2
Sec. 30-212. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined in section 30-211 and located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and the wetland protection district, and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter on such map and attached to such map, is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the commissioner.

Cross reference— Officers and employees, § 2-61 et seq.
Sec. 30-214. - District boundaries.
The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal and state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § IIB, 4-26-2001)
Sec. 30-215. - Local development permit required.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the commissioner or his designee. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the commissioner or his designee, using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § IIIA, 4-26-2001)
Sec. 30-216. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that such uses are not prohibited by any other article or law and, provided, they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided in this section:
(1)
Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting and reforestation practices, provided, they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided, they do not affect waters of the state or the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission.
(5)

Sec. 30-217. - Temporary emergency permit.
A temporary emergency permit can be issued in the wetland protection district by the commissioner or his designee for the following reasons:
(1)
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads, structures and facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the commissioner or his designee and, provided, the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired, and any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
(2)
Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided, they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected.
(3)
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided, the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 30-216
(4)
Limited excavating and filling which is necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water related structures, unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § IIIC, 4-26-2001)
Sec. 30-218. - Site plans.
Application for a development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet (the commissioner may approve a different scale where necessary to clearly provide the required information), which shall include the following information:
(1)
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.

All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § IIID, 4-26-2001)
Sec. 30-219. - Activities to comply with site plan.
All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of the site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the commissioner or his designee. The commissioner may require a bond up to the larger of $5,000.00 or $1,000.00 per acre of project area, and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions and limitations set forth in the development permit. The particular amount and conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of condition of any such bond, the commissioner or his designee may collect such bond or institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute such action to judgment and execution.
(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § IIIE, 4-26-2001)
Sec. 30-220. - Filing fee.
At the time of the application for a development permit, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the commissioner or his designee.
