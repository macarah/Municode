Chapter 10 - AMUSEMENTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 10-1—10-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 10-31. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
