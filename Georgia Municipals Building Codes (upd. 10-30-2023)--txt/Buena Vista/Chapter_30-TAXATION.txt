The basis for fair market value shall be 100 percent of the fair market value determined for the property by the county for county ad valorem tax purposes.
(c)
Appeal of assessment. Any taxpayer may appeal from an assessment by the county board of tax assessors to the county board of equalization as to matters of taxability, uniformity of assessment, and value, and the taxpayer or the county board of tax assessors may appeal to the superior court of the county for a decision of the county board of equalization. All such appeals shall be made in the manner provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-348.
(d)
When taxes due and payable. Ad valorem taxes shall become due and payable on December 20 of each year and shall be deemed delinquent if paid after January 1. Tax bills showing the assessed valuations, amount of taxes due, tax due dates, and information as to delinquency dates and penalties shall be sent to all taxpayers at least 30 days prior to the due date, but failure to send a tax bill shall not invalidate any tax. Delinquent taxes shall bear interest at nine percent per annum from the due date.
(e)
Failure to pay tax. The City shall forthwith issue an execution against any person who has defaulted in the payment of any ad valorem tax to be paid. The execution thus issued shall be a lien on all the property of such person, both real and personal, and shall be placed in the hands of the City officer responsible for collection by levy and sale.
(f)

All public property;

(b)
Sale by parcels. When not impracticable, all property sold for municipal taxes shall be so offered for sale that the smallest amount that will bring the amount of taxes and costs shall alone be sold.
(c)
Purchase by City. The City Clerk shall attend all sales of property for taxes due the City, and if no one person bids for the property put up to be sold as much as the tax due thereon, the Clerk shall place a bid for such property for the City, and if the bid is accepted, take custody of the deed for the City. No property so purchased by the City shall ever be sold by the City except at a public sale thereof to the highest bidder.
(d)
Redemption of property sold for taxes. Any person whose property is sold in obedience to an execution issued for the collection of municipal taxes shall have such rights of redemption of such property as are set forth in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 and any other provisions of law not inconsistent therewith.
