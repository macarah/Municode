ARTICLE XX. - VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION

Sec. 20-20.1. - Notice of intention to immobilize vehicles.
Whenever it is determined that a vehicle should be subject to immobilization, removal or impoundment because there are three or more outstanding, unpaid, overdue parking tickets, the latest of which has been unpaid for a period of at least 30 days, the following procedures shall be employed:
(a)
A determination shall be made of the license plate or manufacturer's ID number or such other information as may be obtained from a reasonable examination of the vehicle. The name and addresses of the responsible party shall be then determined from information made available by the motor vehicle registration or other appropriate licensing authority of the state in which the vehicle is licensed or such other source(s) as may be reasonably available. A prima facie presumption of the identity of the responsible party shall be established from such a determination. If it is determined that the vehicle is subject to any registered lien, any notice required pursuant to this article shall be transmitted to the lien holder, but the lien holder shall not be construed to be a responsible party. Any evidence that the ownership of the vehicle has changed as reflected on its registration records shall not relieve the responsible party from responsibility under this article for any violation occurring prior to such change in ownership.
(b)
A written notice shall be transmitted to the responsible party of the vehicle at the address of the responsible party as determined in accordance with the procedures in subsection (a). Notice shall be effected by certified mail, return receipt to addressee only, or by personal delivery with a certificate of the date, name, and address to whom delivery was effected or attempted. Notice to the owner shall constitute notice to the responsible party if other than the owner, it being the duty of the owner to so advise the responsible party. A return receipt specifying delivery was refused shall be deemed to have satisfied the provisions of this section. The written notice dated when transmitted shall contain the following information:
(1)
The license number of the vehicle or the manufacturer's ID number or if said numbers are missing, such other information to reasonably describe the vehicle.
(2)
The name of the registered owner of the vehicle and the responsible party if different or the registered owner is unknown.
(3)
The date and nature of each violation which establishes the grounds for the proceeding instituted pursuant to this article. A legible copy of each citation, subpoena or other document providing this information attached to the notice shall satisfy this requirement provided that the notice states the number of violations or other identifying information to permit reference to the attachments.
(4)
A statement that violation(s) exist(s), the proceedings or action that may be taken against the vehicle or the responsible party, a short summary of the title of this ordinance or the Columbus Code section in which the ordinance is codified and the penalties and procedures to which the vehicle or responsible party may be subject.
(5)
A statement giving notice that the party may avoid further penalties and procedures if all outstanding unpaid penalties, fines and costs for violations of the Columbus Code or state statute are paid in full within seven calendar days of the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notification made pursuant to this article are satisfied. Proposed further procedures may be suspended if a request for a hearing is filed with the Columbus Recorder's Court pursuant to section 20-20.4 within such time period.

(2)
State the total amount of civil penalties due for parking tickets that are overdue and unpaid that are attributable to such vehicle, in addition to an immobilization fee for the removal of the vehicle immobilization equipment; and
(3)
List the address and telephone number to be contacted to pay the charges to have the vehicle immobilization equipment removed.
(c)
If the civil penalties and the immobilization fee are not paid or satisfactory arrangements in lieu of payment are not made within 24 hours from the time of the attachment of the vehicle immobilization equipment, the vehicle may be towed and impounded.
(d)
Upon payment of all civil penalties, overdue and unpaid parking tickets, and the immobilization fee, the vehicle immobilization equipment shall be removed and the vehicle released to the registered owner or any other person legally entitled to claim possession of the vehicle. The fee may be paid in the form of a refundable bond pending the outcome of a hearing requested pursuant to section 20-20.5.
(e)
It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to tamper with, damage, remove, destroy or take the vehicle immobilization equipment placed on a vehicle pursuant to this section without all civil penalties and application charges having first been paid, or a bond posted. Columbus shall not be responsible for any damage to an immobilized vehicle resulting from unauthorized attempts to free or remove the vehicle.

(a)
The hearing shall afford a reasonable opportunity for person(s) to demonstrate by statements of witnesses and other evidence that the immobilization or impoundment of the vehicle is invalid or unjustified.

If the costs of immobilization or impoundment and the administrative fee have already been paid, the recorder shall direct that all such monies be refunded to whomever paid such monies.
(c)
If the recorder finds that the immobilization or impoundment of the vehicle was valid and justified, the recorder will direct that the vehicle continue to be held until all tickets, fines, immobilization fees, tow and storage charges are paid.
