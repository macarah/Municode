ARTICLE XX. - VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION

Sec. 20-20.1. - Notice of intention to immobilize vehicles.
Whenever it is determined that a vehicle should be subject to immobilization, removal or impoundment because there are three or more outstanding, unpaid, overdue parking tickets, the latest of which has been unpaid for a period of at least 30 days, the following procedures shall be employed:
(a)
A determination shall be made of the license plate or manufacturer's ID number or such other information as may be obtained from a reasonable examination of the vehicle. The name and addresses of the responsible party shall be then determined from information made available by the motor vehicle registration or other appropriate licensing authority of the state in which the vehicle is licensed or such other source(s) as may be reasonably available. A prima facie presumption of the identity of the responsible party shall be established from such a determination. If it is determined that the vehicle is subject to any registered lien, any notice required pursuant to this article shall be transmitted to the lien holder, but the lien holder shall not be construed to be a responsible party. Any evidence that the ownership of the vehicle has changed as reflected on its registration records shall not relieve the responsible party from responsibility under this article for any violation occurring prior to such change in ownership.
(b)
A written notice shall be transmitted to the responsible party of the vehicle at the address of the responsible party as determined in accordance with the procedures in subsection (a). Notice shall be effected by certified mail, return receipt to addressee only, or by personal delivery with a certificate of the date, name, and address to whom delivery was effected or attempted. Notice to the owner shall constitute notice to the responsible party if other than the owner, it being the duty of the owner to so advise the responsible party. A return receipt specifying delivery was refused shall be deemed to have satisfied the provisions of this section. The written notice dated when transmitted shall contain the following information:
(1)
The license number of the vehicle or the manufacturer's ID number or if said numbers are missing, such other information to reasonably describe the vehicle.
(2)
The name of the registered owner of the vehicle and the responsible party if different or the registered owner is unknown.
(3)
The date and nature of each violation which establishes the grounds for the proceeding instituted pursuant to this article. A legible copy of each citation, subpoena or other document providing this information attached to the notice shall satisfy this requirement provided that the notice states the number of violations or other identifying information to permit reference to the attachments.
(4)
A statement that violation(s) exist(s), the proceedings or action that may be taken against the vehicle or the responsible party, a short summary of the title of this ordinance or the Columbus Code section in which the ordinance is codified and the penalties and procedures to which the vehicle or responsible party may be subject.
(5)
A statement giving notice that the party may avoid further penalties and procedures if all outstanding unpaid penalties, fines and costs for violations of the Columbus Code or state statute are paid in full within seven calendar days of the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notification made pursuant to this article are satisfied. Proposed further procedures may be suspended if a request for a hearing is filed with the Columbus Recorder's Court pursuant to section 20-20.4 within such time period.

Sec. 20-20.2. - Immobilization of vehicles.
(a)
A parking enforcement officer of METRA may immobilize by the use of vehicle immobilization equipment any vehicle at the request of the Columbus Police Department or any vehicle that is parked in a parking enforcement district as set forth in Columbus Code section 20-13 if:
(1)
A notice has been sent pursuant to section 20-20.1;
(2)
Seven calendar days have elapsed from the date the notice was sent;
(3)

When attaching vehicle immobilization equipment to a vehicle, the officer shall affix notice to the windshield or other part of the vehicle so as to be readily visible. The notice shall:
(1)
Warn that the vehicle has been immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in damage to the vehicle;
(2)
State the total amount of civil penalties due for parking tickets that are overdue and unpaid that are attributable to such vehicle, in addition to an immobilization fee for the removal of the vehicle immobilization equipment; and
(3)
List the address and telephone number to be contacted to pay the charges to have the vehicle immobilization equipment removed.
(c)
If the civil penalties and the immobilization fee are not paid or satisfactory arrangements in lieu of payment are not made within 24 hours from the time of the attachment of the vehicle immobilization equipment, the vehicle may be towed and impounded.
(d)
Upon payment of all civil penalties, overdue and unpaid parking tickets, and the immobilization fee, the vehicle immobilization equipment shall be removed and the vehicle released to the registered owner or any other person legally entitled to claim possession of the vehicle. The fee may be paid in the form of a refundable bond pending the outcome of a hearing requested pursuant to section 20-20.5.
(e)
It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to tamper with, damage, remove, destroy or take the vehicle immobilization equipment placed on a vehicle pursuant to this section without all civil penalties and application charges having first been paid, or a bond posted. Columbus shall not be responsible for any damage to an immobilized vehicle resulting from unauthorized attempts to free or remove the vehicle.

(e)
For a partnership, the responsible party shall be the general partner or any employee who operates the vehicle in the course of the partnership's business or to whom the vehicle is generally made available; or

(g)
If it is determined that the vehicle is subject to any registered lien, any notice required pursuant to this article shall be transmitted to the lien holder, but the lien holder shall not be construed to be a responsible party.

(Ord. No. 04-9, § 1, 2-10-04)
Sec. 20-20.5. - Request for hearing on immobilization or impoundment.
(a)
After a responsible party or owner has received a notice under section 20-20.1 or after a vehicle has been immobilized or impounded pursuant to this article, the registered owner(s) and any other person(s) who reasonably appear to have an interest in the vehicle are entitled to request a hearing to contest the validity of the immobilization or impoundment of the vehicle. The request for a hearing must be in writing, signed, dated and will state the grounds upon which the person requesting the hearing believes the notice, immobilization or impoundment invalid or unjustified, and such other information as the director of METRA may require.
(b)
The recorder shall set and conduct a hearing on the matter within 21 days of receipt of a proper request filed pursuant to this section, except where a vehicle has not yet been released from impoundment, in which case the recorder will set and conduct the hearing within 72 hours of receipt of the request, not including Saturdays, Sundays, or federally sanctioned holidays.

Sec. 20-20.6. - Hearing procedure.
(a)
The hearing shall afford a reasonable opportunity for person(s) to demonstrate by statements of witnesses and other evidence that the immobilization or impoundment of the vehicle is invalid or unjustified. The recorder shall determine whether the immobilization or impoundment is proper and whether the removal, towing, storage, and administrative fees were or would be properly assessed. The recorder shall not have the authority to determine the validity of a parking citation unless the time for filing a request for a hearing on the parking citation has not passed, in which case the recorder has discretion to consolidate the immobilization/impoundment hearing and the parking citation hearing.
(b)
If the recorder finds that the notice, immobilization, or impoundment of the vehicle was invalid or unjustified, the recorder shall direct the immediate vacation of the notice or release of the vehicle, and the owner(s) or any other person(s) who have an interest in the vehicle shall not be liable for any tow or storage charges. If the costs of immobilization or impoundment and the administrative fee have already been paid, the recorder shall direct that all such monies be refunded to whomever paid such monies.
(c)
If the recorder finds that the immobilization or impoundment of the vehicle was valid and justified, the recorder will direct that the vehicle continue to be held until all tickets, fines, immobilization fees, tow and storage charges are paid.
(d)
The decision of the recorder shall be the final decision by the Columbus Consolidated Government. Any person aggrieved by the decision may file a petition for judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days from the final decision.
(e)
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) above, Columbus shall have no liability or responsibility for damage that may be caused by removal of a vehicle or for any towing or storage fees or charges.
