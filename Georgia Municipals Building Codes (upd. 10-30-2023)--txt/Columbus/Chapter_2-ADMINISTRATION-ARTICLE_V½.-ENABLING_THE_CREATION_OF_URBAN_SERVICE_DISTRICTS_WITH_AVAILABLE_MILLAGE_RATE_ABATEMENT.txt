Sec. 2-65.1. - Findings of necessary conditions, definitions, and criteria for millage rate abatement.
(a)
The Columbus Council finds that certain districts in Columbus, Georgia have not been subject to growth and development through private enterprise and would not reasonably be anticipated to be developed without the approval of new urban service districts which include a district redevelopment plan to improve property values, reduce poverty, reduce unemployment, relieve general distress and blight, and to relieve a substantial lack of economic development. Such districts may also include one or more natural, historical, or cultural assets which have not been adequately preserved or protected and such asset or assets would not reasonably be anticipated to be adequately preserved, protected, or improved without the approval of new urban service districts and appropriate urban service district redevelopment plans. Urban service districts may be created by the Columbus Council pursuant to Columbus Charter Section 1-103 and the provisions of this article.
(b)
Each urban service district must be created by an ordinance which includes a plat of the district and a district redevelopment plan. All parcels included in any urban service district must abut and may not contain a noncontiguous parcel. Each district so approved shall meet three or more of the following criteria:
(1)
The improvement of some real property in the district is likely to enhance the value of a substantial portion of the other real property in the district.
(2)
Pervasive poverty shall be evidenced in the district by showing that poverty is widespread throughout the district and shall be established by using the following criteria:
a.
The poverty rate shall be determined from the data in the most current of the United States decennial census prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Census or the American Community Survey and must be at least 13 percent of the residents of the district;
b.
Census geographic block groups with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the standards of subparagraph A. above.
(3)
Unemployment shall be evidenced in the district by the use of data published by the Office of Labor Information Systems of the Georgia Department of Labor indicating that the average rate of unemployment for the district for the preceding calendar year is at least ten percent higher than the state average rate of unemployment or by evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by significant job dislocation within the district such as the closing of a manufacturing plant or federal facility.
(4)
General distress in the district shall be evidenced by adverse conditions within the district other than those of pervasive poverty and unemployment. Examples of such adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, a high incidence of crime, abandoned or dilapidated structures, deteriorated infrastructure, and substantial population decline.
(5)
Underdevelopment in the district shall be evidenced by data indicating development activities, or lack thereof, through land disturbance permits, business license fees, building permits, development fees or other similar data indicating that the level of development in the district is lower than development activity within the consolidated government.
(6)
General distress and blight shall be present in the district and shall be defined as follows:
a.
The presence of structures, buildings, or improvements that by reasons of dilapidation; deterioration; age; obsolescence; inadequate provision from ventilation, light, air, sanitation, or open space; overcrowding; conditions which endanger life or property by fire or other causes; or any combination of such factors are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, high unemployment, juvenile delinquency, or crime and are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare;
b.
The presence of a predominant number of substandard, vacant, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures; the predominance of a defective or inadequate street layout or transportation facilities; or faulty lot layout in relation to size, accessibility, or usefulness;
c.
Evidence of pervasive poverty, defined as being greater than ten percent of the population in the area as determined by unemployment rate that is ten percent higher than the state average;
d.
Adverse effects of airport or transportation related noise or environmental contamination or degradation or other adverse environmental factors; or
e.
The existence of conditions through any combination of the foregoing that substantially impair the sound growth of the community and retard the provision of housing accommodations or employment opportunities.
(c)
The owner of each parcel or group of parcels in a designated urban service district may file an application on a form prescribed by the director the department of community reinvestment ("the director") for a temporary millage rate abatement on its real property ad valorem taxes for a period not to exceed ten years as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section below. For each application seeking a millage rate abatement, the director, will convene a panel consisting of the deputy city manager for planning and development and the director of the planning department, or their designees, to review the application and make an initial determination as to whether or not the planned acquisition and construction or rehabilitation of the property meets the definition of a significant impact project, moderate impact project or light impact project as defined below. Upon determination of the applicable millage rate abatement category or that the project does not qualify for a millage rate abatement, the director will notify the owner or agent of the panel's recommendation, and unless the application is withdrawn in writing within five business days, the director will present that recommendation to Council at its next meeting for its acceptance or rejection. At the time of the presentation, the owner or interested parties to the transaction may also be heard. After approval of any millage rate abatement by council, the owner or his/her agent will negotiate and enter into a developer agreement with the director which will contain ascertainable goals and requirements for each year of the project for which a millage rate abatement is sought and will specify the conditions triggering the first year of the millage rate abatement as well as penalties or other provisions for the recapture of millage rate abatements in the event the goals and requirements of the agreement are not met.
