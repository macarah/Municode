Sec. 6-402. - Effect; manner of repealing.
No ordinance adopted by an electoral vote as hereinbefore provided can be repealed or amended except by an electoral vote. But an ordinance to repeal or amend any such ordinances may, by resolution of the Council, be submitted to an electoral vote at any regular election, or at any special election called for some other purpose, provided notice of the intention so to do be published by the Council not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to such election. If an amendment is proposed such notice shall contain the proposed amendment in full. Such submission shall be in the same manner and the vote shall have the same effect as in cases of ordinances submitted to an election by popular petition.
Sec. 6-403. - Repeal by referendum; petition; contents; filing.
(1)
If, at any time within thirty (30) days after an ordinance passed by the Council becomes law, an unsigned petition requesting that such ordinance be repealed or amended as stated in the petition is filed with the clerk, and said petition after the filing of the same and within said thirty (30) days, is signed by qualified voters amounting to or exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the qualified voters as shown by the official registration list filed for the regular election of Councilors last held, the clerk shall thereupon certify said fact to the Council, and the ordinance shall no longer be operative until the steps indicated herein have been taken. Such petition shall have stated therein the names and addresses of at least five (5) qualified voters as a committee to represent the petitioners. Referendum petitions need not contain the text of the ordinance or ordinances the repeal of which is sought, but shall contain the proposed amendment, if an amendment is demanded, and shall be subject in all other respects to the requirements for petitions submitting proposed ordinances to, the Council. Ballots used in referendum elections shall conform in all respects to those provided for in Section 6-400(5) herein.
(2)
At the next meeting of the Council after said certification by the clerk, the Council shall proceed to reconsider the ordinance. If within thirty (30) days after the date of such certification by the clerk, the ordinance is not repealed or amended as requested, the Council shall provide for submitting the proposed repeal or amendment to a vote of the qualified voters, provided a majority of the committee named in the petition to represent the petitioners shall, by writing filed with the clerk within twenty (20) days after the expiration of said thirty (30) days, so require. In so doing the Council shall be governed by the provisions of Section 6-400(4) herein respecting the time of submission and the manner of voting on ordinances proposed to the Council by petition. If, when submitted to a vote of the qualified voters, such repeal or amendment is approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall thereupon go into effect as an ordinance of the consolidated government; but if any such amendment is clearly separable from the remainder of the ordinance and does not materially affect the other provisions of such ordinance, all sections of the ordinance except that sought to be amended and those dependent thereon shall be in effect as though no referendum of any portion of the ordinance had been contemplated; or if any such amendment or repeal of the ordinance is not approved by a majority of those voting therein, then the ordinance passed by the Council shall at once take effect.
(3)
Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the Council without change or passed in an amended form and not required to be submitted to a vote of the qualified voters by the committee of the petitioners shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as other ordinances. If the provisions of two (2) or more ordinances adopted or approved at the same election conflict, the ordinance receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.
