If, at any time within thirty (30) days after an ordinance passed by the Council becomes law, an unsigned petition requesting that such ordinance be repealed or amended as stated in the petition is filed with the clerk, and said petition after the filing of the same and within said thirty (30) days, is signed by qualified voters amounting to or exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the qualified voters as shown by the official registration list filed for the regular election of Councilors last held, the clerk shall thereupon certify said fact to the Council, and the ordinance shall no longer be operative until the steps indicated herein have been taken.

(3)
Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the Council without change or passed in an amended form and not required to be submitted to a vote of the qualified voters by the committee of the petitioners shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as other ordinances.
