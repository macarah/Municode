ARTICLE IV. - BIOMEDICAL WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL

Sec. 13-120. - Definitions.
Biomedical waste shall mean and include the following:
(1)
Pathological waste, which means all recognizable human tissues and body parts which are removed during surgery, obstetrical procedures, autopsy and laboratory procedures.
(2)
Biological waste, which means bulk blood and blood products, exudates, secretions, suctionings and other bulk body fluids.
(3)
Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuated vaccines; and culture dishes and devices used to transfer, inoculate, and mix cultures.
(4)
Contaminated animal carcasses, body parts, their bedding and other wastes from such animals which have been exposed to infectious agents, capable of causing disease in man, during research, production of biologicals or testing of pharmaceuticals.
(5)
Sharps, which means any discarded article that may cause punctures or cuts. Such waste includes, but is not limited to, items such as needles, I.V. tubing and syringes with needles attached, and scalpel blades.
(6)
Chemotherapy waste, which means any disposable material which has come in contact with cytotoxic/antineoplastic agents (agents toxic to cells) and/or antineoplastic agents (agents that inhibit or prevent the growth and spread of tumors or malignant cells) during the preparation, handling, and administration of such agents. Such waste includes, but is not limited to, masks, gloves, gowns, empty I.V. tubing bags and vials, and other contaminated materials. The above waste must first be classified as empty, which means such quantity that it is not subject to other federal or state waste management regulations prior to being handled as biomedical waste.
(7)
Discarded medical equipment and parts, not including expendable supplies and materials which have not been decontaminated, that were in contact with infectious agents.
(Ord. No. 91-24, 4-9-91)
Sec. 13-121. - Generation of biomedical waste.
(a)
The requirements of this article shall apply to all persons or facilities who generate biomedical waste. For purposes of this article, a facility is defined as one or more persons generating biomedical waste who share common waste management services including, but not limited to, bulk storage containers.
(b)
This article shall apply to all facilities generating regulated quantities of biomedical waste, including, but not limited to, clinics, dental offices, funeral homes, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), hospitals, laboratories, medical buildings, physicians offices, veterinary offices, research and manufacturing facilities, nursing homes, and blood banks.
(c)
In no case shall a person be a generator of biomedical waste if those wastes are generated from single-family residential premises or a single-family dwelling unit and disposed of as residential solid wastes.
(Ord. No. 91-24, 4-9-91)
Sec. 13-122. - Storage and containment.
(a)
Containment of biomedical waste shall be in a manner and location which affords protection from animals, rain and wind, does not provide a breeding place or a food source for insects and rodents, and minimizes exposure to the public.
(b)
Biomedical waste shall be segregated by separate containment from other waste at the point of origin.
(1)
Biomedical waste, except for sharps, shall be placed in containers which are impervious to moisture and have a strength sufficient to preclude ripping, tearing, or bursting under normal conditions of use. The containers shall be securely closed so as to prevent leakage or expulsion of solid or liquid wastes during storage, handling or transport.
(2)
Sharps shall be contained for storage, transportation, treatment and subsequent disposal in leakproof, rigid, puncture resistant containers which are taped closed or tightly lidded to preclude loss of contents.
(c)
Rigid containers of discarded sharps and all other disposable containers used for containment of biomedical waste shall be red or orange in color or clearly identified with the universal biohazard symbol or clearly marked with the word "biohazard."
(d)
Biomedical waste contained in disposable containers as prescribed above, shall be placed for storage, handling or transport in disposable or reusable pails, cartons, boxes, drums, dumpsters or portable bins. The containment system shall have a tightfitting cover and be kept clean and in good repair. The containers may be of any color and shall be conspicuously labeled with the universal biohazard symbol and the word "biohazard" on the sides so as to be readily visible from any lateral direction when the container is upright.
(1)
Reusable containers used for shipment of biomedical waste to a treatment facility or permitted sanitary landfill shall be thoroughly washed and decontaminated each time they are emptied unless the surfaces of the containers have been protected from contamination by disposable liners, bags or other devices removed with the waste.
(2)
Reusable pails, drums, dumpsters or bins used for containment of biomedical waste shall not be used for other purposes except after being decontaminated by procedures as described in this paragraph and after the universal biohazard symbol and word "biohazard" are removed.
(Ord. No. 91-24, 4-9-91)
Sec. 13-123. - Transfer of biomedical waste to off-site treatment or disposal facilities.
(a)
Any generator of biomedical waste shall transfer custody of the waste only to a collector who is operating under authority of the Rules of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Chapter 391-3-4. 15, Biomedical Waste.
(b)
Biomedical waste shall not be transported in the same vehicle with other solid waste unless the biomedical waste is contained in a separate, fully enclosed leakproof container within the vehicle compartment or unless all of the waste is to be treated as biomedical waste in accordance with the requirements of this regulation.
(c)
Biomedical waste shall be delivered for storage, including intermediate transfer, and treatment only to a facility or location for which there is a valid and appropriate operating permit as set forth in these rules.
(d)
Surfaces of transport vehicles that have contacted spilled or leaked biomedical waste shall be decontaminated.
(e)
Packaged biomedical waste may not be compacted or shredded prior to delivery to the treatment or disposal facility unless such compaction or shredding is in conjunction with chemical or other treatment which renders the waste noninfectious.
(Ord. No. 91-24, 4-9-91)
Sec. 13-124. - Treatment of biomedical waste.
(a)
If treated in accordance with the following procedures, the waste shall no longer be considered biomedical waste and may be combined and handled with regular solid waste. Biomedical waste shall be treated by one of the following methods prior to disposal at a permitted solid waste disposal facility.
(1)
Incineration in an incinerator which provides complete combustion of waste to render it nonpathogenic.
a.
Biomedical waste incinerators shall be capable of maintaining a minimum temperature in the primary chamber sufficient to destroy infectious agents and produce a residue essentially free of odors and unstable organic matter. If chemotherapy wastes are incinerated, the incinerator must be capable of maintaining a minimum of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit in the secondary combustion chamber and minimum residence time of two seconds.
b.
Atmospheric emissions shall be controlled so as not to exceed air quality standards of the Environmental Protection Division (EPD).
(2)
Decontamination by heating with steam under pressure (autoclave) so as to render the biomedical waste noninfectious.
a.
Recording of the thermometer during each complete cycle shall be used to ensure the attainment of a temperature of 121 degrees Centigrade (250 degrees Fahrenheit) for one-half hour or longer in order to achieve decontamination of the entire load.
b.
Monitoring of the steam sterilization process shall be required in order to confirm the attainment of decontamination.
c.
Monitoring may be through the use of biological indicators or other methods as approved by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
d.
Autoclave treatment of biomedical waste will be identified with the home address and phone number of the treatment facility and a statement affixed to the container certifying the contents have been decontaminated by heating with steam under pressure.
(3)
Other methods as may be approved by the DNR.
(b)
Biomedical wastes consisting of recognizable human anatomical remains shall not be disposed of by sanitary landfilling.
(c)
Chemotherapy waste, as defined in 13-120(f), shall be treated at a permitted incineration facility or other facility approved by the DNR. Steam decontamination may not be used for treatment of chemotherapy waste.
(Ord. No. 91-24, 4-9-91)
