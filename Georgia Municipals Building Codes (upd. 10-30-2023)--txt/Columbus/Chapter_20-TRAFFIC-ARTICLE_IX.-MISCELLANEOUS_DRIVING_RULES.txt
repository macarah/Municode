Editor's note— Ord. No. 10-5, § I, adopted Feb. 23, 2010 repealed the former § 20-9.46, and enacted a new § 20-9.46 as set out herein. The former § 20-9.46 pertained to thru truck routes; maximum weight, width, height and length limitations for trucks; authority to prohibit truck traffic on streets and avenues and derived from Ord. No. 74-45, §§ 1—6, 3-5-74; Ord. No. 83-62, § 1, 7-26-83; Ord. No. 94-38, § 1, 5-3-94.
Sec. 20-9.47. - Truck route system; thru truck routes; local truck routes; maximum weights, width, height and length limitations for trucks; authority to prohibit truck traffic on roadways.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the truck route system for Columbus Georgia is to regulate the streets and roadways on which commercial trucks and other vehicles are allowed to travel within the city limits. It is the intent of these regulations to establish two types of the truck routes for trucks to use. The first is to establish thru truck routes for trucks primarily traveling thru the city usually without a pickup or delivery within the city limits. The second is to establish local truck routes for trucks traveling within the city with pickups, deliveries, en route to headquarters, repairs or performing other business within the city limits. Trucks traveling along local truck routes shall use the highest street classifications and/or weight/length classification in the order of limited access/freeways to arterials to collector roadways to the nearest point of departure to their destination. Trucks traveling along arterial and collector roadways having the same weight and length restriction may travel in sequence of arterial to collector or collector to arterial. And to regulate streets and roadways establishing specific weights, length, width, height and other vehicle limitations to protect design life of city/county streets and roadways and the safety/welfare of the traveling public.
(b)
Maximum weight limitations. The Georgia Department of Transportation regulates the weight limitations on all interstates and state routes and therefore, is not regulated by this Code section. All motor vehicles in excess of weight limitation as prescribed by the Georgia Department of Transportation, which apply to state and federal routes (O.C.G.A. tit. 32, ch. 6, art. 2) are prohibited from using any street in Columbus, Georgia, except when applicable Georgia Department of Transportation permits have been secured by vehicles which are in excess of the provisions contained in the state law before said vehicles will be allowed to travel on the streets and roadways of the city.
(c)
Maximum width, height and length limitations. No vehicle using any public street within Columbus, Georgia, shall exceed a total outside width, including load thereon, of 102 inches, not including mirrors and accessories attached thereto; no vehicle unladen or with load shall exceed a height of 13 feet, six inches; no vehicle traveling on the Dwight D. Eisenhower system of interstate and defense highways unladen or with load shall exceed a height of 14 feet; no vehicle or combination of vehicles shall exceed a total length of 56 feet unless otherwise permitted by the Georgia Department of Transportation; single trip movements for necessary purposes of materials, objects or vehicle of dimensions which exceed the limits herein provided and which are of such nature that they cannot be readily dismantled or separated may be permitted, but only when applicable Georgia Department of Transportation permits have been secured. The state law provides that loads of poles, logs, lumber, structural steel, piping and timber may exceed the length fixed without requiring special permit. Truck lengths shall be measured in the following manner for maximum lengths: Single chassis vehicle's maximum length shall be measured from front bumper to rear bumper. Single chassis vehicles without rear bumpers shall be measured to the rear most permanently attached apparatus such as dump box, flat bed, enclosed body, lift gate, etc. Tractor trailer vehicle's maximum length shall be measured by the length of the trailer only not including the tractor.
(d)
Emergency restrictions. When the director of engineering and the traffic engineering manager determine that an emergency situation has arisen wherein trucks are damaging or destroying streets that are not designed or constructed to withstand heavy truck traffic, the traffic engineering manager is authorized to prohibit truck traffic to alleviate the situation. Such prohibition shall be defined and official traffic signs erected designating the maximum gross weight of vehicles to include load thereon, and/or maximum length. The traffic engineering manager shall report the same to the city council for confirmation by ordinance within 30 days of such emergency actions.
(e)
Exceptions to truck restrictions. Vehicles that are making pickups, deliveries or which have other specific business such as being en route to repairs or having headquarters not located on that specific street are exempt from this subsection provided that the driver can show proof of said business thru documents such as bills of lading. Trucks qualifying for trips defined by this exception shall use the truck route system using a route with the highest street classifications in the order of limited access/freeways to arterials to collector streets to the nearest point of departure to their destination.
(f)
Enforcement. The truck restrictions enumerated by this Code shall be enforced by the Georgia Department of Public Safety and by the city public safety officers. Violations may be determined using weight and/or length measuring devices. A vehicle shall be considered in violation of a weight restriction should the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) certification exceeds the weight limitation of the roadway on which the vehicle is traveling and/or stopped for investigation by a public safety officer.
(g)
Penalty for violation. Any person violating this section or any part thereof, shall, upon conviction before the city recorder, be punished as set forth in section 1-8 of this Code with the minimum fine being $100.00.
