(a)
Rate of leave. All city officials and permanent employees of the consolidated government, Columbus, Georgia, shall be entitled to sick leave with full pay computed on the basis on one-fourth day for each five work days of paid service.
(1)
Sick leave may be accumulated to an amount based upon the following stipulations:
The base accumulation shall be 30 working days.
Any sick leave used shall be from the base 30 days until the amount shall have been expended.
(2)
Accumulation above 30 days shall be handled in the following manner:
When a city official or an employee shall have accumulated 30 days of sick leave by the end of the last pay period in November, he may be paid in cash each year by December 25 for one-fourth of the accumulated sick leave beyond the base 30 days, and the other three-fourths above the 30 days shall be added to his sick leave reserve accumulation until a maximum of 60 days shall be attained in the reserve accumulation. At the end of each leave year all sick leave days above the maximum allowable reserve accumulation will be added to the catastrophic sick leave bank until a maximum of 120 days shall be attained.
No charge shall be made against the above sick leave reserve accumulation until the base accumulation of 30 days has been exhausted, and until a valid medical certificate has been presented as to the nature of the employee's illness.
(3)
In cases of emergency, city officials and employees who, because of protracted illness, shall have used all accumulated sick leave and vacation leave may be advanced sick leave by the director of administration. To assure as much uniformity as possible among the various city departments, requests for advanced sick leave shall be addressed by the appropriate department head to the personnel officer. In requesting an advance of sick leave, the department head shall submit the following facts for the consideration of the personnel officer:
The length of consolidated service of the employee, including prior service with the City of Columbus and/or Muscogee County.
The classification of the employee's position.
The sick leave record of the employee for the current and for the four preceding calendar years.
A medical certificate which shall include the nature of the illness, the prognosis and the probable date when the employee will return to work.
The personnel officer, upon investigation, shall make his recommendation to the director of administration. No advance of sick leave may be granted until an employee has completed at least five years of full-time work service. If approved, such extension shall be on the basis of one day at full pay for each completed year of full-time work service. In no case shall advance sick leave exceed 30 days at full pay. This sick leave shall be charged against future sick leave accruing to the employee and vacation leave, exclusive of one week of vacation each year. If city officials or employee's employment is terminated before the advanced sick leave has been repaid, deduction of one day's pay, based on the rate of pay at the time of termination, for each day advanced to him shall be made from the final pay or other sum due him or her.
(4)
Sick leave shall be charged by the hour for any portion of a work day but not less than 15 minute increments of an hour.
(5)
A city official or an employee who leaves the service of the government and is reemployed within 90 days and upon compliance with regulations then in force shall be credited with all unused and unpaid-for sick leave not to exceed 30 days.
(6)
Whenever a city official or employee of the government is granted a leave of absence without pay and returns to the service of the city at the conclusion of said leave, or has been laid off under the provisions of the merit system, upon reinstatement he shall be credited with all sick leave standing to his credit on the effective date of the beginning of his leave of absence or layoff. The city official or employee will not accrue sick leave during a leave of absence without pay or a layoff.
(7)
Reserved.
(b)
Reason for granting sick leave. A city official or employee eligible for sick leave with pay shall be granted such leave by the head of his department for the following reasons:
(1)
Personal illness, illness in connection with childbirth, injury, or absence necessitated by exposure to contagious disease so that the health of fellow employees may be endangered by attendance on duty.
(2)
Injury or illness of a member of the employee's family that requires the employee's personal care and attendance.
An employee's family is defined as:
(A)
Individuals related to each other by blood, marriage, or legal adoption as spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, father-in-law, and mother-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild, or
(B)
Another relative who has been in a parent-child relationship to the employee, or
(C)
Legal dependents of the employee as shown on the employee's most recent federal income tax return.
(3)
Death of a member of the employee's family, as defined in subparagraph (b) (2) above, plus grandparents (both natural and in-law), grandchildren, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law, shall entitle an employee to three days' leave.
(c)
Crediting of accumulated sick leave. All city officials and employees of the government shall be credited with all accumulated sick leave upon the effective date of these regulations. All amounts up to and including 30 days will be credited to the base fund. All amounts in excess of 30 days, not to exceed 60 days, will be credited to the reserve fund. Cash payments will not be made on any amount until December, 1972.
(d)
Certification by physician. An acceptable medical certificate signed by a licensed physician will be required of an employee by his department head to substantiate a request for sick leave for the following reasons:
(1)
Any period of absence consisting of more than five consecutive working days.
(2)
To support a request for sick leave during annual leave.
(3)
Leave of any duration if absence from duty recurs frequently or habitually provided the employee has been notified or warned that a certificate will be required.
(e)
Request for sick leave. To receive compensation while absent on sick leave, the employee shall notify the proper authority—immediate superior, division head or department head—as designated by the department head and within the time limit established by the appropriate department head. Each department head will notify the personnel officer in writing of the rules, as outlined above, established for his department. If such rules are changed or modified, the personnel officer shall be notified in writing.
(f)
Catastrophic sick leave. When an employee with a major illness or injury exhausts all available leave, to include sick, vacation and compensatory time, and remains unable to return to work as certified by a licensed physician, such employee may be paid from any accrued leave time in their catastrophic sick leave bank.
(1)
To receive benefits from their catastrophic sick leave bank employees must present medical certification to the human resources director that they are unable to return to work due to their own illness or injury.
(2)
A catastrophic illness or injury is usually life threatening and may leave significant residual disability or involve lengthy recovery and/or rehabilitation periods, and is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time or required the employee to receive care from a hospice or similar palliative care provider. Examples of illness or injury that qualifies for catastrophic sick leave include heart attacks, heart conditions requiring heart bypass or valve operations, congestive heart failure, most cancers, back conditions requiring extensive therapy or surgical procedures, strokes, severe respiratory conditions, spinal injuries, emphysema, severe arthritis, severe nervous disorders, and injuries caused by serious accidents.
(3)
If the human resources director determines that the injury or illness does not qualify for catastrophic sick leave benefits the employee may appeal that determination through the human resources director to the city manager. The human resources director will provide the employee leave request and all supporting documentation to the city manager for review. The decision of the city manager will be communicated to the employee by the human resources director and is final.
(4)
When employees are paid from their catastrophic sick leave bank their department is relieved of the payroll charge and may hire a temporary replacement for the employee on catastrophic leave.
(5)
Balances held in the catastrophic sick leave bank shall be treated the same as sick leave for incidents involving leave of absence, separation, reinstatement and reemployment.
