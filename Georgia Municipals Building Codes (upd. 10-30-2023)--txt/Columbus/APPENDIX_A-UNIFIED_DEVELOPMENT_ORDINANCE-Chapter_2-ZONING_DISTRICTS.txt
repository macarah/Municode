E.
Design Requirements/Access.
1.
Transportation/Infrastructure.
(A)
Vehicular Access to Site. Within the corridor, the subdivision of lots along an arterial road shall not be allowed if designed so that each lot has its own individual access to the major road unless approved by the Director of Engineering. Each pod of development, or if subdivided, each lot (including out parcels), must be connected with on-site access to a frontage road or interconnecting driveway, rather than directly to the arterial road.
(B)
Private Roadway/Driveways. All private access to U.S. Highway 80 shall be right-in/right-out and at intervals no closer than 300 feet as measured from the center-of-access to center-of-access roadway/driveways. Two-way access may be allowed at existing median breaks or at new median breaks at intervals of 1,320 feet only with the approval of the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Director of Engineering for the Columbus Consolidated Government.
(C)
Interparcel Access. All land parcels, excluding single-family residential, fronting the Corridor right-of-way shall have interparcel connectivity via either a frontage road or a travel way that is delineated from parking areas such that short trips between developments can be made without use of the major road within the Corridor. Within a focus area, development shall interconnect with the road or travel way network of any adjacent development or site within the focus area unless the Director of Engineering determines such connection would constitute an undue hardship.
(D)
Medians. Private roads and entrances to developments connecting with the arterial road in the Corridor or serving development in a focus area shall include center medians. Such roadway designs will be based upon projected traffic volume and the number of parking spaces. Medians are desired because they improve traffic safety and can be planted to enhance the overall appearance of the focus area, as well as provide refuge for pedestrians.
(E)
Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required as established under Chapter 7, Article 10 of the Unified Development Ordinance and shall be adjacent to all nonlimited access public rights-of-way.
(F)
Pedestrian Access. Pedestrian access should be provided to individual developments from any sidewalk, unless topography prohibits construction of facilities meeting Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Where medians are required, pedestrian access shall be provided across the median as approved by the Director of Engineering.

(E)
Trash areas shall be located at a minimum of 100 feet from any public road right-of-way.
5.
Parking/Yard, Height and Setback.
(A)
Location of Parking Areas. Buildings should be located at the corner of sites closest to the road intersection, so that the parking areas are screened by the building from view of any public road, and so that the travel path from public sidewalks is shortened. Parking must be located in a way that is not visually dominant. Parking between buildings and an arterial road is discouraged, but if necessary, requirements of section 2.5.19.E.5.(C) (Screening of parking areas) must be met. If parking is located in the side or rear yards, any screening may be clustered and need not cover 100 percent of frontage.
(B)
Up to 25 percent of the required parking spaces for any development may be reduced in total area, width, or depth for designated small vehicle parking. Each small vehicle parking space shall not be less than eight feet in width and 17 feet in depth.
(C)
All nonresidential developments shall meet at least one of the following requirements:
(1)
EXPAND
Gross Square Feet Maximum percent of Parking Spaces Allowed in Front of Buildings
