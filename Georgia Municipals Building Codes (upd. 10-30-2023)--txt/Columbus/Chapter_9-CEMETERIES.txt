Sec. 9-3. - Disposition of the remains of indigent persons.
In order to satisfy the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-12-5 and O.C.G.A. § 31-21-21, pertaining to deceased indigents, Columbus will undertake the following obligations. The determination of indigency will be made by the Columbus Office of the Department of Human Resources, Division of Family and Children Services (DFACS). Once that determination is certified by DFACS and provided to the cemetery sexton, Columbus will offer the following options to dispose of the remains:
(1)
Where the person asserting the right to direct the disposition of the body under O.C.G.A. § 31-21-7 ("the authorizing agent") authorizes cremation of the indigent, he or she must authorize the funeral home to release the cremains into the custody of the cemetery sexton in lieu of any other direction which might otherwise be made pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-18-80. The cemetery sexton will accept all indigent cremains for any indigent so certified by DFACS for storage in a vault. Upon notification from the sexton of acceptance of the cremains and certification from the funeral home that all necessary steps to apply for a death certificate have been completed, the director of public works shall pay the funeral home which provided the cremation service a fee of $600.00.
(2)
Where burial is requested by the authorizing agent, the cemetery sexton will provide a grave space and grave opening in the pauper burial ground. All indigents shall be buried at a time and date approved by the sexton. The funeral home which has custody of the body, and provides for its transportation and burial will receive a payment in the amount of $400.00 upon certification to the director of public works from the sexton that the burial is complete and certification of the funeral home that all necessary steps to apply for a death certificate have been completed.
(3)
Once the remains of an individual have been tendered to the city for burial or storage pursuant to subsections (1) or (2) above, any requests for the release of cremains, the marking of a burial plot, or the disinterment of a body for burial elsewhere will be made to the cemetery sexton who shall require reimbursement of any funds expended by the city in connection with the initial burial or cremation as well as any additional costs to be incurred by the city in accommodating the requested alternative disposition; provided however, the director of the department of public works will have the authority to waive some or all the required fees upon an administrative investigation and a finding that a full or partial waiver is warranted by the financial circumstances of the authorizing agent requesting such treatment and other compelling circumstances.
