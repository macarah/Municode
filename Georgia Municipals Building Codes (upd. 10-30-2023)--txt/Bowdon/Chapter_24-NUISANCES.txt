ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 24-1. - Nuisances defined.
A nuisance is anything which tends to lead to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in general, or which is manifestly injurious to the public health and safety, or tends greatly to corrupt the morals and manners of the people, with exception given to those rights protected in the Constitution. Nuisances include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Stagnant water on premises;
(2)
Dead or decaying matter left unattended;
(3)
Weeds or grass in excess of four inches on lots with a residence. For vacant lots in platted subdivisions, the limit for grass and weeds is 12 inches on the property. This requirement does not apply to properties used for agricultural purposes. The public officer shall have the discretion to waive this requirement to allow vacant lots to return to their natural state when:
a.
The configuration of the lots and the history of development within the subdivision are such that no substantial harm is caused to other lots in the subdivision and that development of the vacant lots is not imminent; or
b.
Additional green space will be created within a subdivision. The purpose of this waiver is to recognize that in some limited circumstances, it may be more appropriate to allow undeveloped lots to return to their natural state than to require unwanted and unnecessary maintenance;
(4)
Excess smoke or fumes caused by burning;
(5)
Maintaining a dangerous or diseased animal;
(6)
Maintaining chicken coops or other animals which tend to cause excessive odor or sound;
(7)
Obstruction of a public street, highway, sidewalk, or public right-of-way without a permit;

(9)
Any trees, shrubbery, or other plants which tend to obstruct clear, safe vision of roadways and intersections within the city;
(10)
Non-functioning appliances, major auto repairs, non-licensed and/or inoperable vehicles, or similar unsightly objects which are visible from the public street or neighboring property. Each of these objects must be stored in an enclosed accessory building or in an area not visible from public streets or neighboring properties;
(11)
Yard sales lasting longer than eight hours in any 24-hour period;
(12)
Debris or other household items that can be seen from the public street or neighboring property;
(13)
The pollution of public water or the injection of matter into the sewer system which would be damaging thereto;
(14)
Any major auto repairs such as building motors, transmissions, or heavy body work visible from the public street or a neighboring property. Such work shall be done in an enclosed accessory building or on a section of property not visible from the public street or neighboring property;
(15)
Abandoned mobile homes, manufactured homes, or recreational vehicles. No abandoned mobile home, manufactured home or recreational vehicle shall be used as storage or accessory building;
(16)
Any accumulation of trash, garbage, refuse, scrap building materials, paper, cardboard containers, brick, cement rubbish, tree residue, cans, containers, tires, discarded automotive parts or any other material that is a menace to public health and safety.
(17)
Any other condition constituting a nuisance under state law.

Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)

(h)
The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.

ARTICLE IV. - FORECLOSURE REGISTRY

Sec. 24-102. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The mayor and council find that there is a need to establish a foreclosure registry as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure.
(b)
Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The mayor and council find that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(c)
This foreclosure registry will require creditors or mortgagees to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed real property into compliance with applicable provisions of this article.
