ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 75-31. - Responsibility of building inspector.
On a day-to-day basis this chapter's provisions shall be administered by the building inspector, who shall have the following duties with respect to such administration:
(1)
Issuance of permits. Supervise the issuance of development and building permits so as to make sure that all new development and construction complies with this chapter. The building inspector should have permits reviewed, or at least comments regarding a permit application, ready for an applicant within 15 days.
(2)
Variances. Grant administrative variances (except for density and use variances) from the development standards of this chapter where, for reason of narrowness, shallowness, shape, the need to use septic tanks, topographic conditions or other conditions of the property, strict application of the development standards would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the property owner. In granting a variance, the building inspector may attach thereto any conditions that may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. The authority to grant variances shall be limited in scope when related to the following variance requests:
a.
Front, side or rear yard: The variance shall not exceed 50 percent of the minimum district requirements.
b.
Distance between buildings on same lot: The variance shall not exceed ten feet.
c.
Parking: The variance shall not exceed 50 percent of that required.
d.
No parking allowed in a required front yard in an O-I district: The variance may be approved to grant parking in a required front yard if a ten-foot buffer area is retained between future street right-of-way and parking area.
e.
Minimum single-family lot area required to be above and spaced a distance of the dwelling unit from intermediate regional flood contour elevation: The variance shall be limited to reducing the minimum single-family lot area required to be above the intermediate regional flood contour elevation to 50 percent and the distance of a dwelling unit from the intermediate regional flood contour elevation to the minimum yard requirements of applicable zoning districts, and only upon written approval of the county engineer and/or sanitarian.
(3)
Inspections. Make field inspections to determine that the building, construction or structural alteration or use is being pursued in accordance with the site plan for which a development or building permit has been issued and in compliance with this chapter. These inspections and reports of findings shall be made as soon as practicable after inspection is requested by the developer. When a violation is found to exist, the building inspector shall immediately advise the chairman of the city council of the violation so that appropriate legal action may be taken to ensure compliance.
(4)
Certificate of occupancy. Ensure that all construction has been completed in accordance with all applicable laws and requirements prior to allowing occupancy by way of issuance of a certificate of occupancy, which authority shall include the right to refuse to allow hookup to public utilities until compliance has been obtained. The code enforcement officer shall have the primary authority and responsibility to investigate complaints about noncompliance with this chapter and to notify the building inspector of any violation so that appropriate legal action may be taken.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-32. - Development permit required.
A development permit shall be required for any proposed use of lands or buildings, if the building inspector requires, to indicate and ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter before any building permit is issued or any improvements, grading or alteration of lands or buildings commences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, approval of a comprehensive site land disturbance permit, approval of a preliminary/final plat in accordance with all applicable provisions of the subdivision regulations and approval of a planned development shall constitute approval of the development permit for such subdivision or development, and development permits for individual structures within this approved subdivision or planned development shall not be required to be presented with an application for a development permit for a single-family dwelling unit on an individual lot or tract not part of an approved subdivision or planned development.
(1)
Application. All applications for a development permit shall be made to the building inspector and shall be accompanied by complete plans drawn to scale, in duplicate, and signed by the author with his address, showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact sizes and locations on the lot of the buildings and accessory buildings then existing and the lines within which the proposed building or structure shall be erected or altered, the existing or intended use of each building or part of building, the number of families or housekeeping units the building is designed to accommodate and such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter. One copy of these plans shall be returned to the owner when these plans shall have been approved.
(2)
Issuance. All development permits shall be issued by the building inspector, who shall in no case grant any development permit for the use, construction or alteration of any land or building if the land or building as proposed to be used, constructed or altered would be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, conditions of zoning imposed upon the property, or any other codes and laws of the city or the state, except as provided in this section.
(3)
Duration of validity. A development permit shall be valid for one year from its issuance, subject to the following provisions. If the work described in any development permit has not begun within 90 days from the date of issuance thereof, this permit shall expire. If the work described in any development permit has not been substantially completed within one year of the date of issuance thereof, this permit shall expire. Written notice of the expiration shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that further work as described in the cancelled permit shall not proceed until a new development permit has been obtained. The foregoing expiration provisions shall not apply to a planned development, which instead must be substantially completed within five years.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-33. - Building permit required.
It shall be unlawful for any building to be located, erected, moved, expanded or structurally altered for a cost in excess of $1,000.00 unless a permit is specifically required herein (ex. temporary electrical pole, moving building on or across public thoroughfares, etc.) without obtaining a building permit issued by the building inspector in conformity with this chapter. All permits issued shall be conspicuously posted and displayed on the premises described in the permit during construction or reconstruction. Any building permit shall automatically expire six months from the date of issuance if construction is not substantially complete. Construction or reconstruction not in compliance with the building permit issued, or without a building permit as required in this section, shall constitute a misdemeanor for which the violator, if found guilty, may be punished as provided by law. Each day upon which a violation occurs shall be considered a separate offense under this section. Building permit applications shall be accompanied by two copies of a dimensional sketch or preliminary site plan, signed by the owner or his authorized agent, and include at a minimum the following:
(1)
Lot dimensions with property line monuments located thereon;
(2)
Shape, size, height and location of the structures proposed to be erected, demolished, altered or moved, and of any buildings already on the lot; yard dimensions and the use of structures, including the number of dwelling units within each structure;

Computations, stress diagrams, shop drawings, floor plans of existing buildings to which additions are proposed and other data necessary to show compliance with the building code shall be included when required by the building official. Any specifications in which general expressions are used to the effect that "work shall be done in accordance with the building code" or "to the satisfaction of the building official," shall be deemed imperfect and incomplete, and every reference to the building code shall be by section or subsection number applicable to the materials to be used, or to the methods of construction proposed.
(d)
The building official may authorize the issuance of a permit without plans and specifications for minor alterations, repairs and small or unimportant work, but in no instance where the work is of a structural nature. The issuance of a permit without plans and specifications will still require the necessary inspections and compliance with the building code and all other pertinent regulations.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-37. - Examination of plans.
The building official shall examine all plans and applications in the order received, except those plans that have been previously examined.

Plans that are rejected, as stated in this section, may be returned for correction of the tracings. Penciled notations on such plans may be accepted for only minor corrections. If the application, plans and specifications meet the approval of the building code, the plans shall be stamped "approved," and the permit shall be issued by the building official.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006)
Sec. 75-38. - Approval of other authorities.
In addition to verifying compliance with the building code, the building official shall require that the laws, rules and regulations of any other regulatory authority having jurisdiction, where such laws, rules and regulations are applicable and are known to him, shall be satisfied before a permit shall be issued. He shall require such evidence, as in his opinion is reasonable, to show such other approvals. The building official shall not thereby be held responsible for enforcement of such other regulations, as he is not specifically authorized to enforce. The following are some, but not necessarily all, other agencies having jurisdiction on some or all projects:
(1)
The road department, the sheriff's office, the state highway department, and the city's police department for the moving of buildings, structures and heavy equipment over, temporary construction over, storage of material on, construction operations over or temporary blocking of streets or other public spaces;

(1)
Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this chapter, was a lot or plat of record; or
(2)
Where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the development requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, and undue hardship upon, the owner of this property, which difficulty or hardship is not the result of acts of the applicant; and further provided that this relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter and is not contrary to the public welfare.
In granting a variance, the planning and zoning commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. However, the planning and zoning commission shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a density or use in a district in which the density or use is otherwise prohibited.

(5)
Effect on legal proceedings. An application for interpretation, variance, conditional use permit or appeal stays all legal proceedings unless the building inspector certifies after the application shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(6)
Appeals to city council.
a.
It is the intention of this division that from a decision of the planning and zoning commission, recourse shall be had to the city council by filing notice of appeal with the building inspector within ten days of the decision appealed from. Any person, firm or corporation aggrieved by a decision of the planning and zoning commission may take an appeal to the city council. The authority to file an appeal shall also be granted to the building inspector or any member of the city council. This appeals process does not apply to rezoning amendment matters; it only applies to decisions of the planning and zoning commission concerning variances, conditional use permits, questions of interpretation and appeals taken by it.
b.
The office of the city council shall schedule a hearing on the appeal to be held within 30 days of the date the appeal is filed. This appeal also shall be accompanied by a fee set by the city council to partially defray the public expense in processing the application. The fee shall not be required for an appeal filed by the building inspector or a member of the city council.
c.
Advance notice of the city council's hearing on appeal shall take the form of such notice or advertising as is required by subsection (a)(3) of this section.
d.
An appeal shall not stay the effectiveness of any approved variances, conditional use permits, and questions of interpretation that is the subject of the appeal. However, the owner of property who has received the variance, permit or favorable interpretation shall proceed at his own risk that a revocation of the same may occur and development may be halted when the appeal is resolved.
(7)
City council's action on conditional use requests. Before taking action on a proposed conditional use request and after receipt of the building inspector and planning and zoning commission recommendations and any reports thereon, where required, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposal. At the public hearing the city council shall review documents submitted by the initiating party, if any, and the report prepared by the building inspector and the planning and zoning commission. So that the purpose of this chapter will be served and the health, public safety, and general welfare secured, the city council may approve or deny the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, add or delete conditions/standards required under this section, defer its vote to another hearing, or allow an application to be withdrawn without prejudice with respect to the 12-month limitation to this chapter. An action to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered. However, if the second public hearing will allow continued presentation of positions or information by the proponents and opponents, the deferred hearing also shall be re-advertised in compliance with subsection 75-63(f)(1).

Unless the prior official zoning maps have been lost or wholly destroyed, such documents or any remaining significant parts thereof, shall be preserved, together with any significant records pertaining t the adoption or amendment, as a guide to prior zoning status of areas.
