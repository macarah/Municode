Chapter 53 - SOLAR ENERGY
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 53-1. - Purpose.
An ordinance to update the Code of the City of Eatonton, adding a chapter to permit solar energy systems as permitted, conditional, and special exception uses in any zoning district, and to add requisite definitions therein.
This chapter aims to promote the accommodation of distributed, on-site residential and non-residential solar energy systems installed to reduce on-site energy consumption and associated equipment, as well as adequate access to sunlight necessary for such systems.
This chapter permits, depending on zoning district, solar energy systems, while protecting the safety and welfare of adjacent and surrounding land uses through appropriate zoning and land-use controls.
A solar energy system shall be permitted in any zoning district as an accessory use, subject to specific criteria as set forth below. Where general standards and specific criteria overlap, specific criteria shall supersede general standards.
(Amd. of 2-2-2016)
Sec. 53-2. - Definitions.
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Accessory use. A subordinate building or use which is customarily incidental to the principal use or building, and which is located on the same lot with the principal use or building, as defined in section 75-4(c) of this Code.
Battery back-up. A battery system that stores electrical energy from a solar PV system, making the electricity available for future use. Battery back-up systems are common in off-grid systems and hybrid systems.
Combiner or junction box. Combines the inputs (electrical flows) from multiple strings of solar panels (or micro-inverters) into one output circuit.
Crystalline silicon cells. Solar photovoltaic cells fashioned from either mono-crystalline, multi-crystalline, or ribbon silicon capable of converting sunlight into electricity. Crystalline silicon solar PV panels are the most commonly used and are generally the most efficient.
Distributed solar. For the purposes of this chapter, distributed solar refers to solar energy systems located on-site and designed to provide solar thermal energy or solar PV electricity to a property owner, occupant, and/or facilities.
Grid-tied solar. A solar PV system that is interconnected with the utility grid via net metering and interconnection agreements with the utility.
Electricity generation (a.k.a. production, output). The amount of electric energy produced by transforming other forms of energy, commonly expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatt-hours (MWh).
Electrical equipment. Any device associated with a solar energy system, such as an outdoor electrical unit/control box, that transfers the energy from the solar energy system to the intended on-site structure.
Grid-tied solar photovoltaic systems (a.k.a. grid-tied PV, on-grid, grid-connected, utility-interactive, grid-intertied, or grid-direct). Solar photovoltaic electricity generation systems designed to serve the electricity needs of the building to which it is connected, thus offsetting a home's or business's electricity usage. Any excess electricity generated is sent to the electric utility grid, credited via a customer's net metering agreement with their local utility. Grid-tied are typically installed without a battery back-up system to store electricity. As such, these systems provide no power during an outage. Typical system components: PV panels, inverter(s), and required electrical safety gear.
Ground-mount system. A solar energy system that is directly installed on specialized solar racking systems, which are attached to an anchor in the ground and wired to connect to an adjacent home or building. Ground-mount systems may be applicable when insufficient space, structural and shading issues, or other restrictions prohibit rooftop solar.
Hybrid solar photovoltaic systems (a.k.a. grid-tied PV with battery back-up). Solar photovoltaic electricity generation systems designed to serve the electricity needs of the building to which it is connected, thus offsetting a home's or business's electricity usage, while also utilizing a battery back-up in the event of a power outage. This is the only system that provides the ability to have power when the utility grid is down. Typical system components include: PV panels, inverter(s), and required electrical safety gear, battery bank, and a charge controller.
International Residential Code (IRC). Part of the International Building Code (IBC), the IRC sets buildings standards for residential structures.
Inverter. A device that converts the direct current (DC) electricity produced by a solar photovoltaic system to useable alternating current (AC).
Kilowatt (kW). Equal to 1,000 watts; a measure of the use of electrical power.
Kilowatt-hour (kWh). A unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt of power expended for one hour of time.
Mounting. The manner in which a solar PV system is affixed to the roof or ground (i.e. roof mount, ground mount, pole mount).
Megawatt (MW). Equal to 1,000 kilowatts; a measure of the use of electrical power.
Megawatt-hour (MWh). A unit of energy equivalent to one megawatt of power expended for one hour of time.
National Electrical Code (NEC). Sets standards and best practices for wiring and electrical systems.
Net meter. On-grid solar PV systems connected to the utility grid use a net meter; typically provided and installed by the local utility, to measure the flow of electricity from the solar system for the purposes of net metering.
Net metering. A billing arrangement that allows customers with grid-connected solar electricity systems to receive credit for any excess electricity generated on-site and provided to the utility grid.
Off-grid solar photovoltaic systems with battery back-up. Solar photovoltaic electricity systems designed to operate independently from the local utility grid and provide electricity to a home, building, boat, RV (or remote agricultural pumps, gates, traffic signs, etc.). These systems typically require a battery bank to store the solar electricity for use during nighttime or cloudy weather (and/or other back-up generation). Typical system components include: PV panels, battery bank, a charge controller, inverter(s), required disconnects, and associated electrical safety gear.
Orientation (or azimuth). In the northern hemisphere, true solar south is the optimal direction for maximizing the power output of solar PV. Although, systems can be oriented east, southeast, southwest, and west, while still providing 75—85 percent of maximum production, depending on the tilt. Proper orientation and access to sun are critical for achieving maximum energy production potential (ideally, the orientation of the solar energy system ensures that solar access is not obstructed by other buildings, shade trees, chimneys, HVAC systems, or other equipment).
Passive solar. Techniques, design, and materials designed to take advantage of the sun's position (and the local climate) throughout the year to heat, cool, and light a building with the sun. Passive solar incorporates the following elements strategically to maximize the solar potential of any home or building (namely, maximizing solar heat gain in winter months and minimizing solar heat gain in summer months to reduce heating/cooling demand; and maximizing the use of daylighting to reduce demand for electricity for lighting): strategic design and architecture, building materials, east-west and building lot orientation, windows, landscaping, awnings, ventilation.
Photovoltaic (PV) system. A solar energy system that produces electricity by the use of semiconductor devices, called photovoltaic cells, which generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. A PV system may be roof-mounted, ground-mounted, or pole-mounted.
Pole-mount systems. A solar energy system that is directly installed on specialized solar racking systems, which are attached to a pole, anchored and firmly affixed to a concrete foundation in the ground, and wired underground to an attachment point at the building's meter. Unlike ground-mount systems, pole-mount systems are elevated from the ground. Pole-mounted systems can be designed to track the sun (with single-axis or dual-axis tracking motors) and maximize solar output throughout the year.
Power. The rate at which work is performed (the rate of producing, transferring, or using energy). Power is measured in watts (W), kilowatts (kW), megawatts (MW), etc.
Public utility. Any utility regulated by and under the jurisdiction of the public service commission pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 46-1-1 et. seq.
PV-direct systems. The simplest of solar photovoltaic electric systems with the fewest components (no battery back-up and not interconnected with the utility) designed to only provide electricity when the sun is shining. Typical system components include: PV panels, required electrical safety gear, and wiring.
Racking. Solar energy systems are attached securely and anchored to structural sections of the roof-mounted or pole-mounted systems. Specially designed metal plates called flashings prevent leaks and are placed under shingles and over bolts to create a water-tight seal.
Roof-mount system (a.k.a. rooftop mounted, building mounted). A solar energy system consisting of solar panels are installed directly on the roof of a home, commercial building, and/or an accessory structure, such as a garage, pergola, and/or shed. Solar panels are mounted and secured using racking systems specifically designed to minimize the impact on the roof and prevent any leaks or structural damage. Roof-mount systems can be mounted flush with the roof or tilted toward the sun at an angle.
Solar access. The ability of one property to continue to receive sunlight across property lines without obstruction from another's property (buildings, foliage or other impediment).
Solar array. Multiple solar panels combined together to create one system.
Solar collector. A solar PV cell, panel, or array, or solar thermal collector device, that relies upon solar radiation as an energy source for the generation of electricity or transfer of stored heat.
Solar easement. An easement recorded pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 44-9-20—44-9-24, the purpose of which is to secure the right to receive sunlight across the real property of another for the continued access to sunlight necessary to operate a solar energy system. According to Georgia law, parties may voluntarily enter into written solar easement contracts that are enforceable by law. An easement must be created in writing and filed, duly recorded and indexed in the office of the recorder of the county in which the easement is granted. A solar easement, once created, runs with the land and does not terminate unless specified by conditions of the easement.
Solar energy system. A system capable of collecting and converting solar radiation into heat or mechanical or electrical energy and transferring these forms of energy by a separate apparatus to storage or to point of use, including, but not limited to, water heating, space heating or cooling, electric energy generation, or mechanical energy generation. This definition shall include solar thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar systems.
Solar energy system, small-scale. An active solar energy system that occupies 1,750 square feet of surface area or less (equivalent to a rated nameplate capacity of about ten kW DC or less).
Solar energy system, medium-scale. An active solar energy system that occupies more than 1,750 but less than 40,000 square feet of surface area (equivalent to a rated nameplate capacity of about 10—250 kW DC).
Solar energy system, large-scale. An active solar energy system that occupies more than 40,000 square feet of surface area (equivalent to a rated nameplate capacity of about 250 kW DC or greater).
Solar farm. A large-scale utility and/or commercial solar energy system, the full size of which is six acres or more.
Solar glare. The potential for solar panels to reflect sunlight, with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) system. Solar systems consisting of photovoltaic cells, made with semiconducting materials, that produce electricity (in the form of direct current (DC)) when they are exposed to sunlight. A typical PV system consists of PV panels (or modules) that combine to form an array; other system components may include mountain racks and hardware, wiring for electrical connections, and power conditioning equipment, such as an inverter and/or batteries.
Solar panel (or module). A device for the direct conversion of sunlight into useable solar energy (including electricity or heat).
Solar process heat. Technologies that provide industrial specific applications, including ventilation air preheating, solar process heating, and solar cooling.
Solar-ready. The concept of planning and building with the purpose of enabling future use of solar energy generation systems. Solar-ready buildings, lots, and developments make it easier and more cost-effective to utilize passive solar techniques and adopt active solar technologies in the future. Solar-ready buildings are built anticipating future installation of active solar energy systems (including structural reinforcement, pre-wiring or plumbing for solar, and east-west building orientation). Solar-ready lots are oriented to take maximal advantage of a location's solar resource. Solar-ready developments expand this concept to entire subdivisions.
Solar thermal system (a.k.a. solar hot water or solar heating systems). A solar energy system that directly heats water, or other liquid using sunlight. Systems generally consist of a series of tubes that concentrate light to heat either water or a heat-transfer fluid (such as food-grade propylene glycol, a non-toxic substance) in one of two types of collectors (flat-plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors). The heated liquid is used for such purposes as space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and heating pool water.
Thin film solar PV. Capable of generating electricity from the sun, thin film solar PV cells consist of layers of semiconductor materials (made from amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium diselenide, among other materials) a few micrometers thick, which allow for greater flexibility. Thin film is made by depositing one or more thin layers of photovoltaic material on a substrate; products include rooftop shingles and tiles, building facades, the glazing for skylights, and other building integrated materials.
Tilt. The angle of the solar panels and/or solar collector relative to their latitude. The optimal tilt to maximize solar production is perpendicular, or 90 degrees, to the sun's rays at true solar noon.
True solar noon. When the sun is at its highest during its daily east-west path across the sky (this is also known as 0° azimuth). Solar energy systems can be manually or automatically adjusted throughout the year. Alternatively, fixed-tilt systems remain at a static tilt year-round.
Watts (W). A measure of the use of electrical power (power (watts) = voltage (volts) X current (amps).
Wiring. Specified by electrical codes, solar PV system wires are routed from the panels or micro-inverters through conduit into the inverter and buildings meter.

Where reasonable and appropriate, new subdivisions should be platted so as to preserve or enhance solar access for either passive or active systems, consistent with the other requirements of the Eatonton Code.
(f)
The plan for development of any site within cluster subdivisions shall be designed and arranged in such a way as to promote solar access for all dwelling units. Considerations may include the following:
(1)
In order to maximize solar access, the higher-density dwelling units should be placed on a south-facing slope and lower-density dwelling units sited on a north-facing slope.
(2)
Subject to the Eatonton setback requirements, structures should be sited as close to the north lot line as possible to increase yard space to the south for reduced shading of the south face of a structure.
(3)
A tall structure should be sited to the north of a short structure.
(g)
Solar-ready zoning should be considered as one among multiple considerations in planning new developments.
