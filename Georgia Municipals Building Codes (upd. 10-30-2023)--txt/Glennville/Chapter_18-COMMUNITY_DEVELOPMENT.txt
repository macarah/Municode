Sec. 18-32. - Purpose and scope of article.
It has been found by the mayor and council that there is a need for revitalization in certain areas of the city.

This article should be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes.

Sec. 18-33. - Boundaries of enterprise zone.
The mayor and council have determined that the area contained in the enterprise zone delineated below satisfies three of the four criteria set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6. More specifically, it is determined that there is evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by significant job dislocation within the area delineated below, there is evidence of general distress within the area other than poverty and unemployment, and there is evidence of underdevelopment within the area showing that the level of development in the nominated area is at least 20 percent lower than the development activity within the city as a whole.

Sixty percent of the state and county ad valorem taxes shall be exempt for the next (eighth) year;
(4)
Forty percent of the state and county ad valorem taxes shall be exempt for the next (ninth) year; and
(5)
Twenty percent of the state and county ad valorem taxes shall be exempt for the last (tenth) year.
(b)
A qualifying business or service enterprise is an enterprise which increased employment by five or more new full-time job equivalents in the enterprise zone designated in section 18-33 and which enterprise provides additional economic stimulus in such enterprise zone. The quality and quantity of such additional economic stimulus shall be determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the mayor and council or its designated agent. Such business or service enterprise may be a new business or service enterprise, an expansion project for an existing business or service enterprise, a reinvestment into an existing business or service enterprise, or a successor to such business or service enterprise. At no time shall this article be construed to apply to a business or service enterprise's land, buildings, equipment or other property that existed at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived unless such business or service enterprise qualifies under subsection (d) of this section. Whenever possible, ten percent of the above-described new full-time job equivalents shall be filled or staffed with low-income or moderate-income individuals.
(c)
For a qualifying business or service enterprise located within the enterprise zone designated herein, the schedule provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall begin in the calendar year of said enterprise's designation as a "qualifying business or service enterprise" by the mayor and council or other designated agent. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as giving any business or service enterprise or property owner a vested right to be designated as a qualifying business or service enterprise. A minimum of five new jobs must be created and maintained for a qualifying business or service enterprise to maintain eligibility for the tax exemption provided in this article. Evidence of the creation and maintenance of all new jobs within the enterprise zone shall be submitted to the mayor and council or its designated agents by the qualifying business or service enterprise at such times as required by said mayor and council or its designated agents, and no less frequently than annually. The qualifying business or service enterprise shall submit a form, substantially similar to that attached to Ordinance No. 00-15 as Exhibit "B" to the mayor and council or its designated agent. Annually, qualifying business or service enterprise will submit an "annual job retention worksheet and certification" on a form substantially similar to Exhibit "C" attached to Ordinance No. 00-15 to the mayor and council or its designated agent.
(d)
If a project within the designated enterprise zone consists of rehabilitation and improvement of an existing structure and the value of said improvement exceeds the value of the accompanying tract or parcel of land by a ratio of five to one, then the exemption schedule in subsection (a) of this section shall also apply whether or not the rehabilitation project is carried out by a qualifying business or service enterprise. The tax exemptions pursuant to this subsection shall commence in the year following designation of the project by the mayor and council or other designated agent as a qualifying project under this subsection.
(e)
In no event shall the value of the property tax exemptions granted within the city as a whole exceed ten percent of the value of the property tax digest of the city.
