Sec. 62-374. - Development requirements.
The general plan for new C-3 highway oriented commercial districts shall include evidence and facts showing that it has considered and made provision for, and the development shall be executed in accordance with the following essential conditions:
(1)
Generally. It shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses (see section 62-372) and grouping of buildings, service and parking areas, circulation and open spaces, planned and designed as an integrated unit (or to facilitate the ultimate creation of an integrated unit) in such a manner as to constitute a safe, efficient and convenient highway oriented commercial district.
(2)
Unified architectural unit. The proposed development or lot shall be constructed in accordance with an overall plan and shall be designed as a unified architectural unit with appropriate landscaping.
(3)
Loading and unloading areas. Adequate areas shall be provided for loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other vehicles, service by refuse collection, fuel, fire and other vehicles, automobile accessways and pedestrian walks. All areas provided for use by vehicles and all pedestrian walks shall be constructed in accordance with state highway department specifications. Service areas shall be screened from view from any abutting roadway and from within the parking area.
(4)
Ingress and egress. Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to and from public highways serving the district without undue congestion to or interference with normal traffic flow.
(5)
Access barrier. Each lot or center with its buildings, other structures, and parking and loading areas, shall be physically separated from each adjoining highway or street by a curb or other suitable barrier including a landscape buffer strip against unchanneled motor vehicle ingress or egress. Such a barrier shall be located at the edge of the street line unless suitable curbs and gutters are provided within the highway or street right-of-way. Except for the accessways permitted below, such barrier shall be continuous for the entire length of any lot line adjoining a street or highway.
(6)
Accessways. All permanent points of vehicular access to and from the public streets shall be located not less than 200 feet from the intersection of any public street lines; except that access may be permitted to a minor or secondary street within not less than 100 feet of its intersection with the major highway. All accessways shall comply with the following requirements:
a.
Width. The width of any accessway leading to or from a street or highway shall not exceed 36 feet nor be less than 15 feet in width at the right-of-way. The alignment of accessways and curb dimensions shall be determined through architectural and site approval.
b.
Spacing. In C-3 districts no parts of any accessway shall be nearer than 20 feet to any other accessway on the same lot, nor shall any part of an accessway be nearer than ten feet to any side or rear property line at its intersection with a street line. Insofar as practicable, the use of common accessways by two or more permitted uses shall be encouraged in order to reduce the number on closeness of access points along highways.
c.
Marginal access drives (or service streets). A 20-foot wide marginal access drive may be required to reduce the number of accessways and improve vehicular circulations within the C-3 district. This drive would be located adjacent to the landscaped buffer area and extended parallel to the street line of the major highway. Access to this facility from the parking areas of the commercial establishments shall be located to facilitate traffic movement between the major highway (or intersecting road), the marginal access drive, and the parking area. Prior to granting of approval of a development plan, the city shall ensure that adequate legal provisions are considered concerning the use, ownership and responsibility of the marginal access drives.
(7)
Parking areas. Parking areas shall be located and designed to facilitate the interchange of vehicular movement between the major highway, the marginal access drive and the parking area as well as from one parking area to another provided the second lot is located on adjacent C-3 district zoned land, C-3 uses which do not require patron parking facilities in the normal sense (such as service stations, and drive-in theaters) are encouraged to locate at the extremities of the district to ensure the continuity of the parking facilities.
(8)
On-street parking. No on-street parking is allowed on any public highway, road or street upon which a C-3 district abuts.
(9)
Lighting. Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect the highway and neighboring properties from unreasonable direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind.
(10)
Screening. The C-3 district shall be permanently screened from adjoining and contiguous residential districts by a wall, fence, evergreen hedge and/or other suitable enclosure of minimum height five feet and maximum height seven feet, placed at least two feet inside the C-3 district property line. The area between such enclosure and the property line shall be landscaped to form a permanent screening area. The board of appeals may waive the requirement for a screening enclosure and/or screening area if equivalent screening is provided by existing parks, parkways, recreational areas, or by topography or other natural conditions.
(11)
Water and sewer. No facility permitted in a C-3 district shall be erected or used that is not adequately served with both sanitary sewers and public water unless authorized as a special exception and upon submission of satisfactory evidence to the fact that sanitary sewers and public water supply are not feasible in the particular location in question. Such evidence may include, but not be limited to, a specific recommendation from the city engineer, local health officer, official representative of the state health department and/or sewer authority.
(12)
No split district. For the purpose of calculating the minimum area, lot dimensions and yard requirements established by this section, a C-3 district cannot lie on two sides of a public street or alley. Any area designated as being a C-3 district and lying on both sides of a public street shall be deemed to be two C-3 districts, and all minimum requirements shall be met by buildings on each side of said public street as separate districts.
(13)
Drainage. The development plan shall include provisions for handling surface water drainage compatible with the topography of the lot and surrounding development.

DIVISION 12. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 62-451. - Declaration of legislative intent.
The legislative intent of the PUD district is to permit great flexibility in the use and design of structures and land in situations where modification of specific provisions of this chapter will not be contrary to its intent and purpose or significantly inconsistent with the planning on which it is based and will not be harmful to the neighborhood in which they occur.
(Ord. of 2-7-1997, § 1400)
Sec. 62-452. - Use regulations.
The planning commission may authorize uses not permitted in the district where the lot is located, provided that such uses are desirable or convenient for the users of the lot as developed or the immediate neighborhood, and provided that such uses are planned to ensure that they will not materially alter the existing character of the neighborhood. However, uses not permitted in the district where the lot is located shall not be permitted to occupy more than ten percent of the lot area nor more than ten percent of the building floor area. Where the planning commission determines that the application is consistent with section 62-451 and with the other requirements hereof, it shall enter an order authorizing development and use in accordance with the site plan and description contained in the application, modified as the planning commission may require to carry out the intent and purpose of this division and containing any conditions or restrictions which the planning commission may consider necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
