Sec. 1.1. - Purpose.
The purpose of the Quality Development Corridor Overlay District (QDC) is to provide for a superior environment along transportation corridors through the application of an overlay district. The overlay zone regulations are intended to supplement the regulation of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for harmony and compatibility of non-residential uses over the length of the corridor. This district is established to protect the public investment in major highways and county roads and ensure that these can continue to serve their primary functions of moving volumes of traffic safely. The intentions of the provisions of the QDC is to expedite the free flow of traffic and reduce the hazard arising from unnecessary points of ingress and egress and cluttered roadside non-residential uses. The intention of this district is to enhance the value of adjacent lands by preserving and extending the useful life of the highway, avoiding land uses that conflict with the roadside and the surrounding area and reducing the risks of creating blighted areas. Insuring the attractiveness of roadside uses will contribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment, general welfare and public safety.
