ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 10-146. - Findings; public purpose.
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; Amarillo and Beaumont, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, California; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Fayetteville, it is the finding of the council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
( Ord. No. 0-26-21 , Art. 2(Exh. A), 11-18-21)

d.
Provided, however, that random acts of patrons or employees, whose actions do not constitute actions taken pursuant to encouragement or acquiescence of the management of the establishment and are not for the purposes of entertainment, promotion, publicity, or notoriety for the establishment shall not constitute the forms of behavior regulated by this article; provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed to make legal any conduct that may otherwise be prohibited by law.
(3)
