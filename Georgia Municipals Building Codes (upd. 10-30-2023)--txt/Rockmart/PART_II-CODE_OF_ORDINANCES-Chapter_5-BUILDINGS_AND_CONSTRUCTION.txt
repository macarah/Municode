  Note to Table 5. The five permitted zones for freestanding signs are described in attachments "A" through "E" of the ordinance from which this section is derived.
(1)
Location. If a lot has more than one street frontage and a freestanding sign is proposed on each street, then the freestanding sign allowed on each frontage can be no closer to the intersection of said streets than one-half the distance of the frontage on each street.
(2)
Regulations within corporate limits. Freestanding signs that are authorized within the corporate limits of the city shall be subject to the following regulations:
a.
All signs shall be constructed in an area that maintains a protective fall zone. That is, if the sign falls in any direction from its highest points, no building, parking lot, sign, or other improvement shall be located within the fall zone so that persons or property could be injured and/or damaged as a result of the falling sign. The fall zone shall be calculated by taking 1½ times the height of the sign and drawing a circle with that radius around the sign's proposed centered location.
b.
Freestanding signs shall be permitted within five zones (see Table 5) within the city. The description of each zone is attached and made a part of this article by reference. The city reserves the right to amend, restrict, or expand any freestanding sign zones.
c.
In zones 2, 4 and 5 all freestanding signs shall have at least 300 feet of distance between the signs, in addition to meeting all fall zone regulations set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
d.
No signs shall be lower than two feet off the ground, nor higher than 25 feet.
e.
No sign may be located so as to impair, in any way, traffic visibility at intersections where freestanding signs are allowed.
(c)
Billboards. Billboards shall be allowed only in C-2 and C-3 zoning districts and must have at least 2,500 feet of distance between the signs, in addition to meeting all fall zone regulations set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section. No billboard shall be higher than 35 feet, measured from the ground to the top of the sign.
For the purposes of determining the required distances between billboards, distance shall be measured from the center of each billboard. Further, such measurement shall be by line of site or shortest distance, whichever is less. For purposes of enforcing the 2,500 feet of distance between billboards, the term billboard shall refer to any sign within or outside of the city limits that meets the definition of "billboard sign" in section 5-41 herein so that no billboard shall be allowed if there is another billboard within 2,500 feet no matter if the existing billboard is located within or outside of the city limits. The above manner of measuring distance applies only to the measurement of distances between signs and it is not applicable to any other section of this code requiring distance measurements.

(1)
Wall signs shall have an aggregate area not to exceed two square feet for each linear foot of building face parallel to a street lot line, not to exceed 200 square feet in area. Where a lot fronts on more than one street, the aggregate sign area facing each street frontage shall be calculated separately. Canopy and awning signage shall be deducted from allocated wall sign area.
(2)
Height. Wall signs that project more than four inches from the building surface on which it is attached shall be at least eight feet above the finished elevation at its lowest extremity. The signs shall not be higher than the vertical wall to which it is attached.
(3)
Wall, canopy or awning signs shall not have interchangeable copy unless approved as a marquee sign.
(4)
Marquee wall signs may be substituted for wall signs for approved uses such as theaters and hotels where their use is customary. Such signs shall not extend above the roofline of the building nor extend more than two feet away from the face of the building upon which the sign is secured. Allowable sign dimensions shall be the same as for wall signs.
(5)
No wall sign shall project more than 24 inches from the building face on which it is attached.
(6)
No wall sign shall be closer than 18 inches to an adjacent property line and shall not be installed over a party wall.

(5)
The distance from the building wall to the sign shall not exceed six inches.
(6)
The height of the top edge of the sign shall not exceed the height of the wall from which the sign projects, if attached to a single story building, or the height of the sill or bottom of any second story window, if attached to a multistory building.
(7)
The sign may be directly or indirectly lighted; however, direct lighting shall be of the sign copy only.
(Ord. No. 7-2003, § 1(5.57), 7-10-2003)
Sec. 5-53. - Grand opening signs.
Property owners in commercial districts may exhibit banners, flags, portable signs, balloons, streamers, or inflatable devices within two months of starting the operation of a new business or for any significant change in the business.

(Ord. No. 7-2003, § 1(5.58), 7-10-2003)
Sec. 5-54. - Nonconforming signs.
(a)
Grandfathered signs. Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this article, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming grandfathered signs and may remain, except as otherwise specifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced or altered in any manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall it permit the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair.
(b)
Maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to excuse a property owner from keeping nonconforming signs in good repair. No repairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep of nonconforming signs shall be permitted to make the sign comply with the requirement of this article. A nonconforming sign which has been declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not be repaired, rebuilt or restored unless such repair or restoration will result in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this article.
(c)
Relocation. A nonconforming sign shall not be moved or otherwise relocated for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article.
(d)
Removal, destruction or discontinuance of use. If a nonconforming sign is removed or destroyed or the use of the sign is discontinued for any period of time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a replacement sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or toppled by an act of God; weather, or whatever other means, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason to grant a variance to re-erect the nonconforming sign.
(e)
Replacement by a conforming sign. A nonconforming sign that is changed to, or replaced by, a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be subject to the provisions of this article.

Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(1)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be:
(1)
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 5-201. - General standards.
In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
(2)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(3)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
(4)
Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include ANY fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
b.
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(5)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
(6)
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
(7)
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
(8)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
(9)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and
(10)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. No. 2007O-12, 11-13-2007; Ord. No. 2008O-10, 8-12-2008)
Sec. 5-202. - Specific standards.
In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, which provides an additional level of protection referred to as "freeboard." Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-201(4), "Elevated Buildings."
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
(2)
Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 5-178(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 5-201(6) above.)
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 5-202(3)a.—c., above.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-135, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
ONLY if subsection 5-202(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.
(Ord. No. 2007O-12, 11-13-2007; Ord. No. 2008O-10, 8-12-2008)
Sec. 5-203. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-135 where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), OR where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 5-135, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-201(4), "Elevated Buildings."
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Sec. 5-204. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-135, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-201(4), "Elevated Buildings."
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 5-177(1)c. and (2).

Sec. 5-227. - Conditions for variances.
(a)
A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is:
(1)
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
(2)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
(3)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(b)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(c)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(d)
The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(e)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Rockmart Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in section 2-254(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 5-254(b)(2) of this article;
(15)
Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:

There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: Provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and

a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.
The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.

In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan.

(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority.

Building permit means the written document authorizing the construction of works of improvements, alterations or other construction activities concerning any movable housing, as defined in this section, within the city.
Movable housing means any house, dwelling, building or other structure (not a manufactured home as defined in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131(3)) which has been extracted from its foundation or other permanent location by means of dollies, jacks or other devices so as to be made portable, movable or otherwise subject to being transported or hauled; when in fact the structure was not constructed or designed for that purpose.
Moving permit means that written document required to authorize the moving, transportation or relocation of any movable housing either within or without the corporate limits of the city.
Sec. 5-287. - Regulations, restrictions for use of public streets.
(a)
Permit. No person shall use the streets within the corporate city limits of the city to move, transport or relocate any house, dwelling, building or other structure of a width more than 12 feet at its widest point, or a length of more than 60 feet at its longest point, or a height of 14 feet at its highest point without first obtaining a permit from the building inspector, or his designated agent (hereafter referred to as the issuer).

The terms of the permit shall be strictly adhered to by the mover; no deviation therefrom shall be permitted without the express written permission of the issuer.
(d)
Application deadline. Application for a permit must be made at least 15 days prior to the proposed moving, at which time the issuer shall notify the chief of police, who shall furnish, at the time of moving, such necessary police escort to the mover as the police chief deems necessary to ensure the safety of the public.
(e)
Sign required. A sign evidencing that a structure is to be removed or located, as the case may be, upon any real property within the city shall be placed upon the property at least 15 days prior to the proposed removal or relocation. This sign shall comport with the general size requirements of signs evidencing a proposed change of property zoning within the city.

If damage costs exceed the deposit, the mover shall be liable to the city for all additional expenses.
Sec. 5-288. - Restrictions on transportation.

(c)
Where work for which a permit is required by this Code is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining the permit, the fees specified shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this Code in the execution of the work nor from any other penalties prescribed in this article.
Sec. 5-290. - Standards for review of issuance of permit.
The building inspector of the city is charged with the authority for the enforcement of this article. As such, in determining whether to issue a moving permit, he shall use the following criteria:
(1)
No permit for movable housing shall be issued until notice of an application for a permit, to be made on forms approved by the city, has been given to the owners of all adjoining property upon which the building or structure is to be moved. Each adjoining property owner, including those adjacent to the property and across the street directly therefrom, shall be allowed to be heard before the building inspector before the granting of a permit occurs.
(2)
Whether the proposed housing can be properly brought to the level of minimum standard requirements contained in the building code of the city, and as generally required pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 8-2-1 et seq. The aforesaid provisions of state law generally deal with the construction or alteration of buildings. Those sections of this Code or state law applicable to movable housing shall be used as criteria for determining the feasibility of issuing a permit to the applicant.
(3)
Whether the structure, when complete, will have a fair market value which is not less than 80 percent of the assessed fair market value of adjoining comparable properties, for tax purposes, in the general vicinity and neighborhood within the city where this structure is to be located. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the structure's presence in the area will not diminish property values.
(4)
Whether the structure can safely and properly, using reasonable construction standards and those contained in this Code, be properly placed upon the property, constructed, repaired and maintained as a residential dwelling unit fit and safe for occupancy by the general public.
(5)
Whether the placing of a movable housing structure, together with all work or other construction to be accomplished in the vicinity of the property will create a health, safety or public hazard or nuisance within the corporate limits of the city.
(6)
Whether the applicant has, within five years before the date of the application, had a building permit revoked, failed to comply with code standards and requirements of the building inspector or otherwise been cited for significant violations of the building codes and ordinances of the city.
Sec. 5-291. - Permit not transferable; subject to denial, revocation, suspension or amendment.
(a)
A permit, once issued, may not be transferred from one person to another, or from one licensed location for the moving of a structure contemplated by this article to another location, without the express written consent of the building inspector having been first obtained.
(b)
The building inspector shall have full power and authority to deny, revoke, refuse to grant, suspend or amend, as might be needed, any moving permit to be granted under this article.
(c)
Since the criteria and establishment of this permit also requires later enforcement and compliance with this article, this permit and the accompanying building permit shall be subject to revocation for cause.
(d)
Before taking any action adverse to an applicant or permit holder, the building inspector shall conduct a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard concerning the grant, renewal, refusal or suspension of any license privileges granted under this article. Appeal of any decision of the building inspector shall be to the city council.
Sec. 5-292. - Hearing.
Upon written application within 30 days of the decision of the building inspector, any applicant or other party aggrieved by any decision pursuant to this article shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the city council. At that time the aggrieved party shall be allowed to present evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses, or present any and all documentation concerning the application or decision. Failure to make timely appeal of the decision within the time period shall cause the decision to become final and nonappealable. The hearing shall be conducted within 30 days from the date of a timely application and the final decision of the city council in this regard shall be accomplished in writing and communicated to the aggrieved party. The review before the city council shall be conducted pursuant to the criteria contained in this article for review by the building inspector, and shall be considered a de novo consideration of the decision.
