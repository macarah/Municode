ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 32-80. - Two-step review.
The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two separate steps. These are:
(1)
Review of the preliminary plat by the building inspector and county engineer.
(2)
Review of the final plat by the building inspector and county engineer and approval by county commissioners.
( Ord. of 3-1-2021(1) )
Sec. 32-81. - Review procedure.
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats:
(1)
Preliminary plat procedures.
a.
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building inspector. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in five prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the building inspector office shall contain the name, phone number, and address of the subdivider (or the subdivider's designee); and no preliminary plat shall be approved by the building inspector without full compliance with the requirements of this article. Actions by the building inspector may be appealed to the county administrator. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the subdivider or designee to the address listed on the plat not less than five days before the hearing date fixed. Appeals from a decision of the administrator shall be heard by the county commissioners, with the same notice of hearing provided. All appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action being appealed was taken.
b.
Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the building inspector. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by section 32-110(3) and additionally as deemed necessary by the building inspector. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit the plat to the building inspector prior to formal approval of the preliminary plat.
c.
The building inspector shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after formal submission, and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing his disapproval and the reasons therefor. Failure of the building inspector to act within 30 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the building inspector on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period.
d.
Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the building inspector. Also noted shall be the date on which the building inspector granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require an resubmittal of a plat plan to the building inspector for approval, unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the building inspector.
e.
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the building inspector, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(2)
Final plat procedure. Application for final approval of the subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building inspector after approval of the preliminary plat. Ten copies of the final plat are required. The building inspector shall examine the final plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, conforms to the approved preliminary plat, and whether all required improvements as set forth in Article VI hereof have been completed. Within 30 days of such final plat being submitted, the building inspector shall recommend approval or require the subdivider to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required by the final plat. Upon recommendation of final approval by the building inspector, the county commissioners shall discuss and or grant final approval of the subdivision plat. Actions of the building inspector and decisions may be appealed under the same procedure as outlined in subsection (1) of this section. If approved by the Commissioners, a plat can be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court upon meeting all requirements of Article VI of this chapter and authentication by the county commissioners. For purposes hereof, authentication shall be in the following form, to wit: Approved for recording on the ___ day of ________, 20___, by the chairperson of county commissioners.

Essentially, the digital version of the map must be of a high precision so that it can be easily converted to a GIS format.
(6)
All lots, new and existing, must be closed polygons (polylines).
(f)
Layer names, feature types, and descriptions.
(1)
BLDG (polygon): all existing building/structure footprint areas.

BM (point): all benchmark and geodetic monument locations.
(3)
BSL* (polygon): all building setback areas (see Figure B).
(4)
BUFFER* (polygon): all exclusion areas as required by ordinance(s) (see Figure C).
(5)
COMAREA* (polygon): all common areas inside the subdivision (see Figure D).
(6)
EAS* (polygon): all existing and proposed easement areas located either inside or adjacent to the subdivision (see Figure E).
(7)
ESBW ANNO - (annotation): all text describing easements, setbacks, buffers, and wetlands.
(8)
MISCANNO - (annotation): any additional (optional) plat text not included in the other required annotation layers defined in these standards:

b.
Digital data and submission standards.
(9)
PARCEL (polygon): all parcel boundary areas within the subdivision (see Figure F).
(10)
PARCELANNO - (annotation): all new PINs, lot numbers and street addresses for subdivision lots (individual or tabular).
(11)
ROW* (polygon): all existing and new road and drainage right-of-way areas, located either inside or adjacent to the subdivision (see Figure G).
(12)

(14)
SURVEY ANNO - (annotation): all survey data (bearings, distances, curve data, tie lines, etc.).
(15)
WETLAND* (polygon): all existing delineated wetland areas either inside or adjacent to the subdivision (see Figure I).
*Note: In AutoCAD, island areas such as the one created by the example right-of-way in Figure G would be created by three or more polylines. Multiple polylines do not translate to one polygon in ArcGIS. In order to create a correct polygon of the right-of-way, it is necessary to make an AutoCAD block of all the associated right-of-way polylines. Any deviation from these standards will have to have prior approval from the county/city engineer or his appointee.

Secs. 32-112—32-136. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 32-137. - Required improvements.
(a)
Subdivider provision prior to final plat approval. A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.
(b)
Water supply. When a required water system is installed, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for four minutes or 250 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be provided at distances not greater than 1,000 feet apart. The water main may be located in the right-of-way, but may not be located under the pavement. Water lines three-fourths-inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a county water system is not available, the governing authority may make an exception to this rule. The water system shall be a permitted community water system as required by the State of Georgia Safe Water Drinking Act.
An approved, signed copy from the EPD (environmental protection division) of the water system plans must be submitted prior to final plat approval. Well sites should be of sufficient size to accommodate and adequately maintain the well and storage tank provided. However, the well shall be located no closer than 50 feet to any exterior property line of the subdivision.
(c)
Sanitary sewage. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.
(d)
Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system, such as a private septic tank, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the governing authority and the county health department.
(e)
Curbs and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley-type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect, and approved by the county engineer or the local governing authority, or its designee.
(f)
Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county and the state department of transportation.
(g)
Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county engineer.
(h)
