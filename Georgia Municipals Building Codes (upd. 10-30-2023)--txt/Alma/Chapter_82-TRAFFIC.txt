Sec. 82-65. - Findings and intent.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city.
