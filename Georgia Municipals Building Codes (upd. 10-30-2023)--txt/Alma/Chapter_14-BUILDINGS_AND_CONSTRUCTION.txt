These provisions shall be incorporated into the final plans and construction drawings that are filed with the application. Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall conform to the standards and specifications of this article. The application of measures shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity.
(b)
General design principles. Practical combinations of the following principles shall be utilized, as a minimum, in planning measures to be installed for any land disturbing activity:
(1)
The land disturbing activity shall conform to existing topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential.
(2)
Land disturbing activities shall be conducted in a manner minimizing erosion.
(3)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(4)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(5)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable and provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate runoff resulting from a change in topography, vegetation and soil conditions.
(9)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations and the sloping surface of fills.
(10)
To the extent necessary, sediment runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized, and all cut and fill slopes shall be designed to retain their finished grade.
(11)
Cuts and fills and other permanent structures shall not endanger adjoining property.
(12)
Fills shall not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners or the natural floodplain.
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(c)
Standards and specifications. Plans for land disturbing activities shall contain soil erosion and sediment control plans and specifications which conform to the publication entitled Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia which is on file in the office of the city clerk. Such publication is incorporated by reference in this article.
(d)
Maintenance.
(1)
The applicant carrying out soil erosion and sedimentation control practices, whether temporary or permanent, shall at all times be the responsibility of the owner.
(2)
Permanent structures which are to be incorporated into the landscape shall remain the responsibility of the original owner until such time as the property is legally deeded to a subsequent owner who will assume responsibility for maintenance of these facilities.
(3)
Soil erosion and sediment control practices which, in the opinion of the issuing authority, might be considered hazards to life or property shall be properly fenced and posted by signs in accordance with the standards and specifications of this article.
