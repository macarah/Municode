Pursuant to 16 CFR 681.1, the purpose of this article is also to establish a process by which the town will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit report when the town has received a notice of address discrepancy.

Sec. 2-722. - Findings.
The town council has found as follows:

The town is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of town services include water, sewer, solid waste, and stormwater.
(2)
The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur.
(3)
The town limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of covered accounts.
(4)
The town determines that there is a low risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways, if any:

Use by an applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new covered account;
b.
Use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous customer's name;
c.
Use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay such customer's covered account; and

(a)
As a precondition to opening a covered account with the town, each applicant shall provide the town with personal identifying information of the customer in the form of a valid government issued identification card containing a photograph of the customer or, for customers who are not natural persons, a photograph of the customer's agent opening the account with written confirmation of being the authorized agent for the entity. The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the town's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those town personnel with the need to know.
(b)
For each customer account for which the town may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

The password shall be at least eight characters in length and shall contain letters, numbers and symbols.
Sec. 2-725. - Report of unauthorized access.
Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts is to be reported immediately to the appropriate department head and the password changed immediately.

Sec. 2-727. - Credit card payments.
(a)
In the event that credit card payments that are made over the Internet are processed through a third party service provider, such third party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments.
