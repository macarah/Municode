Sec. 74-301. - Findings and applicability.
(a)
Findings. The City of Atlanta finds that buffers adjacent to streams and wetlands are beneficial to water quality because they:
(1)
Protect, restore, and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources;
(2)
Improve surface water, urban stormwater runoff, and groundwater quality by filtering pollutants, nutrients, sediment, and other contaminants;
(3)
Reduce erosion and sedimentation;
(4)
Protect and stabilize stream banks and stream channels;
(5)
Maintain base flow of streams by aiding in groundwater recharge, and thereby protect dry weather low flows in streams;
(6)
Contribute organic matter that is a source of food, energy, and habitat for the aquatic ecosystem;
(7)
Provide tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat including but not limited to the moderation of water temperature in streams;
(8)
Provide and protect riparian wildlife habitat and wildlife migration corridors;
(9)
Offer educational and recreational opportunities; and
(10)
Protect greenspace.
Therefore, the city finds that the protection of the streams, wetlands, and the areas adjacent to them is vital to the safety, health, peace, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall apply to both public and private property within the city. This article shall be administered in its entirety by the department of watershed management unless otherwise specified herein.

Sec. 74-306. - Authorized encroachments.
The commissioner may authorize an encroachment to allow development within the buffer upon a showing by the applicant that due to site-specific conditions, the buffer required by this article would result in a hardship or extreme hardship; provided however, the grant of such encroachment shall require mitigation such that post-development conditions are at least as protective of water quality as pre-development conditions.
An authorized encroachment may be granted in accordance with the following:
(a)
Existing lots of record. In addition to the requirements set out in (c), (d) and (e) of this section, the commissioner may grant an authorized encroachment subject to the requirements of this article on existing lots of record (as defined herein):
(1)
The commissioner may grant an authorized encroachment subject to the requirements of this ordinance when literal enforcement of the required buffer would result in a hardship, and no reasonable alternative to an authorized encroachment exists; and
(2)
No authorized encroachment shall be granted to an existing lot of record that allows for development less than or equal to 50 feet from a stream measured in accordance with section 74-303 of this article unless it is a redevelopment that meets the requirements of subsection 74-306(a)(3) of this article or a single- or two-family residential development; and
(3)
No authorized encroachment shall be granted for redevelopment of an existing lot of record unless the redevelopment results in a net reduction of the buffer encroachment from the existing condition, the redevelopment is designed to minimize the degree and impact of the encroachment, and the result of redevelopment is an overall improvement of buffer's ability to provide water quality and other environmental benefits.
(b)
New lots of record. In addition to the requirements set out in (c) and (d) of this subsection, the following shall apply to authorized encroachments on new lots of record (as defined herein):
(1)
No authorized encroachment shall be granted to a new lot of record to achieve greater than the minimum total developable area for a property's zoning classification.
(2)
No authorized encroachment shall be granted to a new lot of record to achieve greater than the minimum development requirements of a commercial lot.
(3)
No authorized encroachment shall be granted to a new lot of record except in the case of an extreme hardship. An extreme hardship shall be based upon on a showing by the applicant (set out more particularly in section 74-308) that no reasonable alternative for compliance exists and denial of such authorized encroachment would result in one of the following:
(i)
non-compliance with applicable state or federal regulatory law, including, in particular, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; or
(ii)
severe and unavoidable hazard to public health or safety; or
(iii)
severe and unavoidable harm to the environment;
provided, however, neither lesser property value by comparison to properties in the vicinity, nor compliance with this or other applicable ordinances shall constitute grounds for extreme hardship.
(c)
All lots of record. The following are applicable to all authorized encroachments.
(1)
Authorized encroachments shall not be granted that reduce the buffer to a width less than the minimum standards established by O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8, 12-7-6, or federal law.
(2)
Authorized encroachments shall not be granted for a distance, location, or activity that is greater than necessary to alleviate a hardship or extreme hardship imposed by a strict application of this article.
(3)
Actions of a property owner that have created a hardship or extreme hardship shall not constitute grounds for granting an authorized encroachment.
(4)
The granting of a zoning variance shall not create a right to an exemption under section 74-305 or the grant of an authorized encroachment under section 74-306.
(5)
Authorized encroachments shall not be granted for wells, on-site sewage management systems, detention ponds, or underground stormwater detention facilities, except upon a showing by the applicant of an extreme hardship as set out in section 74-306(b)(3).
(6)
Authorized encroachments shall not be granted for impervious gaming courts.
(7)
Authorized encroachments shall be designed to maximize the area of the buffer where sheet flow discharge of stormwater occurs. The sheet flow of stormwater through the entire buffer shall be the goal of the design. However, where redirection of stormwater is necessary for drainage control, vegetated swales shall be utilized where practicable.
(d)
Mitigation. Mitigation shall be required as a condition for the grant of an authorized encroachment in order to ensure that post-development conditions are at least as protective of water quality as pre-development conditions. Mitigation shall be proposed by the applicant in accordance with guidance prepared by the department of watershed management that shall include, at a minimum, the following options:
(1)
Stormwater quality improvement measures or stormwater quantity reduction measures as specified by the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(2)
Stream or wetland restoration;
(3)
Buffer revegetation as specified in the City of Atlanta Buffer Revegetation Guidelines, which shall be maintained by the department of watershed management and available for public inspection;

(a)
Relationship to O.C.G.A. § § 12-2-8 and 12-7-6.

The City of Atlanta Stream Buffer shall overlay the state waters buffer recognized by section 74-43(c)(15) of the Atlanta City Code, and created by O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8 and 12-7-6. If an applicant applies to EPD for a state waters buffer variance under O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6, the applicant must also apply with the city for an authorized encroachment, and these applications may be considered concurrently.
(2)
No provision of this article shall be interpreted as relaxing or exempting any requirement of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8 or 12-7-6. The commissioner shall not grant an authorized encroachment to stream buffers otherwise regulated by the Environmental Protection Division, Department of Natural Resources, State of Georgia pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 absent the grant of a stream buffer variance from EPD.
(3)
Receiving a stream buffer variance from EPD from the operation of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 is not grounds for the commissioner to grant a similar authorized encroachment.
(b)
Relationship to the Metropolitan River Protection Act. No provision of this article shall be interpreted as relaxing or exempting any requirement of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453. Further, the requirements of this article are intended to fulfill the requirements of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-453, which mandate that local jurisdictions adopt regulations governing the use of all land which is in the drainage basin of any tributary flowing into the Chattahoochee River Corridor (2,000-foot Chattahoochee River Corridor), which at a minimum, include buffer areas of adequate width as determined by local governing authorities along all flowing streams in the drainage basin of any tributary, in which buffer areas there shall be no development.
(c)
Relationship to Chapter 74 Article VIII of the Atlanta City Code (Wetland Protection Regulation).
(1)
The commissioner shall not grant an authorized encroachment allowing development in a wetland under the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to § 404 of the Clean Water Act absent the grant of a United States Army Corps of Engineers permit.
(2)
No section of this article shall be interpreted as relaxing or exempting any requirements of section 74-401 et seq. of the Atlanta City Code, § 404 of the Clean Water Act, or any jurisdictional wetland disturbance permitting procedures under the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
(3)
The City of Atlanta Wetland Buffer shall overlay any buffers or other protections that may be required by federal law. If an applicant applies to the Department of the Army for a wetland disturbance permit, the applicant must also apply with the city for an authorized encroachment, and these applications may be considered concurrently. Receiving a United States Army Corps of Engineers permit is not grounds for the commissioner to grant a similar authorized encroachment.
(d)
Relationship to O.C.G.A., 12-5-570 et seq. The water supply watershed buffer is adopted, effective January 13, 2009, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-570 et seq. and GA Comp. R. & Regs. §§ 391-3-16.01 et seq.

(e)
Relationship to Chapter 74 Article II of the Atlanta City Code (Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control). Erosion and sedimentation control best management practices as set forth in Chapter 74 Article II of this Code shall be implemented to prevent the migration of any sediment into a stream, wetland, waters of the state, or buffer, if such practices are not already required by this or other ordinances.
(f)

In addition, the following requirements shall apply:
(1)
All riparian buffers shall be shown on the plat;
(2)
For any new development, the riparian buffer shall be physically delineated in accordance with City of Atlanta Buffer Revegetation Guidelines.
(g)
Conflict with other laws. No section of this ordinance shall be interpreted as relaxing or exempting any requirements of Chapter 74 Article II, Chapter 74 Article VI, or Chapter 158 Article II of the Atlanta City Code. In the event of a conflict between or among any provisions of this article, or any other laws, regulations, or policies, the requirements that are most protective of water quality shall apply. Violation of this article shall not preclude the prosecution of a violation of other sections of this Code which may apply.
(h)
Liability. Neither the issuance of a building permit nor compliance with this article shall relieve any person from civil liability to any person or property otherwise imposed by law, or constitute the assumption of such liability.

No structure or impervious surface shall be horizontally expanded to occupy greater land area inside the buffer; altered in a manner that changes the quantity, velocity, or quality of stormwater runoff; or moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the buffer without an authorized encroachment. Any replacement or reconstruction activity within the buffer shall occur within the original footprint or shall require compliance with the provisions of this article. No authorized encroachment is required by this article for repairs, restoration, and renovation performed upon existing structures and impervious surfaces which are considered to be existing nonconforming as of the effective date of this article.
(Ord. No. 2001-100, § 3, 12-11-01; Ord. No. 2002-21, § 3, 3-26-02; Ord. No. 2010-13(10-O-0058), § 16, 4-27-10)
Sec. 74-316. - Buffer management and maintenance.
(a)
In the event that development is conducted within 25 feet of any buffer, the buffer shall be physically protected by placing currently approved tree protection fencing at the buffer boundary or the limits of construction, whichever is more protective of the buffer. If an authorized encroachment has been granted, the limits of the encroachment shall be similarly delineated.
(b)
The owner of the property containing a buffer as defined herein shall be responsible for maintenance of the buffer and shall inspect the buffer periodically for evidence of degradation in regard to the purposes listed in section 74-301 and compliance with all other provisions of this article.
