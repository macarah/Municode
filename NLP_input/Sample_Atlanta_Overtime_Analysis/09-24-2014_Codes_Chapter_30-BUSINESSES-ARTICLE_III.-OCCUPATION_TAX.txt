Sec. 30-86. - Appeal of decisions of the chief financial officer; claims for refunds.
(a)
Any decision of the chief financial officer under this article, including without limitation, such decisions as to entitlement to exemptions, profitability classifications, methods of accounting, the imposition of penalties and interest, and the amount of tax due, may be appealed, in writing by any taxpayer. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the business tax division and no special form is required except that the taxpayer set forth sufficient information for the determination of the appeal. The taxpayer shall be responsible to set forth the information, which the taxpayer considers pertinent to the appeal and the chief financial officer may consider the appeal based only on the information submitted by the taxpayer. The chief financial officer shall act on such appeals only when submitted by the taxpayer, an attorney acting directly on the behalf of a taxpayer or from a person who presents a signed and notarized power of attorney that they are authorized to represent the taxpayer.
(i)
The filing of an appeal as to the amount of tax due shall not act to relieve the taxpayer of the requirement to pay the amount of tax levied or to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest. The filing of an appeal of the amount of tax calculated to be due follows a separate procedure from a claim for refund and taxpayers are hereby put on notice that the filing of an appeal of the determination of the amount of tax due is not a claim for refund and does not preserve any rights of the taxpayer with respect the time limits within which refunds must be claimed under state law.
(ii)
The chief financial officer shall make a written determination on all appeals, except for claims for refunds, within six months of its filing. Other than a refund claim, any appeal, not acted on within six months is deemed denied.
(iii)
An appeal of a decision of the chief financial officer as to decisions made under this section shall be to the Superior Court of Fulton County by writ of certiorari wherein the errors complained of are plainly and distinctly set forth.
(iv)
Any appeal concerning the issuance of executions shall be governed in the manner set forth by state law.
(b)
Any claim for refund of any tax provided for in this article shall be subject to the provisions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380 as it exists now or as it may be amended.
(i)
Any claim for refund of any tax provided for in this article shall be in writing and shall be addressed, by the taxpayer, to the chief financial officer, who is herein designated by the city council to accept claims for refunds. The claim shall identify the taxpayer, specify the business location, the tax years for which refunds are claimed and the dates of payment for which the refund is claimed. The claim shall also include a summary statement of the grounds on which the taxpayer relies and shall specify the tax years and dates of payments to which such grounds apply. In the event that the taxpayer desires a conference or hearing before the chief financial officer in connection with any claim for refund, the taxpayer shall so specify in writing at the time of filing the claim. The chief financial officer shall grant a conference at a time of his/her convenience except in those cases where the city council must hear the claim.
(ii)
The date of filing shall be the date that the claim for refund is received by the chief financial officer. In any case where the chief financial officer does not make a refund for any or all of the amount claimed, or cause the refund claim to appear on the agenda of the committee with purview over the department of finance, within one year of the date that the claim is received, the taxpayer may consider that the claim is denied. No claim shall be deemed approved by the failure of the chief financial officer to make a decision on the claim or to failure of the claim to appear on the agenda of the committee with purview over the department of finance. The chief financial officer and the taxpayer may agree in writing to extend the one year period for processing of the claim and such action shall stay the presumption of denial until the written agreement expires.
(iii)
In cases where there is an obvious clerical error, or the amount to be refunded is $5,000.00 or less the chief financial officer is authorized to approve any refund and may pay the refund without further authorization of the city council.
(iv)
In cases where there is no obvious clerical error or the amount to be refunded exceeds $5,000.00, the governing authority shall approve or disapprove the claim through a resolution which shall also be considered at least once at a meeting of the committee with purview over the department of finance, prior to a final vote. In such cases where the taxpayer has requested a hearing before the governing authority, such hearing shall take place at said committee meeting.
(c)
Further proceedings concerning the denial of refund claims shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380 as it may be from time to time amended.

Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices or citations issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the city shall direct the notices or citations to the address listed with the State Bar of Georgia and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service.

DIVISION 2. - RETAIL INCENTIVE TAX-EXEMPT ZONES

Sec. 30-101. - Definitions.

Dedicated pedestrian entrance means a pedestrian entrance to a retail business location which opens on a city street and which provides access to only that business location.
Interior retail means a retail business whose primary retail sales operation is not accessed through a dedicated pedestrian entrance.

Mixed-use residential and commercial urban enterprise zone means a zone of the city created pursuant to section 146-51(g)(4) of this Code.

(Ord. No. 1997-48, § 2, 8-25-97)
Sec. 30-102. - Purpose and scope of exemption.
It has been found by the bureau of planning that available commercial space in certain areas within the city is currently not utilized to their full potential. The lack of significant levels of retail activity in these areas contributes to overall economic decline in the city. While many of the commercial enterprise zone programs have stimulated some commercial development, this type of incentive is not usually passed along to the retail tenant. Many retailers who are presently located in high cost commercial space in the downtown area are often unable to afford the additional staff to expand the hours of the business and thus contribute to the development of a 24-hour street life in the downtown area. Many retailers who desire to locate in the downtown area are often unable to afford the available space. While economic development growth trends suggest strong markets in the surrounding suburbs, the urban and tourism market trends also suggest that the downtown area and other areas in the city will support clean, safe and attractive retail centers. The need for such retail centers must be ensured through public incentives which will assist this growth.
The redevelopment or growth of certain areas of the city will be increased or sustained by the promotion of retail or mixed-use including retail and the availability of increased retail shopping opportunities will provide additional amenities to encourage and support intown or downtown residential housing. The state recognizes that municipalities desire to encourage or support such goals and in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-10(f) provides specific authority allowing local governments to provide an exemption from business or occupation taxes for the purpose of developing, attracting, encouraging or maintaining selected types of businesses. In order to encourage persons providing retail shopping opportunities to locate in those areas of the city presently underserved by retail uses or mixed-use including retail, an exemption from the city business or occupation tax is herein provided as permitted by state law.
The following exemption from the business tax levied in this article, division 1 is for the purpose of promoting development of retail or mixed-use including retail in certain areas of the city and is not for regulatory purposes. The exemption only applies to those businesses and occupations that are taxed pursuant to sections 30-51—30-85 by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinance and no other effect on any other code section is intended.

DIVISION 3. - EXEMPTION AVAILABLE FOR RESTAURANTS WHERE SMOKING IS ENTIRELY PROHIBITED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS

Sec. 30-200. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in section 30-51, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning or where defined herein:
Licensed premises means, for the purposes of this article, the entire enclosed or unenclosed physical premises where a restaurant operates under its business license including service areas or offices which are not accessible to customers.

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-201. - Purpose and scope of exemption.
It has been found by the city council that the availability of smoke-free restaurants within the city should be encouraged. There is large body of scientific research which documents the deleterious effects on the health of non-smokers who are in close proximity to smoke from cigarettes and other tobacco products. The council believes that measures which increase the number of smoke-free restaurants will offer health benefits to its citizens and visitors and not cause any appreciable amount of negative economic consequences to the city or its businesses. The council wishes to encourage restaurants to make smoke-free dining available to citizens and is therefore offering an exemption from a portion of the business and occupation tax to those restaurants which meet the criteria of this division for the purpose of demonstrating the economic viability of smoke-free restaurants.
The State of Georgia recognizes that municipalities desire to encourage or support such goals and in section 48-13-10(f) of the Official Code of Georgia provides specific authority allowing local governments to provide an exemption from business or occupation taxes for the purpose of developing, attracting, encouraging or maintaining selected types of businesses. In order to encourage restaurants to provide smoke free dining opportunities in those areas of the city where such opportunities are not presently available or are underserved by smoke-free restaurants, an exemption from the city business or occupation tax is herein provided as permitted by state law.
The following exemption from the business tax levied in this article III, division 1 is for the purpose of promoting development of smoke-free restaurants and is not for regulatory purposes. The exemption only applies to those businesses and occupations that are taxed pursuant to section 30-51 through 30-85 by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinance and no other effect on any other code section is intended.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)

Sec. 30-203. - Administration.

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-204. - Exemption provided.
In accordance with state law, an exemption is hereby provided from the business tax levied by section 30-51 through 30-85 for those restaurants eligible under the terms set forth in this division. Said exemption is to apply only to specific restaurant locations qualified for an exemption under this division and no exemption is provided for any other business location operated by the same person, unless said location separately qualifies under the terms of this division.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-205. - Criteria for eligibility.

PERSONS WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS FACILITY IS IN VIOLATION MAY REPORT THE VIOLATION TO THE CITY OF ATLANTA BUREAU OF BUILDINGS." By administrative rule, the bureau of buildings may at its discretion add other language to promote enforcement efforts and may specify the size and arrangement of the text on this or any other required sign.

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-206. - Application and approval required.
(a)
Any restaurant desiring an exemption under this division must make application to the business tax division on a form provided by the department of finance. The exemption must be approved in writing before any restaurant seeking an exemption under this division may apply the exemption to its present year tax liability. Any person who operates a qualifying restaurant in full compliance with this article and who properly registers and is approved and certified as qualifying for exemption from business taxes for that restaurant for the current tax year prior to the due date for business taxes may apply the exemption to their tax liability for the current tax year. All persons operating any restaurant location that has applied for but has not received approval for exemption prior to the due date for business taxes for the current tax year may not apply an exemption to their tax liability. The exemption shall be prorated from the date of application in the first year of qualification.
(b)
Any person desiring to qualify a particular restaurant location, which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, for an exemption pursuant to this division must receive written confirmation from the city police department that the location is designated as a restaurant as defined herein and must make application to and receive approval from the business tax division.
(c)
Any person desiring to qualify a particular restaurant location for the exemption made available by this division and who is required by any other applicable section of the City Code to file any business tax return, must timely file such other business tax returns in order to qualify for the exemption available pursuant to this division. Failure to file a business tax return when required to do so by any other applicable section of the City Code shall be grounds for denial of the exemption provided in this division.
(d)
Any person, who applies for an exemption for a location which fails to qualify under the term of this division, shall be responsible for the full payment of all business taxes for that location in addition to any penalties and interest as provided elsewhere in this article.
(e)
Each person who receives an exemption shall be provided with a list of the specific signage requirements which may be set forth by the administrative rules of the bureau of buildings.

Sec. 30-207. - Exemption rate structure.

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-210. - Notice of non-compliance sent to owner for failure to enforce designated non-smoking areas.
Because the granting of an exemption under this section is a privilege which is subject to abuse solely for economic gain, the city recognizes that there must be a mechanism to monitor compliance by those restaurants that have chosen to apply for tax exemptions under the terms of this division. The city believes that those who receive the exemption have a duty to request compliance from its patrons, and for the failure of restaurants granted exemption to comply with the non smoking designations required by this division will result in a notice of non-compliance letter being issued to the owner by the bureau of buildings and being kept on file by the bureau of treasury, licensing and employee benefits. The notice of violation is an administrative notice and is not an ordinance violation. The receipt of a notice of non-compliance letter shall not require appearance in municipal court.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
