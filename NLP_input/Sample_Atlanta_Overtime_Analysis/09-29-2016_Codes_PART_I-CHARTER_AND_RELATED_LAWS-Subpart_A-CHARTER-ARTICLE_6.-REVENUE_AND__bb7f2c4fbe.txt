For the purpose of raising revenue for the support and maintenance of city government and for other corporate purposes, the governing body shall have full power and authority to provide by ordinance for the assessment, levy, and collection of an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property, which, under the laws of this state, is subject to taxation within the corporate limits of the city. For the purpose of raising revenue for the payment of interest and principal on the bonded indebtedness of the city, the governing body shall have full power and authority to provide by ordinance for the assessment, levy, and collection of an annual ad valorem tax on all real and personal property, which, under the laws of this state, is subject to taxation within the corporate limits of the city, and to provide such an amount in millage as may be necessary to meet and pay all such obligations.
(b)
For the purpose of raising revenue for permanent improvements in the parks of the city, and for facility maintenance, repair, replenishment, enhancement, and the purchase of equipment for such parks, the governing body shall have full power and authority to provide by ordinance for the assessment, levy, and collection of an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property, which, under the laws of this state, is subject to taxation within the corporate limits of the city, in the amount of one-half mill on each dollar of assessed valuation thereon; such tax, when collected shall be used as follows: 90 percent exclusively for permanent improvements to the zoo, golf courses, recreational, and other park facilities of the city, and ten percent for park facility maintenance, repair, replenishment, enhancement, and the purchase of equipment. In the event that any part of the tax so collected cannot be used in any one year, it may be invested in short-term securities until such time as the use of said funds becomes necessary or possible. The tax provided for herein shall be in addition to all other taxes authorized by this Charter.
(c)
The tax authorized by subsection (b) shall be used only as provided herein. Any sums not used in any one year for such purposes shall be converted into a trust fund to be held and expended for such purposes in future years. Half of the half-mill tax may, at the discretion of the council, be used for the purpose of constructing a stadium and related facilities in the city or for the purpose of paying in whole or in part the obligation assumed by the city by contract now or hereafter entered into with any authority now in existence or hereafter created which has agreed to construct a stadium and related facilities in the city.
(d)
No enumeration of any right, power, or authority provided in this Charter shall be construed as limiting or abolishing any right, power, or privilege herein set forth.

Resident lots shall not be subdivided or assessed separately except where they have two or more houses used or intended for use as separate tenements built upon them, in which case a sanitary assessment maybe levied against the lot for each house situated thereon.
(g)
The governing body of the city, in addition to being authorized to assess, levy, and impose taxes for sanitary purposes, as set forth hereinabove in subsection (f), shall be authorized to charge fees for the collection, removal or disposal, or both, of all solid waste except body wastes, ashes, street cleanings, dead animals, abandoned automobiles, and market and industrial wastes, such fees to be charged against the owners or, when not owner-occupied, against the occupants, tenants, or lessees of the premises from which the fee is collected, and from which such waste is removed or disposed of, or both, from which collection and removal services are made available. The amount of such fees may depend upon the amount, weight, or volume of collections and whether collected from residential, commercial, industrial, or other property.
(h)
All public property exempt from taxation by the city by law shall likewise be exempt from all assessments, levies, and taxes specified under subsection (f) above. All fees for services charged against any such property as specified in subsection (g) above shall be due and payable when billed in due course by the city.

Section 6-315. - Fund balance policy.
The City will report fund balance amounts consistent with the appropriate Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB") guidance. This policy and the procedures promulgated under it supersede all previous regulations regarding the City's fund balance and reserve policies.
(a)
Fund balance terms. The following fund balance definitions will be recognized:
Fund equity. A fund's equity is generally the difference between its assets and its liabilities. For governmental funds, fund equity is also known as fund balance.
Fund balance. An accounting distinction is made between the portions of fund equity that are spendable and nonspendable. These are broken up into five categories:
(1)
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that are not in a spendable form or are required to be maintained intact. Examples are inventory or long term advances to or from other funds.
(2)
Restricted fund balance includes amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by external resource providers either constitutionally or through enabling legislation. Examples include grants and bond covenants.
(3)
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by the government taking the same formal action that imposed the constraint originally.
(4)
Assigned fund balance comprises amounts intended to be used by the government for specific purposes. Intent can be expressed by the governing body or by an official or body to which the governing body delegates the authority. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance represents the amount that is not restricted or committed. This indicates that resources in other governmental funds are, at a minimum, intended to be used for the purpose of that fund. Example includes fund balance used to balance the budget.
(5)
Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification of the general fund and includes all amounts not contained in other classifications. Unassigned amounts are technically available for any purpose. The general fund is the only fund that may have a positive balance in this category.
Unrestricted fund balance. The total of committed fund balance, assigned fund balance, and unassigned fund balance, which includes only resources without a constraint on spending or for which the constraint on spending is imposed by the government itself.
(b)
Prioritization of fund balance use.
(1)
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted (committed, assigned, or unassigned) amounts are available, the City shall consider restricted amounts to have been reduced first.
(2)
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of the unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used, the City shall first reduce committed amounts, followed by assigned amounts and then unassigned amounts.
(3)
Prior to the fund balance being encumbered for any expenditure in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, three and one-half (3.5) percent of the general fund budget at the beginning of each fiscal year shall be appropriated to ensure adequate annual funding for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement of public infrastructure.
(c)
Authority to commit or assign. Commitments or assignments will only be used for specific purposes. Committed balances or assigned balances will only be established pursuant to a formal action by the City Council, upon recommendation from the Chief Financial Officer. Such commitments or assignments cannot exceed the available fund balance in any particular fund.
(d)
Minimum unrestricted fund balance in the General Fund.
(1)
The City will maintain a minimum unrestricted fund balance ranging from no less than 15 percent to 20 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers.
(2)
At any time that the City's unrestricted fund balance is within the range of 15 percent to 20 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may authorize additional transfers to fund balance or any deficit fund at its discretion, up to a maximum of five percent per year of the subsequent year's budgeted revenues, in preparation for adoption of the upcoming years' budget.
(e)
Replenishing deficiencies in the General Fund. When the unrestricted fund balance falls below the minimum 15 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures and outgoing transfers, the City will replenish shortages/deficiencies within the following time periods and, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may authorize additional transfers to the fund balance at its discretion, up to a maximum of five percent per year of the subsequent year's budgeted revenues, in preparation for adoption of the upcoming years' budget. Sufficient transfers shall be budgeted to restore/replenish deficits within the timelines outlined below:
(i)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance between 12.5 percent and 15 percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed one year;
(ii)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance between ten percent and 12.5 percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed three years;
(iii)
Deficiency resulting in a minimum unrestricted fund balance of less than ten percent shall be replenished over a period not to exceed five years.
(f)
Surplus fund balance. Should the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund exceed the maximum of 20 percent, upon recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Council may consider such surplus fund balance as available to reduce deficit balances in other funds and for one-time expenditures that are nonrecurring in nature. At least 50 percent of surplus fund balance must be used to reduce any deficit fund balance prior to allocation for any one-time expenditures. All such expenditures are subject to approval via regular council action.
(g)
Financial reporting. An annual reporting of fund balances as classified in accordance with GASB 54 shall be as reported in the annual Audited Financial Statements of the City of Atlanta.
(Ord. No. 2012-26(12-O-0501), § 3, 6-13-12; Ord. No. 2015-07(14-O-1513), § 1, 2-26-15 )
