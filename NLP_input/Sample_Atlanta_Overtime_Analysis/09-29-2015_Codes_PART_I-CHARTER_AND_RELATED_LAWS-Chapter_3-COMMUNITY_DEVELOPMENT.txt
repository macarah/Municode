Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for four years, including the appointed board members who serve at the pleasure of the city governing body.
(b)
The initial board members to be elected as provided above shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the governing body of the municipality shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Fulton or DeKalb counties, or both, as hereinafter provided.

If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice thereof shall be given to said electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Fulton County or DeKalb County, or both, on four dates, at least 45 days, 31 days, 17 days, and ten days, respectively, prior to such election.

Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities which are provided to the City of Atlanta as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Fulton County or DeKalb County, or both, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Fulton County, DeKalb County, or the City of Atlanta, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Fulton County, DeKalb County, or City of Atlanta ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Fulton County or DeKalb County, or both, to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing body or bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
(d)
In accordance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-71-7, each property paying taxes, fees, or assessments levied by the board for any public facility as set forth in section 3-37 of this article, shall receive a credit equal to the present value of all such taxes, fees, and assessments toward any impact fee as may be levied by the City of Atlanta against said property for system improvements, as defined under O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 71 (O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.), known as the "Georgia Development Impact Fee Act," which are in the same category as said public facility.

(1991 Ga. Laws, page 3653, § 8)
Sec. 3-44. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant hereto shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of the City of Atlanta. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of the City of Atlanta to provide services or facilities within the district; and the City of Atlanta shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include, but not be limited to, the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

(2)
The written consent to the dissolution of the community improvement district by:
a.
A majority of the owners of real property within the district who are subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district;
b.
The owners of real property constituting at least 75 percent by value of all real property within the district who are to be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. For this purpose, value shall be determined by the most recently approved county ad valorem tax digest; and
(3)
The written consent provided for above shall be submitted to the Fulton or DeKalb County tax commissioner, as applicable, who shall certify whether paragraph (2) of this subsection has been satisfied with respect to each proposed district dissolution.
(b)
At the official caucus of electors at which board members are to be elected in the sixth year following creation of the district, and every sixth year thereafter, the question shall be put to the electors present to dissolve the community improvement district. Upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the electors present and voting, who shall represent at least 75 percent of the votes cast on the basis of value, the board shall send a ballot to each owner of property subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board for a vote on the dissolution. Upon receipt of ballots consenting to the dissolution from a majority of the property owners, who shall represent at least 75 percent of the assessed value of said properties, the board shall request dissolution by the city governing authority and shall forward said ballots to the Fulton or DeKalb County tax commissioner for certification.
(c)
In the event that successful action is taken pursuant to this section to dissolve the district, the dissolution shall become effective at such time as all debt obligations of the district have been satisfied.

(d)
Upon a successful dissolution action, all noncash assets of the district other than public facilities or land or easements to be used for such public facilities, as described in section 3-37 of this article, shall be reduced to cash and, along with all other cash on hand, shall be applied to the repayment of any or all debt obligations of the district. Any cash remaining after all outstanding obligations are satisfied shall be refunded to each property owner in direct proportion to the total amount in taxes, fees, or assessments paid by the property relative to the total revenues paid by all properties in the district.
(e)
When a dissolution becomes effective, the city governing authority shall take title to all public facilities or land or easements to be used for such public facilities previously in the ownership of the district and all taxes, fees, and assessments of the district shall cease to be levied and collected.
(f)
A district may be reactivated in the same manner as an original activation.
