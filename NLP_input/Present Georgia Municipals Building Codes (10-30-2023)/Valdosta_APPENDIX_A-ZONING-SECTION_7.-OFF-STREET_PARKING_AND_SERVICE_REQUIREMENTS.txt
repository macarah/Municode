7-3.2. Inspection. At least six months after a final certificate of occupancy is issued, an inspection will be made by the City Engineer or designee. If findings indicate that the unpaved spaces are in good condition or are infrequently used, such unpaved spaces may remained unpaved. If findings show that the spaces receive as much use as the paved spaces, or have deteriorated, such unpaved spaces shall be paved within 90 days of written notice to the owner of the property. If paving is deemed necessary by the City Engineer, the property owner may be required to expand the stormwater management facilities (as provided in Section 7-3.1.2).
7-4. - Separation from Walkways, Sidewalks, Property Lines and Streets.
All off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, property lines, and streets by concrete curbing.
