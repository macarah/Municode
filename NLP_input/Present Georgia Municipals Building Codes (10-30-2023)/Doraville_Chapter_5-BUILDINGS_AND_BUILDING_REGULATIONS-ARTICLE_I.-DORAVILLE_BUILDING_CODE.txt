(i)
Flood hazard areas. The building official shall not grant modifications to any provision required in flood hazard areas as established by section 1612.3 of the International Building Code, and/or section R322 of the International Residential Code, unless a determination has been made that:
(1)
A showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site render the elevation standards of sections 1612 or R322, as applicable, inappropriate.
(2)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable.
(3)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public response, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
(4)
A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard.
(5)
Submission to the applicant of written notice specifying the difference between the design flood elevation and the elevation of which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(f)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six (6) months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the time the work is commenced. One (1) extension of time, for a period not more than sixty (60) days, may be allowed for a valid permit. The extension shall be requested in writing, with justifiable cause demonstrated, and is subject to the approval of the Building Official. Permits, nonetheless, become invalid after two (2) years. For invalid permits, work may resume only through issuance of a new permit, which will be subject to all fees required for such issuance at the time the application for the new permit is requested.
In the event of a project of significant scale, that is anticipated to take longer than two (2) years, an exception can be granted by the City Manager prior to the issuance of the permit per written request by the permit applicant.
(2)
