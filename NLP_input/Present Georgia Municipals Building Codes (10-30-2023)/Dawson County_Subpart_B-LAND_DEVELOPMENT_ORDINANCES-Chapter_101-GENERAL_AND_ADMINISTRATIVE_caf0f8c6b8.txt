Except as provided in subsection (1)b of this section, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article.
b.
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this article for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the most recently adopted capital improvements element is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise be paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding.

c.
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding the most recently adopted capital improvements element.
(2)
Granting of credits.

Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that:
1.
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the most recently adopted capital improvements element;
2.
The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding as shown in the capital improvements element; and

The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction dedication or transfer.
b.
The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 101-66.
(3)
Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
a.
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
b.
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
c.
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the county would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
d.
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution from which present value may be calculated.
e.
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond, less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(4)
Credits: application.
a.
Credits shall be giver only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.

d.
Credit denials by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with section 101-68, administrative appeals.
(5)
Credits; abandoned building permits.
