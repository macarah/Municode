Sec. 26-22. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The mayor and council find:
(1)
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
(2)
Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer.
(b)
Accordingly, the mayor and council find and declare that the purposes of this article are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and public and private places of employment;
(2)
To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and
(3)
To recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(c)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(d)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
(1)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 10, 2020, the applicant may choose either: a. Runoff reduction; or b. Water quality.
(2)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 10, 2020, the applicant shall choose: a. Runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent a. runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the Practicability Policy; then b. water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
(3)
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 26-225, the City of Berkeley Lake may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(e)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:

Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
(g)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(h)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(i)
[Temperature control used for stream protection.] Trout stream protection shall be provided by controlling temperature for receiving waters with trout stream designation. In streams designated as primary trout waters by the wildlife resources division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures.
