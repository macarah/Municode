Footnotes:
--- (12) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 87, adopted January 11, 2006, amended chapter 11 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former chapter 11, §§ 11-1.1—11-6.6, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the original codification of the Unified Development Code; Amd. of 9-25-2003 and Amd. of 2-2-2004.

ARTICLE I. - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS PRIOR TO UDC VERSION 5

11-1.1. - Purpose and intent.
Residential districts existent prior to September 25, 2003, are to comply with permitted uses and performance standards as specified in this article.
(Amd. of 1-3-2013)
11-1.2. - Permitted and conditional uses.
As provided in Table 11.1(a); and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district:
(a)
A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours.
(Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-7-2017(2))
11-1.3. - Performance standards.
As provided in Table 11.2(a).
(Amd. of 1-3-2013)
11-1.4. - Design standards.
As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE II. - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (RES1)

11-2.1. - Purpose and intent.
Res1 districts are intended to provide for subdivisions and neighborhoods consisting of detached single family dwellings surrounded by yards that provide a desirable and healthy environment. Res1 districts provide for detached manufactured/mobile homes and site built single family detached dwellings on individual lots. Res1 districts are generally served by public water supply, and public sanitary sewer is generally not available. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 2-7-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014)
11-2.2. - Permitted and conditional uses.
As provided in Table 11.1(b); and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district:
(a)
A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by Chapter 16.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-7-2017(2))
11-2.3. - Performance standards.
As provided in Table 11.2(b).
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013)
11-2.4. - Design standards.
As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
11-2.5. - Incentives for large lots.
To encourage the development of large lots in the Res1 zoning district, any requirement to connect to sewer found elsewhere in this Code shall be waived for both major and minor subdivisions with a minimum lot size of one acre or larger. A conditional use permit shall be required for a large lot subdivision not connected to sewer.
(Amd. of 7-8-2021)
ARTICLE III. - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (RES2)

11-3.1. - Purpose and intent.
Res2 districts are intended to provide for subdivisions and neighborhoods consisting of detached single family dwellings surrounded by yards that provide a desirable and healthy environment. Res2 districts are generally served by public water supply, and public sanitary sewer is generally not available. Because Res2 districts are generally served by individual septic tanks, maximum density is based on the health requirement that lots must be large enough to accommodate a septic tank drain field and replacement drain field area. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014)
11-3.2. - Permitted and conditional uses.
As provided in Table 11.1(b); and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district:
(a)
A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 12-13-2007; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-7-2017(2))
11-3.3. - Performance standards.
As provided in Table 11.2(b).
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013)
11-3.4. - Design standards.
As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE IV. - SINGLE FAMILY COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (CR2)

11-4.1. - Purpose and intent.
CR2 districts are intended to provide for subdivisions and neighborhoods consisting of detached single family dwellings surrounded by yards that provide a desirable and healthy environment. The CR2 district is intended for larger-scale subdivisions built to higher than minimum standards allowing for variability in lot sizes to encourage variation in design to enhance neighborhood character. Development within this district must be served by public water and public sewer or an existing private sewage treatment plant with sufficient capacity. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Amd. of 4-2-2015; Amd. of 12-3-2015)
11-4.2. - Permitted and conditional uses.
As provided in Table 11.1(b); and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district:

As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE V. - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (RES3)

11-5.1. - Purpose and intent.
Res3 districts are intended to provide for subdivisions and neighborhoods consisting of detached single family dwellings surrounded by yards that provide a desirable and healthy environment. The Res3 district is intended for larger-scale subdivisions built to higher than minimum standards. Open space should be provided for throughout the development and should be accessible and available for recreational use by residents. Since a higher density is permitted, Res3 districts must be served by public water and Public Sewer or an Existing Private Sewage Treatment Plant with Sufficient Capacity. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014; Amd. of 4-2-2015; Amd. of 12-3-2015)

As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE VI. - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (RES4)

11-6.1. - Purpose and intent.
The Res4 district is solely intended to provide for age-restricted housing in which at least one person 55 years or older inhabits at least 90 percent of occupied units within a given development, with all applicable verification requirements to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in UDC section 16-4.8(c) otherwise receiving compliance. The Res4 district is to be composed of single family, primarily detached dwellings, situated on smaller lots and with buildings located closely together; attached duplex and quadraplex units may also be permitted. To compensate for reduced lot sizes and setbacks, greater open space is required. Open space should be provided for throughout the development and should be accessible and available for recreational use by residents. Public water and sanitary sewer are required for developments within Res4 districts. Res4 districts shall connect to public sewer or an existing private sewage treatment plant with sufficient capacity. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014; Amd. of 4-2-2015; Amd. of 6-1-2017(2))

As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE VII. - MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (RES6)

11-7.1. - Purpose and intent.
The Res6 district is intended to provide for single family attached dwellings that allow options to increase housing variety and opportunities. In addition, Res6 districts may allow institutional type residences and other conditional institutional uses, but not to such an extent as to sacrifice the overall residential image and character. Open space should be provided for throughout the development and shall be accessible and available for recreational use by residents. Public water and sanitary sewer are required for developments within Res6 districts. Res6 districts shall connect to Public Sewer or an Existing Private Sewage Treatment Plant with Sufficient Capacity. The overall density of Res6 developments is four units per acre and therefore allows for fee simple townhouses and condominiums. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Amd. of 11-15-2004; Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014; Amd. of 4-2-2015; Amd. of 9-7-2017(2); Amd. of 6-3-2021)

As provided in article IX, section 11-9.3
(Amd. of 7-5-2018)
ARTICLE VIII. - MANUFACTURED HOME PARK DISTRICT (MHP)

11-8.1. - Purpose and intent.
MHP districts are intended to provide for affordable housing developments consisting of detached manufactured/mobile homes surrounded by minimal yards. The manufactured/mobile home park district is intended to provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured/mobile homes, owned or rented by tenants, within a planned residential community. A manufactured/mobile home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual home spaces for manufactured/mobile homes are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home space, manufactured/mobile home parks are built at densities greater than those for other detached dwellings. Service facilities such as laundry and leasing office are permitted uses in MHP districts. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 2-7-2013; Amd. of 9-4-2014; Amd. of 4-2-2015)
11-8.2. - Permitted and conditional uses.
As provided in Table 11.1(b); and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district:
(a)
A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 4-2-2015; Amd. of 9-7-2017(2))
11-8.3. - Performance standards.
As provided in Table 11.2(b).
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 4-2-2015)
11-8.4. - Site plan review and approval required.
No manufactured/mobile home park shall be developed until and unless a site plan shall have been approved by the director and director of engineering.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 1-3-2013; Amd. of 2-7-2013; Amd. of 4-2-2015)
11-8.5. - General development requirements.
In addition to the performance standards specified in Table 11.2(b), development within the MHP district shall meet the following requirements:
(a)
Site frontage and minimum width. Properties containing manufactured/mobile home parks shall have a minimum of 200 feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 200 feet throughout the entire depth of the developed portion of the property.
(b)
Perimeter buffer or landscaping. A minimum 20-foot wide buffer, where natural vegetation exists, or where no natural vegetation exists, a landscape strip with evergreen trees and a solid wooden fence of six feet in height shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of the development, except for approved access crossings.

  * For any establishment conducting around the clock business hours, a conditional use permit is required.
Notes:
Table 11.1(a)
(1)
In cases where a use is proposed but is not listed in this table, the director shall make an administrative determination as to whether or not the use is permitted in the zoning district or districts in question. The director will compare the proposed use to substantially similar uses to determine if the proposed use will be considered a prohibited, permitted, or conditional use. In making such determinations, the director shall consult the purpose and intent statements of the zoning district or districts in question, in addition to comparing the use in question to uses specifically listed in this table.
(2)
Guidelines for conservation subdivisions are found in chapter 19, conservation subdivisions.
(3)
All accessory uses shall be identified in the conditional use permit application and on the associated site plan. Accessory uses proposed to be added after the initial conditional use permit approval shall require a new conditional use permit.
(4)
In addition to receiving county approval, all applicable state and federal approvals must be obtained.
(5)
In the R3 zoning district, major and minor subdivisions for single family detached dwellings require a 6,000 square feet lot and have a maximum density of four units per acre.
(6)
Regulations for home businesses are found in chapter 16, article 3.
(7)
Places of worship for which a CUP, rezoning or development permit application is being processed, that have been approved but not constructed, that are under construction, or that have received a certificate of occupancy prior to February 2, 2017, are exempt from the size cap. In addition, property immediately adjacent to the property on which a place of worship that is exempt pursuant to this note is located, that is purchased after February 2, 2017, is also exempt from the size cap. For properties exempted from the size cap pursuant to this note, the requirements for places of worship 10,000 square feet or less in aggregate size (either conditional use permit (C) or not permitted (X)) shall apply for each zoning district. For purposes of this chart, "aggregate size" shall mean total square footage of all structures on the property on which the place of worship is located.

ARTICLE IX. - SITE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, EXCLUDING MHP DISTRICT

11-9.1. - Purpose and intent.
Residential design regulations are intended to improve aesthetic appearance and enhance community character. Mindful consideration of attractive and quality residential design is essential to implement policy goals identified in the county's comprehensive plan that focus upon the creation and maintenance of quality building and site design standards. The objective of this article is to bolster community identity through the establishment of requirements that promote distinctive materials and craftsmanship in residential building.
Community character areas identified within the comprehensive plan seek to distinguish neighborhoods within given vicinities through the promotion of identifiable characteristics related to house design, lot requirements and subdivision guidelines. A strategic approach to achieving quality design is through the incororation of regulations pertaining to elements such as building details, siting, circulation and landscaping as well as the location of amenities. These types of measures shall accommodate growth while ensuring community character is prioritized, which ultimately supports the qualityof life aspiration that has been acknowledged as a key component of the county's vision statement communicated in the comprehensive plan.

(d)
Foundation walls. Exposed foundation walls must be faced in brick, stone, or manufactured stone to the level of the first finished floor when there is a basement or at least 18 inches above grade for the entire perimeter wall when the building has a slab on grade.
(e)
Massing. Any exterior wall of a single-family detached dwelling which is longer than 20 feet and which faces a right-of-way or public space that is exterior to the development must incorporate exterior wall projections or recesses of at least 18 inches. Porches shall count toward this requirement, but chimneys shall not be counted toward this requirement.

Where two or more materials are proposed to be combined on a façade, the heavier material shall be located below the lighter material as shown in Illustration 11.3 in section 11-10.4(A)(1). Material changes on a façade shall occur along a continuous horizontal line or where two building forms meet. The use of brick, manufactured or natural stone, or stone veneer shall be considered equivalent for the purpose of material weight.
(ii)
Primary front façade materials shall wrap around at outside building corners at a continuous height until they reach an interior corner or another architectural feature. See Illustration 11.4 in section 11-10.4(a)(1).
(e)
Accessory structure materials.
(i)
The exterior of accessory buildings shall be constructed of similar materials, colors, and detailing to match those used on the principal structure(s).
(f)
In cases where a material is proposed but is not listed, the director shall make an administrative determination as to whether or not the material shall be permitted under present design standards based on the purpose and intent of this Article.
(2)
Site materials. Except as otherwise stated, use of the following materials is prohibited on the property:
(a)
Crushed color rock or tumbled glass;
(b)
Chain link fencing shall be permissible on the property provided it is vinyl coated. All vinyl coated chain link fences must be fully screened by vegetation and not visible from the public right-of-way.
(3)
Variation in facades. For the purpose of this subsection, a building façade shall be considered the entire wall surface on a building side from the finished grade level to the bottom of an overhanging eave or to the top of a cornice as shown in Illustration 11.5 in section 11-10.4(A)(2). The facades of multi-family buildings shall incorporate several design techniques to create an appropriate building scale and to provide distinction between similar structures.
(a)
All facades shall provide doors, porches, stoops, balconies, or windows in the following ratios:
(i)
A minimum of 40 percent of the front building façade.
(ii)
A minimum of 20 percent of the side building façade.
(iii)
A minimum of 30 percent of the rear building façade.
(iv)
Windowless walls are prohibited along all facades. A minimum of one-quarter of the front, side, and rear building façade ratio requirements shall be comprised of windows.
(b)
Faux window treatments shall be permitted for side and rear facades to comply with window ratio requirements.
(c)
For buildings over three stories, over 5,000 square feet in gross building footprint or with façades longer than 100 feet.
(i)
The "articulation interval" at which the repetitive element repeats should not be greater than 50 feet in length measured horizontally as shown in Illustration 11.9.
(ii)
The building shall provide a minimum of three of the following modulations or articulation design features listed below as shown in Illustration 11.9:
a)
Horizontal modulation. The stepping back or extending forward of building stories or horizontal building elements, the depth (extension out or set back from the building facade) of the modulation must be at least two feet when tied to a change in the roofline and at least five feet in other situations;
b)
Vertical modulation. The extension or stepping back of vertical elements of a building, the minimum depth of modulation is 18 inches and minimum width for each modulation is 15 feet;
c)
Porch, stoop, patio, deck or covered entry at each articulation interval;
d)
Distinctive window patterns repeated at intervals less than the articulation interval;
e)
Lighting fixtures, trellises, or other landscape features within each articulation interval;
f)
Incorporation of projections such as windows, porch additions, stair enclosures, chimneys, balconies, recesses at windows, entryways, doors or other openings, and minor projecting masses;
g)
Change in materials with a change in building plane;
h)
Use of materials and colors to emphasize both major and minor changes in building scale to introduce sense of detail and create distinctions between structures.

(4)
Blank walls. For the purpose of this section, a "blank wall" is any portion of wall that either has a surface area of at least 200 square feet of vertical surface without a window, door or building modulation or other architectural feature; or is over four feet in height from ground level and longer than 15 feet as measured horizontally without having a window, door, building modulation or other architectural feature as shown in Illustration 11.10. All blank walls visible from an adjacent or nearby lot, or a public street or private street, shall be treated in one or more of the following ways:
(a)
A vertical trellis in front of the wall with climbing vines or other plant material. The trellis must be used in conjunction with other treatments described below.
(b)
A landscaped planting bed or raised planter bed in front of the wall.
(1)
Plant material shall be selected to screen at least 50 percent of the blank wall's surface within four years.
(c)
A combination of building materials as listed in 11-10.4(b)(1)(a) and 11-10.4(b)(1)(b) to provide visual interest and craftmanship to building façades consistent with the purpose and intent of this article.

(5)
Exterior lighting.
(a)
Full cutoff fixtures shall be required with the exception of special architectural lighting that adheres to the following:
(i)
Uplighting shall be shielded by a roof overhang or a similar structural shield.
(ii)
Luminaires shall be aimed to shield the lamp and its reflective surfaces from off-site view and to prevent light output beyond the building.
(iii)
A licensed architect or engineer shall stamp a prepared lighting plan that ensures that all exterior lighting adheres to county design standards.
(6)
Roofs. All roofs shall comply with the following standards:
(a)
Roofs shall be symmetrical gables, flat with parapet along the front facing façade, hip-style, or shed style. Alternative roof forms or pitches may be used over porches, covered stoops, entryways, or similar features;
(b)
Shed style roofs shall have a minimum roof pitch of 4:12;
(c)
Symmetrical gable and hip-style roofs shall have a minimum roof pitch of 3:12;
(d)
Additional roof forms, such as dormers, shall be permitted to enhance the aesthetic of the roofline.
(e)
All building entrances shall be sheltered by roof forms, and/or additional roof features;
(f)
Overhangs, if provided, shall be no less than 12 inches;
(g)
For flat roofs or facades with horizontal fascia or parapet, the roofline shall vary at least every 60 feet. There shall be a minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation of two feet;
(h)
Other roof forms such as arched or saw-toothed may satisfy this design standard if the individual segments of the roof with no change in slope or discontinuity are less than 60 feet in width;
(i)
Sloped roofs on primary buildings shall be clad in wood shingles, standing seam metal, clay or concrete tile, stone coated metal tile, painted metal tile, recycled rubber tile, slate, asphalt shingles or similar material or combination of materials. This regulation does not prohibit the application of solar panels, which shall not be considered an architectural material for purposes of building form regulations;
(j)
In cases where an alternative roofing material is proposed but is not listed, the director shall make an administrative determination as to whether or not the material shall be permitted under present design standards based on the purpose and intent of this Article.
(7)
Site standards.
(a)
Sidewalks and pedestrian pathways shall provide a continuous network that connects each building entrance with adjacent public streets and all on-site amenities designed for use by residents of the development.
