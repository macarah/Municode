DIVISION 18. - UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENT

Sec. 2-541. - County provided.
(a)
Uniforms for employees, as the appointing authority may authorize, may be furnished by the county. Such other equipment as the appointing authority may deem essential to job performance may also be furnished. Upon termination of employment, an employee is expected to return all such equipment and uniforms to the employee's supervisor. The county may withhold an employee's final pay check until all equipment and uniforms are returned to such employee's supervisor.
(b)
Use of county-owned cellular telephones.
(1)
Cellular telephones are to be used for official business purposes only and when a safe, convenient, and less costly alternative isn't available.
(2)
For safety purposes, their use while operating a vehicle is strongly discouraged.
(3)
If a county-provided cellular telephone is used for personal business, the employee shall reimburse the county.
(4)
Department heads and the finance officer shall review the monthly invoices for services, air time, and toll charges. Reimbursement by employees for personal use, as noted above, shall be remitted monthly. Reimbursement will be credited to the department's telephone line item.
(5)
Department heads and supervisors shall carefully evaluate which employees are to be provided with cellular telephones. This shall take into consideration the employee's supervisor. In turn, damage rendering the telephone inoperable, its loss, or theft shall be reported to the vendor service provider as soon as possible to minimize liability for airtime and toll call charges.
(6)
If the damage, loss or theft is due to negligence, the employee shall be held financially responsible.
(7)
Failure of cell phone users to comply with the provisions of this policy may result in corrective or disciplinary action up to and including termination.
