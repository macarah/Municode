A resolution of the County of Ware for the promotion of public health, safety, morals, and general welfare and in furtherance of such purpose it is recognized that for the orderly and progressive development of land in Ware County within the unincorporated portion of said county the following, as it pertains to subdivisions of said land, this subdivision regulation is adopted; for repealing all conflicting resolutions; and for other purposes.
( Res. of 10-11-2016 , § I)
Sec. 67-2. - Short title.
This resolution shall be known as the Ware County Subdivision Regulations.
( Res. of 10-11-2016 , § II)
Sec. 67-3. - Intent, authority and definitions.
(a)
Subdivision regulations; intent. The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly and progressive development of land within the cities and counties of the state. In furtherance of this purpose, the subdivision of land is regulated by Ware County for the following purposes, among others:
(1)
To encourage the development of economically sound and stable county;
(2)
To assure the provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new land developments;
(3)
To assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land developments;
(4)
To assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and
(5)
To assure, in general, the wise development of new areas, in harmony with the master plan of the county.
(b)
Planning commission as platting authority. Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, 1976, grants authority to the governing body of each county and municipality to regulate subdivisions and land development. The Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission has adopted a master plan of major streets for Waycross-Ware County and has recommended regulations for the subdivision of land within the county, which plan, and regulations have been adopted and amended from time to time by the Ware County Board of Commissioners. A plat of a subdivision of land located within unincorporated Ware County with the State of Georgia O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67(d) exemption statement placed on such plat can be filed or recorded in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Ware County without the approval of the Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission. However, a building/mobile home or other development permit shall not be issued for any part of such plat of land that meets the exemption requirement. Such land/lots shown on a plat and recorded pursuant to the exemption language of O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67(d) (without the Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission approval) may be approved for development when such land/lots have been platted for development purposes and submitted to the Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission and meeting the Ware County Subdivision Regulations in effect at that time. The secretary of the planning commission shall enter such approval in writing on the plat.
However, the planning director shall administratively approve a simple subdivision plat containing no more than four lots within the entire subdivision provided all provisions of these regulations are met. The clerk of the Ware County Superior Court shall not file nor record a plat of any subdivision of land that does not have the approval of the planning commission or planning commission secretary or the O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67(d) statement as required by this resolution.
The filing or recording of a subdivision without such approvals as required by this resolution is hereby declared a violation of Ware County Codes and is punishable as provided in section 67-7.
(c)
Provision of regulations. The Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission has prepared and recommended to the Ware County Board of Commissioners regulations governing the subdivision of land within the unincorporated portion of Ware County. Such regulation provide for the harmonious development of the county; for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with other existing or planned streets or official map streets; for the size of blocks and lots; for the dedication or reservation of land for streets, school sites, recreation areas and easements for utilities and other public services and facilities; and for a distribution of population and traffic which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare.
(d)
Adoption of regulations. The Ware County Board of Commissioners has adopted and amended, as necessary, such land subdivision regulations after a public hearing thereon, alt least 15 days' notice of the time and place of which have been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
(e)
Effect of plat approval on status of dedications. The approval of a plat by the planning commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the county or the public of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat.
(f)
Acceptance of and improvements in unapproved streets. The Ware County Board of Commissioners or other public authority shall not accept, layout, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or lay or authorize the laying of any water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street within the county unless such street shall have been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of a public street prior to the said attachment of the planning commission's subdivision jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission or on a street plat made and adopted by said planning commission, provided, however, that the county may locate and construct or may accept any other street if the ordinance or resolution or other measure for such approval be first submitted to the planning commission for its review and comment; such street shall have the status of an approved street as fully as though it had been originally shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission or on a plat made and adopted by the planning commission.
(g)
Erection of buildings. No building permit shall be issued for and no building or other structure shall be erected on any lot within the county unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its locations and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the county. Any building erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the building inspector or county attorney or other official designated by the county may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.

Sec. 67-4. - Procedure.
Approval for the subdivision of land may be obtained from the Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission by proceeding through these three steps.
Step 1. An accurate survey of the property to be subdivided, plus all of the surrounding area to a distance of 100 feet, shall be made by a registered land surveyor. This survey should include all the land which the owner intends to subdivide in the foreseeable future. Prepare a reproducible drawing of the survey and make at least two white prints. The survey shall show the first 13 items of those required on a preliminary plat (see section 67-5(a)(2)). Add onto the two prints (to scale and in pencil) all additional required items to indicate how the owner would like to subdivide his land. Call the planning director for the Waycross-Ware County Planning Commission (hereinafter called the planning commission) to arrange a preliminary discussion and take the two prints to the meeting. After the conference, the planning director shall make an investigation and arrange a second meeting, during which agreement shall be reached on how the preliminary plat is to be prepared. This will complete Step 1. Between Step 1 and Step 2, the developer should consult with the Ware County Health Department as well as each public and private utility to be involved in the proposed development. Preparations should be pursued for a registered surveyor or engineer, landscape architect or soil scientist to prepare a soil erosion sedimentation control plan and stormwater drainage plan to be submitted with preliminary plat to the planning director.
Step 2. Prepare a preliminary plat, as previously agreed upon, to the specifications described hereinafter and including all required items. Transmit the white prints of the completed drawing to the planning director. If the plat is acceptable and is submitted at least ten days before a regular meeting of the planning commission with a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and a stormwater drainage plan, the plat shall be placed on the agenda of that meeting for a consideration. Plats received less than ten days before a regular meeting of the planning commission may be carried over to the next succeeding meeting. At the conclusion of the regular meeting, the planning commission shall either approve (fully or conditionally) or disapprove the preliminary plat as submitted. Approval of the preliminary plat completes Step 2.
Step 3. Prepare a final plat to the specifications described hereinafter and including all required items. It is not required that the final plat shall include all the area of the preliminary plat. The final plat may include only that portion of the subdivision which is needed in the immediate future. Additional portions may be submitted subsequently. Transmit the original tracing and two white prints of the final plat to the planning director. If the plat is acceptable and is submitted at least ten days before a regular meeting of the planning commission with approvals of the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and stormwater drainage plan, the plat shall be placed on the agenda of that meeting. All street, drainage and utilities improvements required to serve the proposed subdivision shall have been completed prior to approval of the final plat. Approval of the final plat by the planning commission shall not constitute acceptance by the county of the dedication of any streets or other public grounds. Upon approval of the final plat, the secretary of the planning commission shall submit the plat to the county commission for action upon the offers of dedication. When the dedications have been accepted, the secretary shall then file the final plat in the office of the clerk of the superior court as prescribed by law.
Before the final plat is filed, however, a reproducible positive shall be made from the original signed tracing and transmitted to the planning director. A computer disc record of the approved final plat shall be submitted to the planning director. This completes the subdivision process.
