(q)
Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where such building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the office of the director of public works for the lines of the public street on which he proposes to build, erect, or locate such building. It shall be the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon except as provided for in chapter 32 of the Standard Building Code.
(r)
Contractor's responsibilities. It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which a permit is required to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted.
(s)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes adopted in section 14-36, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of this article. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official.
(2)
Issued on basis of affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. If such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official.
(t)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permit drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative.
(u)
Fees.

Except as otherwise specified in this article, all telecommunications towers and accessory structures and uses shall comply with development setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located.
(5)
Telecommunications towers shall not be permitted within a 1,000-foot radius of another telecommunications tower except within tower farms.
(6)
Telecommunications towers shall be set back not less than 100 feet from any property line adjacent to a right-of-way or approved access easement.
(7)
Building height limitations in the zoning districts in which a telecommunications facility or alternative tower structure is located shall not apply to such facilities and structures; provided, however, sound engineering evidence must demonstrate that proposed tower height is the minimum necessary to achieve parity.
(c)
Regulatory compliance
(1)
All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations as set forth by the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communication towers and antennae. If said standards and regulations are modified then the owners of the communication towers and antennae governed by this article shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency.
(2)
Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(d)
Security. A chain link fence or wall not less than eight feet in height, from finished grade equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device shall be provided around each communication tower, or the communication center. Access to the tower(s) shall be through a locked gate. Damaged fencing must be repaired or replaced within 30 days from when the damage occurred.
(e)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA, or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the administrator may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance.
(f)
Signs and advertising. Neither the tower nor the tower site shall be used for advertising purposes nor contain any signs for the purpose of advertising. A small sign may be placed on the entrance gate not to exceed four square feet in total area. All signage must be in accordance with Effingham County Ordinances.
(g)
Visual impact.
(1)
Communication towers shall follow FAA painting requirements or FAA published standards for finish color.
(2)
Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effects are less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.
(h)
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property, and residential property and shall consist of the following:
(1)
A landscaped buffer area a minimum of ten feet in width shall be maintained around the exterior of the security fencing.
(2)
The buffer area is to consist of materials of the evergreen variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge of at least five feet in height within two years of planting.
(3)
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which was lost.
(4)
Trees and scrubs in the vicinity of the guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance.
(5)
In lieu of these standards, the administrator may allow use of an alternate detailed plan for landscape and screening, however, such plans must be prepared by a registered landscape architect and satisfy the requirements of this subsection, except cases in which lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries, and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the administrator.
(i)
Principal, accessory, and joint uses.
(1)
Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage, or other outdoor usage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the tower site, unless repairs to the tower and/or related equipment are being made.
(2)
Towers may be located on sites containing another principle use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation, and general requirements of this article are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower the greater of 100 percent breakpoint or 25 feet. If applicant's engineer certifies a fall zone or separation greater than listed above, the engineer's specification governs. The aforementioned separation requirements are required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
(3)
Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive, or hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, propane, gasoline, natural gas, and dangerous chemicals.
(j)
Historic sites. Telecommunications facilities shall not be attached to the facade or parapet of any architecturally or historically significant building or structure located in a recognized historical area. Antennae shall be permitted only on rooftops of buildings and structures a minimum of 50 feet in height, provided that such attachments shall not be visible from adjacent pedestrian walkways or streets, do not adversely impact the structural integrity or significance of the building or structure, and so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the structure.
(k)
Adherence to FAA regulations. The passage of the ordinance from which this article derives requires adherence to Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and that all placement of towers and antennae must be approved by the FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally granted by the completion of form "FAA Form 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration" or its equivalent.
