Section 2502-B. - Dwelling in residential zones.
Dwellings, single-family, to include mobile homes, manufactured homes or modular or industrialized buildings as defined herein, shall not be permitted in residential districts except when placement of said dwelling complies with the requirements and limitations set forth in this ordinance [article] as applying generally to residential use in such zoning classifications, including but not limited to minimum lots, yard and building spacing, square footage requirements, percentage of lot coverage, off-street parking requirements and approved foundations as described herein, and which additionally meet the following compatibility standards:
A.
The dwelling compares favorably to site built and other housing in the immediate general area within the same zoning or residential district or area. Approval to place the manufactured home, mobile home or modular building shall be granted by the Zoning Administrator upon application and determination that the dwelling is substantially similar in size, siding material, roof material, foundation and general aesthetic appearance to:
(1)
Site-built or other forms of housing which may be permitted in the same general area under this ordinance [article], or
(2)
Existing development, or
(3)
Proposed development in the same zoning classification or area, or as envisioned in the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Statesboro.
B.
In making a determination of compatibility, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall further consider:
(1)
The possible negative effect of the structure on the property values of other properties in the immediate area, and
(2)
The possible effect the structure could have on the surrounding area in the event of inclement weather or high winds;
C.
All towing devices, wheels, axles and hitches must be removed.
D.
At each exit door there must be a landing that is a minimum of 36 inches by 36 inches. The structure has a minimum width in excess of 16 feet.

The roof shall have a minimum of 2:12 roof pitch and shall have a surface of wood shakes, asphalt composition, wood shingles, concrete, fiberglass or metal tiles, slate, built up gravel materials, or other materials approved by the Zoning Administrator.
F.
The exterior siding materials shall consist of wood, masonry, concrete, stucco, masonite, metal or vinyl lap or other materials of like appearance.
G.
The structure shall be attached to a permanent foundation, to include foundation walls. With the exception of placement of structures in parks as specified in section 2304 below, skirting of structures is not sufficient to comply with the requirements of this section.
H.
The structure is constructed according to the standards established by the Standard Building Code adopted by the city and in effect at the time of erection or placement. A manufactured home unit must bear the label or seal of compliance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Any mobile home or manufactured home unit manufactured before June 15, 1976, shall not be allowed within the city. Any mobile home or manufactured home unit manufactured after June 15, 1976, not bearing such seal or label shall be reported to the state administrative agency having jurisdiction and shall not be granted a certificate of occupancy. Any modular or industrialized home must bear any labels, stamps or seals of compliance required by the Department of Community Affairs or the City of Statesboro.
I.
Other than as provided in sections 2303 and 2304 herein, mobile homes, manufactured homes or modular buildings shall be placed only on land owned by and titled in the name of a principal occupant of the structure. If by placement of the mobile, manufactured home or modular building the owner qualifies for the homestead exemption, then the home shall be assessed as real property for ad valorem taxes.
J.
Other than as provided in sections 2303 and 2304 herein, the owner shall, prior to placement of a structure, submit to the City Engineer or designee an application containing the following:
(1)
Applicant's name and address and his or her representative, and the interest of every person represented in the application.
(2)
A statement of circumstances in the proposed district and the abutting district in which the structure is to be placed;
(3)

(4)
Specifications or pre-design plans which contain a complete description of the structure to include square footage, siding material, roof material and pitch, foundation and other evidence of the general aesthetic appearance required by the Zoning Administrator or designee and necessary to make a determination of compliance and compatibility as required by this ordinance [article].
(5)
Documents certifying that the structure is in compliance with the Standard Building Code and any other codes, regulations or manufacturing standards as required by this ordinance [article].
(6)
Evidence of title in the land on which the structure is to be placed.
K.
It shall be a violation of this ordinance [article] to occupy any structure without first obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy from the Zoning Code Administrator or his designee, who shall before issuing a Certificate of Occupancy determine that the structure is in compliance with the terms of this ordinance [article] and all other zoning requirements and city ordinances. In the event the Zoning Code Administrator or his designee is unable to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria established by this ordinance [article], the Zoning Code Administrator may refer the matter to the city council for a final determination of applicability.
L.
The city council may approve a variance or deviation from one or more of the development or architectural standards provided herein on the basis of finding that the material to be utilized or the architectural style proposed for the dwelling will be compatible and harmonious with existing structures in the vicinity.
The applicant must apply for the variance and carry the burden of proof to establish that the home is compatible with surrounding homes. The criteria should include such factors as exterior materials, square footage, foundation type and other factors as deemed necessary for compliance and compatibility as required by this ordinance [article]. The city council shall further consider the possible negative effect of the structure on the property values of other properties in the immediate area and the possible effect the structure could have on the surrounding area in the event of inclement weather or high winds.
M.
