Sec. 32-1. - Sale of parcels of property too small to be used independently.
The City Council is hereby authorized to sell and convey parcels of property owned by the City which are narrow strips of land so shaped or so small as to be incapable of being used independently as zoned or under applicable subdivision regulations or other development ordinances or as streets whether the property is owned in fee by the City or has been obtained by grant of easement.

Upon receipt of any such proposals from any abutting property owners, the City shall be authorized to negotiate with such property owners, and the City Council shall by motion authorize the sale of such property on such terms as the City Council determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the City.

(d)
Requirements for insurance, bonding or other security. To avoid interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, any requirement imposed for surety for performance (including, but not limited to, insurance, bonding, or monetary deposits) shall be based upon needs directly associated with the event and not on the basis of possible disruption of the event by protestors or other persons who might be opposed to the speech or assembly.

( Ord. No. 2019-12, 3-4-2019 )
Sec. 32-40. - Expedited or extended application review.
(a)
Upon request of an applicant, the permit review committee may agree to an expedited application review when the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the standard review process (1) is not required due to size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors, indicating that public safety, welfare, and convenience would not be affected by expedited review or (2) would substantially burden protected rights, including speech and assembly, as to matters of public concern and the expedited review process would allow reasonable review to address substantial matters of public safety, welfare, and convenience.
(b)
Upon determining that the size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors that affect public safety, welfare, and convenience, require more intensive review of an application, the permit review committee, after notice to the applicant, may extend the standard review period by a time not to exceed 72 hours.
( Ord. No. 2019-12, 3-4-2019 )

(2)
When reviewing an application, the police chief shall determine whether and to what extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for traffic control and public safety and welfare, including public convenience. The police chief shall base this decision on relevant criteria including, but not limited to, the size (including participants, spectators, counter-demonstrators), location, duration, time and date of the event; the number of streets and intersections blocked; and the need to detour or preempt public travel and use of streets and sidewalks.
(3)
The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary.
(4)
If additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the police chief, he shall so inform the permit review committee and applicant. The applicant shall be responsible for bearing the cost of the additional police protection deemed necessary by the Police Chief.
(b)

(c)
Other expenses. In circumstances where the event itself may be expected to cause the City to incur additional, extraordinary expenses, the permit review committee shall identify such expenses and the basis for determining them to be extraordinary. Such expenses may be imposed upon the applicant as a condition of approval of the permit.

(a)
Upon receiving an application, the permit review committee shall determine within 48 hours if the application is complete or if any additional preliminary information is required and shall so inform the applicant. The applicant shall provide such required information prior to further consideration of the application. The requirement to supplement the application at this stage does not prevent the permit review committee from requiring additional information during its review and action upon the application.
(b)
After accepting an application, the permit review committee shall forward it for review and comment to the Police Department, Public Works Department, and to any other city department, employee, official or board deemed appropriate. Such review and comment shall occur within three days unless that period is extended by the permit review committee.

(g)
The permit review committee may authorize the conduct of the event at a date, time, location, or route different from that proposed by the applicant.
