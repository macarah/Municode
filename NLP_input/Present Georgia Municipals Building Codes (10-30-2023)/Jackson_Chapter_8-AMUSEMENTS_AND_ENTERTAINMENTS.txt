Sec. 8-32. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments, including but not limited to adult bookstores, adult movie houses, adult video stores or adult dancing establishments. Such establishments are known to attract persons involved in criminal activity. Such establishments tend to create an atmosphere and environment contrary to the best interests of minors. However, it is recognized that regulation of such businesses cannot be used to prohibit otherwise constitutionally protected forms of expression. The purpose of the policies and procedures contained in this article are to reduce the possibility of criminal activity, to avoid negative impact upon minors and neighborhoods and to provide a method whereby persons interested in conducting constitutionally-protected businesses can seek and obtain a permit to do so from the city government.
