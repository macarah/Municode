(c)
In structures described in subsection (b) of this section, a combination fire protection sprinkler system shall be allowed. A combination fire protection system, for purposes of this section, means that the sprinkler system and the domestic water system utilize the same (common) service water supply pipe to the premises. Such system shall comply with the following:
(1)
Calculations of pipe size shall be based on the lowest pressure of a twenty-four (24) chart and must be approved by the authority having jurisdiction prior to permitting sprinkler flow at the highest elevation most hydraulically remote sprinkler water supply in the building.

A union and full-port shut-off valve, acceptable to the administrative authority, shall be installed on both sides of the spring loaded check valve to facilitate removal for test and repair. If sprinkler system static pressure exceeds one hundred sixty (160) PSI, a pressure reducing valve must be used set at approximately one hundred twenty-five (125) PSI. A Watts W.T.S. 530C50 or equivalent reseating pressure relief valve shall be used on all domestic sprinkler systems.

L. listed. A circulating system may be used. The terminal end of the sprinkler supply shall be tied directly into the supply of a regularly used water closet or other approved fixture.

(8)
All fire sprinklers used shall be U. L. listed, fast response residential sprinklers for either pendent or sidewall use.
(9)
The spacing of pendent heads shall be a maximum of eight (8) feet from any wall unless U. L. listed for greater coverage.
(10)
The spacing of sidewall sprinklers shall be in accordance with U. L. listing. Exception: Maximum distance from ceiling to heat collector not to exceed four and one-half (4½) inches.
(11)
Sprinklers are not required in bathrooms, closets of less than thirty (30) square feet, foyers, halls or attics. All other areas require sprinklers including drive-in garages and basements, finished or unfinished. Exception: Meet hazardous area hourly fire rating for drive-in garages.
(12)
