600-30.02
Findings.
A.
The City finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of their idea or identification of their premises.
B.
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs throughout the City is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the City, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citizens of the City.
C.
The City further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by a public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Virtually all signs erected by public authority are for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings or facilities, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The City finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
D.
The City finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
E.
In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the City, the City has considered planning studies, reports, news articles, town hall meetings with business owners, sign vendors and related information from a variety of sources. In this ordinance the City strives to balance the variety of interests impacted by signage and potential regulation. The City finds that the specifics of regulation satisfy the legal requirements for sign regulation and balance the various interests of all who are impacted by sign regulation. The materials accompanying adoption of this ordinance attest to the significance and compelling nature of the City's interests as do numerous judicial decisions. While regulating signs, however, the City has been mindful and careful to afford ample methods and alternatives to communicate both commercial and non-commercial messages.
F.
The City finds that advances in technology utilizing LED components results in signs brighter in appearance for LED signs than for signs not utilizing LED technology. While exact measurements have not been determined, some of the explanation for the additional brightness by LED signs is that the field of light projection is diametrically opposed to that of standard billboards. Standard billboard lighting, whether ground mounted or platform mounted, is directed at the billboard itself, leaving very little light emission elsewhere; whereas, the LED sign faces the road system providing a brighter, more readable sign. Studies, particularly during non-daylight hours, demonstrate that attention given by drivers to such signs is longer than attention given to non-LED signs. These studies and their conclusions have been compiled and are presented in Compendium of Recent Research Studies on Distraction from Commercial Electronic Variable Message Signs prepared by the Veridian Group in February 2016 discussing a variety of studies conducted since 2008. As a result of these and other studies pertaining to billboard research and information, the City has determined that use of LED technology on outdoor signage in the City requires unique regulation as a result of potential driver distractions and competing traffic interferences. Regulations developed in this chapter are designed to find an appropriate balance between allowance of such new technologies and protection of the public interest.
G.
This Chapter is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this chapter. It is not the intent of this Chapter to apply regulation to signs based upon the message that they convey. It is not the intent of this chapter to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious or personal messages. Furthermore, it is not the intent of the City, nor any of its boards, commissions, or agents, to regulate, in any manner, the message content of signs, expect to the extent of obscenity or other messages prohibited by state or federal law.
H.
This Chapter shall be a separate and distinct ordinance and not a part of Title 2: Zoning of this UDO.
I.
Categories for zoning and land use as related to sign locations in Section 600-250 of this Chapter are defined by the zoning categories set forth in Title 2: Zoning of this UDO.

600-220.02
Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delimits the sign face.

Existing grade prior to construction; or
B.
The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.

Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied.
