3.

b.
Litter removal and repair order. If the complaint includes a dwelling, building or structure requiring repair and such repair can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, then the order shall require the following:

Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer is also authorized to file a motion for attachment for contempt against the owner with the court that issued the order as an alternate or additional remedy.
(14)
Salvage. Reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the clean up and removal of debris. Proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the county shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

Generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage, or defect, is not suitable for classification as a "used tire," or "retreadable casing" as defined in this article. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used," retreadable casings" or "scrap tires," then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tiers and must be thusly indicated on the shipment manifest.
(e)
Scrap tires carriers.
(1)
Unless otherwise exempted, any person collecting or transporting scrap tires shall have a scrap tire carrier permit issued by the environmental protection division. No permit shall be issued unless the financial assurance, as provided for in the rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division, Chapter 391-3-4, Solid Waste Management, paragraph (e)(4), has been submitted to the environmental protection division.

1.
For the purpose of this paragraph, "tire handling business" means persons whose income is at least partially derived from the sale, processing, transporting or disposal of tires.

(a)
The county board of commissioners do hereby find that:
(1)
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
(2)
Second-hand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities and cancer.
(b)
Accordingly, the county board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this article are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in certain indoor public places and in certain public and private places of employment; and
(2)
To balance the need of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air with the desire of smokers to enjoy tobacco products in public places.
