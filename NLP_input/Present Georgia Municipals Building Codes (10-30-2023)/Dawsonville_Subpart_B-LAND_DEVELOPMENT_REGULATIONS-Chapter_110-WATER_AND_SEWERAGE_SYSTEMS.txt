Sec. 110-32. - Looping easement requirements.
The overall distribution plan adhered to by the city requires looping of water lines. This looping provides adequate fire flow protection while eliminating dead ends and stagnated water. It is the city's policy to require 20-foot wide utility easements between lots in new subdivisions where a loop cannot be installed to connect to another subdivision or main line in the future. The design engineer should determine the location of possible future development around the proposed subdivision, consider the ease of construction of a loop to the future development, and discuss these with the city. All easements must be shown on the plans and on the final recorded plat as 20-foot utility easements dedicated to the city. The developer must lay the water line along the entire length of each required easement to the adjoining property with a dead-end gate valve at the end. No dead-end lines allowed over 1,000 feet unless approved by the city engineer.
