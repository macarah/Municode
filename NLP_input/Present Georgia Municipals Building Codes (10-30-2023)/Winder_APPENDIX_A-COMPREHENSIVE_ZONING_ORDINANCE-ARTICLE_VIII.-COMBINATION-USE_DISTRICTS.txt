ARTICLE VIII. - COMBINATION-USE DISTRICTS

Sec. 8-1. - Combination-use districts.
A.
This article shall be collectively known, cited, and referred to as the Combination Use Districts of the City of Winder, Georgia (hereinafter "Combination Use Districts").
B.
The following zoning districts are established as Combination Use Districts:
1.
Mixed-Use (MU);
2.
Downtown (DT).
C.
Applicability. The standards contained in this section apply to all Mixed Use Districts.
D.
Administrative variances.
1.
The Zoning Administrator is authorized to grant administrative variances to the requirements of Combination Use Districts.
2.
Administrative variances may provide relief from any of the requirements of the Combination Use Districts, but may not be used to increase permitted density, increase maximum height more than 5 feet, or permit a use that is not allowed.
3.
Administrative variances may only be granted to permit a practice that is not consistent with a specific provision of these regulations, but is justified by their purpose.
4.
In addition to the general criteria for variances provided in Sec. 11-7, administrative variances relating to a physical element or numeric measurement must be based upon credible submitted evidence demonstrating that:
i.
Approval, if granted, would not offend the purposes indicated in Sec. 8-2A or Sec. 8-3A;
ii.
There are such extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property such that the literal or strict application of the regulations would create an unnecessary hardship due to size, shape, or topography or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions not caused by the applicant;
iii.
Relief, if granted, would not cause a substantial detriment to the public good and surrounding properties; and
iv.
That the public safety, health and welfare are secured, and that substantial justice is done.
E.
Building types. Within Combination Use Districts, building types are used to regulate the design of buildings. Each building type is described below and is determined by the Zoning Administrator.

3.
The Zoning Administrator may modify the block perimeter requirements by administrative variance when steep slopes in excess of 25%, preexisting development, tree protection areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space, or easements would make the provision of a complete block infeasible.

There is no maximum block perimeter length when a block contains a park of at least one acre in size and when no other use is located in that block.
5.
Cul-de-sacs are prohibited except on local streets where topography, environmental protection, preservation of cultural resources, or similar considerations prohibit the creation of street connections. In no case shall any dead-end street be greater than 600 feet in length.

If a stub-out street exists on an abutting parcel, the street system of any new development must connect to the stub-out street to form a through street.
5.
The Zoning Administrator may grant an administrative variance to eliminate the requirement for a stub-out street or require pedestrian and bicycle only access when steep slopes in excess of 25%, highways, waterways, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space, civic space, or easements would make the provision of a stub-out street infeasible.
