(2)
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an undue hardship; and
(3)
Such conditions are particular to the particular piece of property involved and not the making of the applicant; and
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good, or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter; and
(5)
The proposed use will be of such location, size, and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood; and
(6)
The proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved; and
(7)
The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible nuisance emanating from the use which might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby permitted uses whether by reason of dust, noises, fumes, vibration, smoke, or lights; and
(8)
The location and height of buildings or structures and the location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage appropriate development and the use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
