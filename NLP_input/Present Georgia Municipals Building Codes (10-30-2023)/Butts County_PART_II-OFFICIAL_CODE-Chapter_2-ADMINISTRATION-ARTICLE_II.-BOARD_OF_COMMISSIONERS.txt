DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-31. - [Procedures for disposing of unserviceable county property.]
(a)
The property shall be identified with as much specificity as practicable, and the reasons why the property should be deemed unserviceable shall be presented to the county board of commissioners in an open and public meeting.
(b)
The county board of commissioners shall have the final authority to determine if the property is unserviceable and should be sold; this determination shall be made by majority vote at an open and public meeting.
(c)
With respect to all property found to be unserviceable and ordered sold by the county board of commissioners, the county manager or county clerk shall cause a notice to be published in the legal organ of the county stating that the property shall be offered for sale by sealed bid. The notice shall identify the property to be sold, and shall state when and where the property may be inspected prior to sale. The deadline for submitting sealed bids shall be clearly stated.
(d)
The sealed bids shall be opened at a public meeting of the county board of commissioners and read in open session. The county board of commissioners, by majority vote, shall have the authority to sell the property to the highest bidder, or to reject all bids and request new bids. The county board of commissioners shall terminate the proceedings to sell the property if any bid has been opened or tampered with prior to the public meeting.
(e)
As an alternative to paragraphs (c) and (d) above, the county board of commissioners may direct that unserviceable property be sold at public auction. When this process is selected the commissioners may hire a qualified auctioneer to preside over and conduct the sale, and the auctioneer may be paid a reasonable fee or percentage of the total sale for said services. Prior to any public auction taking place, the county manager or county clerk shall cause a notice to be published in the legal organ of the county, listing the property to be sold, when and where it may be inspected, and the date, time and place of the public auction.
(f)
A county employee, officer or elected official other than a county commissioner and the county manager shall not be prohibited from submitting a sealed bid or making an offer to purchase unserviceable county property at a public auction, provided the provisions of this section are followed, it being the intent of the county board of commissioners to give all persons the same and equal opportunity to purchase such property.
(g)
This section shall not apply to the sale or disposition of real property, as such dispositions are governed by a separate and distinct provision of Georgia law.

DIVISION 2. - MEETINGS

Sec. 2-56. - Open meetings.
All meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq. The public shall at all times be afforded access to all meetings other than executive sessions.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.01)
Sec. 2-57. - Quorum.
A quorum must be present for conducting meetings of the board. A quorum is a majority of all the members of the board then in office. It is the duty of the chairman to enforce this rule. Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chairman if he believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, a commissioner leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting cannot continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting will be rescheduled by the chairman with the approval of the commissioners present.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.02)
Sec. 2-58. - Voting majority.
Passage of a motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of commissioners present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Unless otherwise specified in these procedures, a majority shall mean more than one-half of the commissioners present excluding abstentions. Where a two-thirds majority is specified, a majority vote shall mean at least two-thirds of the commissioners present excluding abstentions (i.e., four of five, three of four, two of three).
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.03)
Sec. 2-59. - Abstentions.
A commissioner shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest which could prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner. If a conflict of interest does exist, the commissioner shall explain for the record his decision to abstain on any vote.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.04)
Sec. 2-60. - Chairman.
The board shall select a chairman from the board members at the beginning of each calendar year. The chairman of the board of commissioners is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to fulfill this duty, the chairman must enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners. The chairman shall be impartial and conduct the meetings in a fair manner. The chairman, being duly elected as a commissioner representing a district of the county, may introduce or second motions and shall vote on all matters.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.05)
Sec. 2-61. - Vice-chairman.
The board shall select a vice-chairman from the board members at the beginning of each calendar year. The vice-chairman shall fulfill the duties of the chairman if the chairman is not in attendance. If the chairman and the vice-chairman are absent and a quorum is present, the remaining commissioners shall select a commissioner to serve as temporary chairman of the meeting until either the chairman or vice-chairman is present at the meeting.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.06)
Sec. 2-62. - Agenda.
The county manager, with the advice of the chairman and the commissioners, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. An agenda shall be made available to the commissioners at least one business day before every board meeting. All requests for placement on the agenda must be received by the county manager at least two business days before the meeting. A new item or subject that requires urgent attention may be added to the agenda during a meeting by a two-thirds vote of the board. A copy of the agenda and a list of those members present shall be made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of any meeting.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.07; Res. No. 2020-12, 7-13-2020)
Sec. 2-63. - Consent agenda.
A consent agenda may be prepared by the county manager for the board to unanimously adopt motions on routine items. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and where no debate is expected may be placed on a consent agenda. At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chairman shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.08; Res. No. 2020-12, 7-13-2020)
Sec. 2-64. - Minutes.
The clerk of the board shall promptly record the minutes for each board meeting. The minutes serve as the official written record of the board meeting and shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the board but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the board. The minutes shall specify the names of commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the commissioner who proposed each motion, the commissioner who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll call vote, the name of each commissioner voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a commissioner has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the board. The board must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the board. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the commissioners at least one business day before the following meeting and shall be signed by each commissioner attending the meeting. The minutes of the previous meetings shall be corrected and approved by the board at the beginning of each regular meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be attested to by the clerk of the board of commissioners.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.09)
Sec. 2-65. - Order of business.
All regular board meetings should follow an established order of business. The order is as follows:
(1)
Call to order
(2)
Approval of minutes
(3)
Invited guests
(4)
Reports from committees and departments
(5)
Consent agenda
(6)
Old business
(7)
New business
(8)
Public comments
(9)
Adjournment.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.10)
Sec. 2-66. - Decorum.
All commissioners must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the chairman and not to individual commissioners, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. A commissioner is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the chairman. All comments made by a commissioner shall address the motion being discussed. The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a commissioner believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he can allow the board to debate the issues and decide the issue by majority vote.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.11)
Sec. 2-66a. - Conduct during meetings.
During the public portions of Public Meetings and Public Hearings members of the Butts County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the Chair;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the Chair, if he is ruled out of order by the Chair;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session;
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ___________?" or "Do you remember telling me ___________?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ___________," or "Why did you tell me ___________ before the meeting." The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representatives and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session;
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in a such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session;
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so;
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken;
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
Sec. 2-66b. - Conduct outside of meetings.
A member of the Butts County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county manager. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county manager regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county manager first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the county manager. If a commissioner believes the county manager should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel.
(4)
Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outline in Section II, Rule 1, above.
(6)
Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request.
(7)
Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act, or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners.
(8)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(9)
Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for any commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Butts county by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additionally legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(10)
Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Butts County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(Res. No. 2020-12, 7-13-2020)
Sec. 2-66c. - Penalties.
The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this Ordinance. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this Ordinance to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in Executive Session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board of commissioners present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner:
(1)
A verbal censure that shall be noted in the Minutes without further elaboration;
(2)
A written censure, to be made a part of the Minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
(3)
Removal of the commissioner from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending commissioner is in involved in his capacity as Butts County Commissioner; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the board of commissioners, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending commissioner is no longer authorized to represent Butts County. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offense.
(4)
A fine, not to exceed $500 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending commissioner to the general fund of Butts County, Georgia within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner.
Sec. 2-67. - Public participation.
Public participation in meetings of the board of commissioners shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(1)
Public comments. The final agenda item of the meetings shall be reserved for comments from the public. All members of the public who wish to address the board must submit their name and the topic of their comments to the county manager at least three business days before the board meeting. These individuals will be allotted three minutes to make their comments, and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board.
(2)
Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board may allow public comment of an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board.
(3)
Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners. Individuals who violate any rules of the board may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board will rule on the point of order. Any individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman.
(4)
Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board. Hearings may be held immediately prior to, during or following a meeting of the board, or at such other places and times as the board may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing unless it is conducted during a regular or called meeting of the board.

A regular meeting may be canceled, rescheduled or moved to a new location within the county site by the chairman for any reason. Other special meetings may be scheduled by the chairman or at the request of two commissioners. Whenever a rescheduled regular meeting or any other special meeting is to be held at a time or place other than the regularly scheduled time or place, written notice of the change shall be posted for at least 24 hours at the place of the regular meetings.

The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the commissioners present, those voting for the executive session and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session may be maintained by the clerk of the board of commissioners at the direction of the chairman.

Secs. 2-77—2-100. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE

Sec. 2-101. - Main motion.
In order for a board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.01)
Sec. 2-102. - Debate.
After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-106). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: Debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-107). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.02)
Sec. 2-103. - Voting procedure.
Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections then the chair can proceed with the vote.
b.
If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.03)
Sec. 2-104. - Undebatable motions.
In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.03)
Sec. 2-105. - Ranking of motions.
Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list.
(1)
Lowest rank: Main motion.
(2)
Subsidiary motions (debatable):
a.
Postpone indefinitely.
b.
Amend.
c.
Refer to committee (commit).
d.
Postpone to a time certain.
(3)
Subsidiary motions (undebatable):
a.
Limit debate or extend limits.
b.
Vote immediately (previous question).
c.
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
(4)
Privileged motions (undebatable):
a.
Question of privilege.
b.
Recess.
(5)
Highest rank: Adjourn.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.04)
Sec. 2-106. - Subsidiary motions.
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions: amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(4)
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a two-thirds vote is required.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.05)
Sec. 2-107. - Privileged motions.
Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(3)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.06)
Sec. 2-108. - Incidental motions.
Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their right as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(1)
Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(2)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(3)
Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(4)
Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.07)
Sec. 2-109. - Supplementary main motions.
Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the way specified.
(1)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and vote the original motion.
(2)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-62. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(3)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
