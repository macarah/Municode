This chapter, including the zoning map of the city, may be amended from time to time by the mayor and city council, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall have first been submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendation.
(b)
The planning commission may, but is not required to, hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment, and shall submit its recommendations to the city council within 60 days of its first meeting after it has received an amendment request complete in all respects.

(c)
If the planning commission fails to submit a report to the city council within 60 days of its first meeting after it has received an amendment request complete in all respects, it shall be deemed to have made no recommendation on the proposed amendment. However, the planning commission and the applicant for an amendment may jointly agree to an extension of the 60 days period.
(d)
Before the mayor and city council enact this chapter or an amendment thereto, they shall hold a public hearing thereon. The notice of such hearing shall be published at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The notice shall state the time, place, and the purpose of the hearing, and in addition shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property and the proposed zoning classification of the property.

In addition, the chair of the planning commission shall ensure that a sign is erected in a conspicuous location on the property involved, at least 15 days and not more than 45 days before the public hearing of the mayor and city council, giving notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing.
(f)
In enacting an amendment to the zoning map and zoning ordinance for a particular property or properties, the mayor and council may consider any variances or conditions offered or sought in conjunction with that amendment without those variances or conditions being separately considered or approved by the planning and zoning commission. Nothing in this section shall prelude the planning and zoning commission from recommending variances or conditions in conjunction with an amendment. If there is an appeal related to any such amendment, variances or conditions offered or sought in conjunction with that amendment, shall be included as part of that appeal.

(Code 2004, § 39-1501.2)
Sec. 78-395. - Policies and procedures which govern the calling and conducting of hearings.

At the official public hearing, the applicant for the amendment shall first be afforded a reasonable opportunity to explain why the rezoning and amendment are being sought. Thereafter, all interested persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to speak either for or against the rezoning amendment. The mayor may limit speakers to a reasonable time, which shall in no case be less than ten minutes per side, and may limit irrelevant or repetitious comments and shall maintain the order and dignity of the hearing process. In no event shall the size of the audience, nor the emotions of any of the attendees, be a valid consideration of the city council in acting upon a proposed amendment. Public comments should offer facts relevant to the standards set forth in section 78-394.
(c)
All meetings, both regular and special, at which an amendment to this chapter is to be discussed, considered, or acted upon by the city council shall be open to the public. Notice of special meetings shall be given in accordance with the Georgia Open Meetings Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq.

Failure to provide notice as required by this chapter shall be grounds for the final action on a proposed amendment to be declared null and void. It is the responsibility of the applicant for rezoning to satisfy himself prior to the public hearing that proper notice requirements have been met. Failure to object at the public hearing shall constitute a waiver of claims based upon improper publication of any notice or the posting on the property.
