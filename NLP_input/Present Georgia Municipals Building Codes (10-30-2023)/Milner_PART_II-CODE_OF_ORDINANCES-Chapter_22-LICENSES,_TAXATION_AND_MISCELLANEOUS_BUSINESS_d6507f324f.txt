ARTICLE VIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 22-211. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values.
(b)
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and live commercial nudity in general, are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and commercial nudity in general, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
(c)
Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to insure that adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment establishments in heavily used public pedestrian areas.
(d)
Therefore, the limitation of adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment.
