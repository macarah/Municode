The civilian review board will provide a process to review certain claims that have been made against members of the city police department. The present process can be summarized as follows:
(b)
The police department presently responds to citizens' complaints by having the complaint investigated by the appropriate supervisor.

At any point in the process, an investigation can be made beyond that conducted by the supervisor or the chief of police can refer a complaint to the internal affairs office of the police department. Upon completion of the investigation, the complaining party is notified by the city police department, via telephone, e-mail or letter of its findings.
(c)
Given that the purpose of this board is to assure accountability to the citizens of the city, the city commission has made the decision to structure a process for further review of complaints arising out of alleged abusive language, excessive force, and harassment. If an individual feels like their complaint was not properly handled, then within 30 days of the police department's having made its decision, the complaining party must complete an Allegation of Employee Misconduct Form and mail it to:
Police department Civilian Review Board
c/o City Manager
P.O. Box 447
Albany, Georgia 31702-0447

The form is available at the city's website www.albany.ga.us; at the information desk, city police department; and at each of the four police precincts.

Recommend to the police chief that the actions of the police officer were appropriate under the circumstances at issue.
(3)
Recommend to the police chief that the actions of the police officer were not appropriate under the circumstances at issue.

The approach taken by the civilian review board (or panel) may be to address the complainant and/or the officer at issue. Additionally, the civilian review board (or panel) may want to request the attendance of witnesses. The officer who is the subject of a complaint shall be expected to appear even if such officer is off duty at the time of such appearance. Such officer shall be paid his or her normal rate of compensation. The civilian review board recognizes the right of anyone to bring counsel with them and the civilian review board may make use of the services of the city attorney. If the matter is handled through an inquiry panel, then that panel shall upon completion of its work, make a report to the civilian review board.
