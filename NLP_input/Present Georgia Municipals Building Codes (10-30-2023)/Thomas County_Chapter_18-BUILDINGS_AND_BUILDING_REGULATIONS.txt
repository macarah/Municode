Method of calculation.
a.
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

d.
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 4)

(3)
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.

An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)

Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A* or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable.

Sec. 18-116. - Exemptions.

Sec. 18-118. - Credits.
When eligible, feepayors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section.
(1)
Credits; restrictions.
a.
Except as provided in subsection (2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article.
b.
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this article for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Thomas County, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area.
c.
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan.
(2)
Granting of credits.
a.
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that:
1.
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan;
2.
The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the Capital Improvements Element; and
3.
The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer.
b.
The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 18-119 of this article.
(3)
Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
a.
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
b.
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
c.
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Thomas County, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
d.
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
e.
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(4)
Credits; application.
a.
Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.
b.
The administrator, in his or her sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit.
c.
Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
(5)
Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 8)
Sec. 18-119. - Refunds.
(a)
Eligibility for a refund.
(1)
Upon the request of a feepayor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if:
a.
Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or
b.
The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected.
(2)
In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
(b)
Notice of entitlement to a refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Thomas County within 30 days after the expiration of the six year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication.
(c)
Filing a request for a refund. All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. Failure to make a claim for a refund within said time period shall result in a waiver of all claims to said funds.
(d)
Payment of refunds.
(1)
All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within 60 days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than 30 days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund.
(2)
A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected.
(3)
In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by Thomas County for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

(c)
Private agreements; procedure.
(1)
Any private agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the administrator for review, negotiation, and submission to the board of commissioners.

(2)
Amendment.

Redefine growth projections, land development assumptions, or goals or objectives that would affect system improvements proposed in the Capital Improvements Element;
b.
Add new public facility categories for impact fee funding, modify impact fee service areas or make changes to system improvement projects;
c.
Change service levels established for an existing impact fee service area; or
d.
Make any other revisions needed to keep the Capital Improvements Element up to date.
(c)
Continuation of validity. Failure of the board of commissioners to undertake a periodic review of the Capital Improvements Element shall result in the continued use and application of the latest adopted development impact fee schedule and other data. The failure to periodically review such data shall not invalidate this article.
(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 11)
Sec. 18-122. - Administrative appeals.
