Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Div. 1, §§ 2-161—2-169, and enacted a new Div. 1 as set out herein. The former Div. 1 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, §§ 1—3, 10, 9-6-01; Ord. No. 73-04, § 1, 10-7-04.
The effective date of this division is October 2005.

Sec. 2-161. - Policy statement.
The purpose of this program is to establish procedures for the administration of the Department of Transportation (DOT) anti-drug program pursuant to the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49 (49 CFR), Part 199. Part 199 requires operators of gas systems to have an anti-drug program for persons who perform on these facilities operating, maintenance, or emergency response functions covered by the DOT Pipeline Safety Standards in 49 CFR Part 192, 193 or 195. Testing under Part 199 is to be conducted prior to employment, after an accident, randomly and upon reasonable cause. Testing for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine will be performed.
As of August 21, 1990 (Part 199.1 (b)), any job applicant applying for a position covered in this program who refuses or fails a pre-employment drug test will not be hired. Any employee covered by this program who refused or fails a drug test will immediately be removed from the operating, maintenance or emergency response functions covered by the DOT Pipeline Standards in 49 CFR Part 192, 193 or 195. Any employee covered by this program that refuses or fails a drug test may receive disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
In addition, Part 199 requires each operator to provide an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP is to educate personnel about prohibited drugs, the policy against their use, and the assistance available, and to train supervisors in indications of drug use.
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-162. - Types of drug testing.
(a)
Pre-employment testing. A pre-employment drug test will be conducted before an individual is hired or transferred from another department for a covered gas position with the City of Cartersville. An applicant who tests positive does have the right to have their sample re-tested, at their own expense, with reimbursement by the city if such test is negative. City of Cartersville employees transferring into a position requiring drug testing who test positive also have the right to have their samples re-tested. Upon notification that a drug test is required, an employee or applicant will report no later than one-half (½) hour plus travel time after notification to the drug collection site and provide a specimen of urine.
(b)
Random testing. All employees working in a position covered by this program are subject to unannounced testing based on random selection. The operator of the gas system will test at a rate specified by Part 199 Pipeline Regulations of covered employees every twelve (12) months. Random testing will be done on a quarterly basis. Covered employees shall mean those employees performing duties and functions regulated by the Office of Pipeline Safety under Part 192, Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline. An employee or applicant will report no later than one-half (½) hour plus travel time after notification to the drug collection site and provide a specimen of urine.
Employees performing the following activities are not covered by this program: Performing accounting, payroll or clerical duties. The random selection procedure will be by computer based numbers that are matched with employee payroll identification numbers.
(c)
Post-accident testing. Employees working in positions covered by this program whose performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted, as a contributing factor to the accident will be tested. The employee will be tested as soon as possible, but not later than thirty-two (32) hours after the accident. Accident, in this instance, shall be defined as a reportable incident under Part 191.3 (see Appendix A for Accident Definition), Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety Related Conditions.
All reasonable steps will be taken to obtain a urine sample from an employee after an accident. In the case of conscious, but hospitalized employee, the operator shall request the hospital or medical facility to obtain the sample. If an employee is unconscious or otherwise unable to evidence consent to the procedure, the hospital or medical facility shall collect the sample. If an employee who is subject to post-accident testing is conscious, able to urinate normally (in the opinion of a medical professional), and refuses to be tested, that person shall be removed from duty as an employee.
(d)
Reasonable cause testing. An employee will be drug tested when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is using a prohibited drug. Examples of reasonable cause are; repeated errors on the job, regulatory or company rule violations, or unsatisfactory time and attendance patterns, if coupled with a specific event that indicated probable drug use. The decision to test must be substantiated by at least one (1) supervisor or the employee and that supervisor must be EAP trained in drug use symptoms.
(e)
Return to duty testing. An employee who, at the recommendation of the medical review officer, returns to work after drug rehabilitation, will be given unannounced drug tests. As scheduled by the medical review officer. These tests will continue for not less than one (1) year and not more than five (5) years. These tests are in addition to the other types of tests stated in this program.
(f)
Contract employees. Contractors who perform duties of a covered gas position on behalf of the City of Cartersville Gas System shall be required to participate in an approved contractor-sponsored drug program; or may, at the discretion of the gas superintendent, be allowed to participate in the Cartersville Gas System Program.
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)

• Records confirming that supervisors and employees have been trained as required by this policy will be made part of their permanent records. These records are to include copies of training materials.
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-166. - Confidentiality.
Each individual's record of testing and results under this chapter will be private and confidential. With the exception of the MRO, designated safety director, superintendent of gas system, assistant superintendent of the gas system, or upon request of RSPA or state agency officials as part of an accident investigation, the results of individual drug tests will not be released to anyone without the expressed written authorization of the individual tested. Prior to testing, the individual will be informed about who will receive the test data. All written records will be stored in locked files.
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-167. - Review and appeal.
Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-168. - Access to facilities and records.
The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including any test records. In addition, federal, state and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information as expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide to employee or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example, to workers' compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee.
Sec. 2-169. - Appendix A (Accident definition).
(1)
An event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of gas from an LNG facility; and
(a)

(3)
An event that is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though it did not meet the criteria of paragraphs (1) or (2).
(Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-170. - Urine Specimen Collection
Chapter 1—Collector: A collector is a trained individual who instructs and assists a donor at a collection site, and makes an initial inspection of the urine specimen provided by a donor, and initiates and completes the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF).
Any individual, who has received training in conducting the required collection procedure, may serve as a collector except in the following situations:
(a)
The direct supervisor of a particular employee you may not act as the collector when that employee is tested, unless is no feasible alternative; or
(b)
An individual working for an HHS-certified drug testing laboratory may not act as a collector if that individual can link the employee with the specimen drug test result or laboratory report (to allow such an individual to collect such a specimen would compromise the confidentiality of the employee's test result).
A collector should have appropriate identification. The collector is required to provide his or her identification (or collection company identification) if requested by the donor. There is no requirement for the collector to have a picture I.D. or to provide his or her driver's license with an address. Also, the collector is not required to provide any certification or other documentation to the donor proving the collector's training in the collection process.
Note: Although not required, it would benefit the collector to have the agency representative's name and telephone number to call if an unusual situation arises during the collection process.
Chapter 2—Collection site: A collection site is a facility (permanent or temporary) where a donor provides a specimen for a drug test.
A collection site must have:
(1)
A restroom/stall with a toilet for the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen. The presence of a toilet is not absolutely necessary when a single-use collection container is used that has sufficient capacity to contain the entire void. Whenever available, a single toilet restroom is preferred. All types of restrooms including a mobile facility (e.g., a vehicle with an enclosed toilet) are acceptable.
(2)
A source of water for washing hands that, if practical, is external to the restroom/stall where urination occurs. If a water source is not available, providing a moist towelette outside the restroom/stall is an acceptable alternative.
(3)
A suitable clean surface for the collector to use as a work area.
Note: The collector's work area must be located outside the restroom. However, if there is no appropriate space available outside the restroom to serve as a secure, clean work area and the restroom is large enough to accommodate a work area, the work area may be located inside the restroom as long as the donor has privacy while providing a urine specimen and the collector is the same gender as the donor.
(4)
Security features to prevent unauthorized access to the site during the collection.
(5)
Features to prevent the donor or anyone else from gaining unauthorized access to the collection materials/supplies. The collector must ensure that the donor does not have access to items that could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen (e.g., soap, disinfectants, cleaning agents, water).
(6)
Features to provide for the secure handling/storage of specimens from collection until shipment.
Chapter 3—Collection supplies: The following items must be available at the collection site to conduct proper collections:
(1)
Single-use plastic collection containers. Each collection container must be individually sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to easily catch and hold at least fifty-five (55) ml. urine, and have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of forty-five (45) ml. and above.
(2)
Single-use plastic specimen bottles. Each specimen bottle with cap must be sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to hold at least thirty-five (35) ml. (or they may be two (2) distinct sizes of specimen bottles providing that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least thirty-five (35) ml. of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least twenty (20) ml.), have screw-on or snap-on caps that prevent leakage, have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels (thirty (30) ml. for the primary specimen and fifteen (15) ml. for the split specimen) of urine to be poured into each bottle, be designed so that the required tamper-evident bottle label/seal on the CCF fits with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with chance that seal overlap would conceal printed information, and be leak resistant.
Note: Two (2) specimen bottles with caps may be sealed together using a single tamper-evident system (such as, shrink wrap) because two (2) specimen bottles are always needed for split specimen collections.
(3)
[Temperature strips.] Temperature strips capable of indicating temperature readings between 90E-100EF (or 32E-38EC). The temperature strips may either be affixed to the collection container as supplied or be affixed to the collection container after the donor gives the specimen collection container to the collector.
(4)
[Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms.] Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms (CCF) approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
(5)
Tamper-evident seals. Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). If this occurs, the collector should have a separate tamper-evident label/seal that can be used to seal the specimen bottle.
(6)
Leak-resistant plastic bags. The plastic bag must have two (2) sealable compartments or pouches (i.e., one (1) large enough to hold two (2) specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF).
(7)
Absorbent material. The absorbent material is placed with the specimen bottles inside the leak-resistant plastic bag in case a specimen bottle leaks during shipment.
Note: The use of absorbent material is required by the U.S. Postal Service and other express carriers when shipping biological materials.
(8)
Shipping containers. Boxes or bags that are used to transport specimens to the laboratory and can be securely sealed to prevent the possibility of undetected tampering. A shipping container/mailer is not necessary if a laboratory courier hand-delivers the sealed leak-resistant plastic bags containing the specimen bottles directly from the collection site to the laboratory.
(9)
Bluing agent. The bluing agent is added to the toilet bowl/water tank to prevent a donor from diluting the specimen.
(10)
Secure temporary location. If the sealed leak-resistant plastic bag containing the specimen bottles is not immediately placed in a shipping container, the sealed plastic bag must always be maintained within the line of sight of the collector to ensure that no one has access to the specimen until it is placed in a shipping container or it must be placed in a secured temporary location (e.g., inside a refrigerator that can be secured, inside a cabinet that can be secured). If the collector always places the sealed plastic bags immediately into shipping containers, there is no need to have a secure temporary location available at the collection site.
(11)
Disposable gloves. HHS recommends that collectors use single use disposable gloves while handling specimens. The occupational safety and health administration has specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who are exposed to potentially infectious body fluids (29 CFR Part 1910.1030).
Chapter 4—Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form All urine specimens must be collected using chain of custody. Chain of custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling and storage of a specimen from the time a donor gives the specimen to the collector to the final disposition of the specimen. For specimens collected under the Mandatory Guidelines, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection site. The CCF is available from a number of different sources (e.g., laboratories, collectors, MROs) although it is usually provided by the laboratory.
A sample of the CCF (OMB No. 0930-0158, Exp. Date: 6/30/2003) is on the SAMHSA web site (www.health.org/workpl.htm). All discussions throughout this revised handbook refer to this version of the CCF form.
The CCF consists of the following five (5) copies:
Copy 1. Laboratory copy.
Copy 2. Medical review officer copy.
Copy 3. Collector copy.
Copy 4. Employer copy.
Copy 5. Donor copy.
Copy 1 accompanies the specimen to the testing laboratory, Copy 2 is sent to the MRO, Copy 3 is retained by the collector, Copy 4 is sent to the employer, and Copy 5 is given to the donor.
The CCF is completed as follows:
Step 1 - This step is completed by the collector or employer representative. The employer name and address and the MRO name and address may be preprinted or handwritten. The collector will normally enter the donor's social security number after verifying the donor's identity. The collector also marks the appropriate box to indicate the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters information required for the collection site.
Step 2 - This step is completed by the collector after receiving the specimen from the donor and measuring the temperature of the specimen. This step requires the collector to mark the appropriate box to indicate if the temperature of the specimen was within the required temperature range; but also requires the collector to indicate whether it is a split specimen or single specimen collection, to indicate if no specimen was collected and why, or to indicate if it was an observed collection and why.
Step 3 - This step instructs the collector to seal the specimen bottle(s), have the donor initial the bottle seal(s), and then instruct the donor to complete step 5 on the MRO copy (Copy 2).
Step 4 - This step initiated by the collector and then completed by the laboratory after the specimen is accessioned by the laboratory. This step requires the collector to only sign the form once to certify that the specimen was collected, labeled, sealed, and released for shipment to the laboratory in accordance with federal requirements. The collector is also required to note the time of the collection, the date of the collection, and the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen is released for shipment to the laboratory.
Note: There is no requirement for couriers, express carriers, or postal service personnel to document chain of custody for the specimens during transit because they do not have access to the specimen(s) or the CCF. Chain of custody annotations resume when the shipping container/package is opened and an individual at the laboratory has access to the specimen bottle(s) and the CCF.
At the laboratory, the accessioner is required to document the condition of the primary specimen bottle seal, sign the CCF, print his/her name, record the date the specimen was accessioned, and indicate to whom the specimen was released. The entry for the "Specimen Bottle(s) Released To" may include transfer to temporary storage or transfer to another individual. After this transfer, chain of custody of the specimen bottle(s) is documented by the laboratory on an internal chain of custody form.
Step 5(a) - This step is completed by the laboratory to document the test results on the primary specimen.
Step 5(b) - This step is completed by the laboratory to report the split specimen result if the split specimen is tested.
The bottom area of Copy 1 is reserved for the tamper-evident specimen bottle seal(s). There must be two (2) labels (i.e., one (1) marked with the letter "A" to designate the primary specimen and the other marked with the letter "B" to designate the split specimen) to accommodate collecting split specimens and each must have the same preprinted specimen identification number that appears at the top of the CCF. Each label must also have a place for the collector to annotate the date of the collection and a place for the donor to initial each label after it is placed on the specimen bottle. If a single specimen collection procedure is used, the second label (i.e., the "B" label) is discarded by the collector.
Chapter 5—Donor identification: The donor must provide appropriate identification to the collector upon arrival at the collection site. Acceptable forms of identification include:
(1)
A photo identification (e.g., drivers license, employee badge).
(2)
Identification by an agency representative; or
(3)
Any other identification allowed under an agency's Workplace drug testing plan.
Unacceptable forms of identification include:
(1)
Identification by a co-worker;
(2)
Identification by another donor; or
(3)
Use of a single non-photo identification card (e.g., social security card, credit card, union or other membership cards, pay vouchers, voter registration card).
Chapter 6—Collection procedure: The following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the Mandatory Guidelines:
Step
(1)
The collector prepares the collection site to collect urine specimens. All collection supplies must be available, the area properly secured, water sources secured, and bluing agent placed in all toilets.
Note: If access to a water supply in the restroom cannot be controlled, the collector may tell the donor that he or she will be listening at the entrance to the restroom for any sounds associated with the donor attempting to use the available sources of water. Alternatively, the collector may enter the restroom with the donor if the collector is the same gender as the donor, but remains outside the toilet stall.
(2)
The collector begins the collection without delay after the donor arrives at the collection site.
Note: Do not wait because the donor is not ready, is unable to urinate, or an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.
(3)
The collector requests the donor to present an acceptable form of identification as described in Chapter 5.
Note: If the donor cannot satisfy the identification requirement, the collector may proceed with the collection if the donor can provide two (2) items of identification bearing his or her signature. After the donor signs the certification statement, the collector should compare the donor's signature with signatures on the identification that was presented. If the signatures match, the collector lists on the "Remarks" line the two (2) items of identification used to identify the donor and states that "signature identification was confirmed." The collector then continues with the collection process. If the signature does not match the signatures on the two (2) items of identification presented, the collector should state on the "Remarks" line that "signature identification is unconfirmed," discontinue the collection, and notify the collection site supervisor and the agency.
Note: In situations where the donor does not have either photo identification or two (2) other appropriate items of identification that could be used to verify identity and signature, this should not be automatically considered refusal to test. The collector should proceed with the collection. The collector should provide sufficient information on the "Remarks" line to help the MRO and the agency make a determination regarding the validity of the specimen and the collection process.
Note: If the donor asks the collector to provide identification, the collector must show the donor some form of identification. It must include the collector's name and the employer's name, address, and telephone number. It does not have to be a picture identification or include a home address and telephone number.
(4)
The collector reviews the instructions on the back of the CCF with the donor.
(5)
The collector begins entering information and/or ensures that the required information is provided at the top of the CCF (the laboratory name and address and a pre-printed specimen ID number) and in Step 1 of the CCF (employer's name, address, and I.D. number (if applicable), MRO name, address, phone and fax number, donor SSN or employee ID number, reason for test, drug test to be performed, collection site information).
Note: A specific MRO's name and address must appear on the form rather than the name of the clinic or medical facility.
(6)
The collector asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer clothing (e.g., coat, jacket, hat, etc.) and to leave any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings he or she is carrying with the outer clothing. The donor may retain his or her wallet.
Note: The donor must not be asked to remove other articles of clothing, such as, shirts, pants, dresses, or under garments. Additionally, the donor must not be requested or required to remove all clothing and wear a hospital or examination gown.
(7)
The collector directs the donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items to ensure that no items are present that could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the donor places the items back into the pockets and the collection procedure continues.
Note: If an item is found that appears to have been brought to the collection site with the intent to adulterate the specimen, a direct observed collection procedure is used. If the item appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site, secure the item and continue with the normal collection procedure.
(8)
The collector instructs the donor to wash and dry his or her hands, preferably under the collector's observation and must not wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to the collector.
Note: The donor must not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate/dilute the specimen.
(9)
The collector either gives the donor or allows the donor to select the collection container from the available supply. Either the collector or the donor, with both present, then unwraps or breaks the seal of the collection container.
Note: Do not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time.
Note: Do not allow the donor to take anything except the collection container into the room used for urination.
(10)
The collector directs the donor to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least forty-five (45) ml. (split specimen collection) or thirty (30) ml. (single specimen collection), not to flush the toilet, and return with the specimen as soon as possible after completing the void.
Note: The donor is always permitted to provide a specimen in private unless a direct observed collection has been authorized.
Note: Pay close attention to the donor during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to substitute or adulterate a specimen. If you detect such conduct, immediately begin a new direct observed collection using a second CCF. Provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the first CCF and submit it along with the specimen to the laboratory for testing. This will ensure that the laboratory knows that two (2) separate specimens are being submitted for testing; the first one (1) possibly being adulterated or substituted. Additionally, inform a supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so.
(11)
After the donor hands the specimen to the collector, the collector must measure the temperature of the specimen, check the specimen volume, and inspect the specimen for adulteration or substitution.
Temperature. Check the temperature of the specimen within four (4) minutes after the donor hands you the specimen. The acceptable temperature range is 32E-38EC/90E-100EF. Temperature is determined by reading the temperature strip originally affixed to or placed on the outside of the collection container after the donor hands you the specimen.
1.
If the temperature is within the acceptable range, the "Yes" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector proceeds with the collection procedure.
2.
If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, the "No" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector immediately begins a direct observed collection procedure using a second CCF. The original specimen is sealed and sent with the first CCF to the laboratory with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line to indicate that a direct observed specimen was also being collected and submitted to the laboratory.
Specimen volume. Check to make sure that the specimen contains a sufficient amount of urine (i.e., thirty (30) mL for a single specimen collection, forty-five (45) mL for a split specimen collection).
A.
Single specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable range.
1.
If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the same CCF for the second specimen, but must use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken.
2.
If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken.
Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
B.
Split specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range.
1.
If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the original CCF for the second specimen, but should use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen collection with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF.
2.
If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under the direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected.
If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume collected) with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF.
Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
C.
Split specimen collection. If the volume is between thirty (30) and forty-five (45) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range.
1.
If the temperature is in the acceptable range, all of the urine should be poured into one (1) specimen bottle (Bottle A). Bottle A is sent to the laboratory along with the CCF. The collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of a split specimen collection procedure.
2.
If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected.
If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second collection, the second specimen is submitted as a single specimen collection and the collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of split specimen collection procedure.
Note: HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
Adulteration or substitution. Inspect the specimen for unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material, or other signs of adulteration (e.g., if you notice any unusual odor). If it is apparent from this inspection that the donor has adulterated or substituted the specimen (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach), a second collection using direct observation procedures is conducted. The first specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation are both sent to the laboratory for testing. The first specimen is always sent to the laboratory even though it may have had an insufficient volume for either a single or split specimen collection.
If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs.
Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
Note: Under no circumstances is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids.
(12)
The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle.
Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected.
Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid.
(13)
The collector pours the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle label/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal.
Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s).
(14)
The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s).
Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the CCF label/seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle; however, a label/seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after several minutes the label/seal begins to lift off along the edges). The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used.
Note: If while sealing and initialing the CCF label/seal the collector or donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the collector must apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor. The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used.
Note: Since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamper-evident tape and does not have to be under the donor's direct observation, the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so.
(15)
The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers.
Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect. Otherwise, without the collector's comment, a CCF without the donor's signature could result in a canceled test. The same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the label(s).
(16)
The collector completes the chain of custody on the CCF (Step 4) by printing his or her name, signing where indicated, recording the date and time of the collection, and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottle(s) are being released.
(17)
The collector removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the donor. The donor may now leave the collection site.
Note: At this time, the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and over-the-counter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy (Copy 5) of the CCF, but not on any other copy. This information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the MRO.
(18)
The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal.
(19)
The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate.
Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container. The collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container.
Note: The collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible, the same day preferably.
(20)
The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector.
The collection procedure is now complete.
Chapter 7—Shy Bladder Procedure: When a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen, the donor may have intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site, could not provide a specimen as directed by the collector, has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a specimen, or has a "shy bladder." The term "shy bladder" usually refers to an individual who is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby during the attempted urination.
If a donor tells the collector, upon arrival at the collection site, that he or she cannot provide a specimen, the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless of the reason given.
At the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor unwrap/open a collection container, the does the following:
(1)
Requests the donor to try to provide a specimen.
Note: The donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container.
(2)
Directs the donor to drink some fluids.
Note: The donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
Note: The donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process.
Note: If the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine specimen, the collection procedure is discontinued and a "refusal to test" is noted on the "Remarks" line of the CCF.
(3)
Instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen. The collector uses the CCF from the first attempt.
Note: It is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one (1) additional attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts.
(4)
Maintains a record of the time of each attempt, whether there was no specimen provided or the quantity of specimen provided, and the total ounces of fluid given to the donor.
(5)
Discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was used for the void, but retains the CCF.
Note: If there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt, the collection container may be used for the next attempt.
(6)
Discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a potential "shy bladder" situation if after a period of three (3) hours (i.e., from the time the donor first demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen) the donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen.
(7)
Indicates "Shy Bladder" on the "Remarks" line of the CCF and attaches a copy of the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen. Copy 1 is discarded since no valid specimen was collected and the other copies of the CCF are distributed as appropriate.
If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs.
Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first.
Note: Under no circumstance is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids.
(8)
The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle.
Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected.
Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid.
(9)
The collector pours the specimen from the collection/container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal.
Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s).
(10)
The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s).
Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the CCF label/seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle; however, a label/seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after several minutes the label/seal begins to lift off along the edges). The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used.
Note: If while sealing and initialing the CCF label/seal the collector or donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the collector must apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor. The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used.
Note: Since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamper-evident tape and does not have to be under the donor's direct observation, the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so.
(11)
The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers.
Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect. Otherwise, without the collector's comment, a CCF without the donor's signature could result in a canceled test. The same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the label(s).
(12)
The collector completes the chain of custody on the CCF form (Step 4) by printing his or her name, signing where indicated, recording the date and time of the collection, and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottle(s) are being released.
(13)
The collector removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the donor. The donor may now leave the collection site.
Note: At this time, the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and over-the-counter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy (Copy 5) of the CCF, but not on any other copy. This information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the MRO.
(14)
The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal.
(15)
The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate.
Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container. The collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container.
Note: The collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible, the same day preferably.
(16)
The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector.
The collection procedure is now complete.
Chapter 8—Direct Observed Collection: A direct observed collection procedure is the same as a routine collection procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor urinate into the collection container.
The use of an observer may occur only when:
(1)
A previous drug test was reported either positive for a drug, dilute, adulterated, substituted, unsuitable for testing, or canceled because the split specimen was not tested;
(2)
The drug test is a return-to-duty or a follow-up test;
(3)
The agency/employer believes that the donor may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided; or
(4)
During a routine collection, the temperature of the specimen collected is outside the acceptable range, the collector observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct indicated a possible attempt to adulterate or substitute a specimen, or the collector believes that the specimen has been adulterated (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach).
Note: The observer must be the same gender as the donor even if the observer has a medical background/training.
The collector may serve as the observer when the collector is the same gender as the donor. If not, the collector must call upon another individual (who is the same gender as the donor) to act as the observer.
Note: With regard to chain of custody, the observer must never touch/handle the collection container.
After the donor has completed urinating into the collection container, the donor and observer leave the enclosed toilet stall/restroom and the donor hands the collection container directly to the collector.
Note: The observer must maintain visual contact of the collection container until the donor hands the container to the collector.
Note: If the observer and collector are one (1) and the same, the collector may receive the collection container from the donor while they are both in the enclosed toilet stall/restroom.
The collector continues with the collection procedure, checks the box for an observed collection in Step 2 on the CCF, and provides the name of the observer and the reason for an observed collection on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the CCF. A separate sheet explaining the use of an observed collection may be attached to the CCF if there is insufficient room on the "Remarks" line.
Chapter 9—Blind samples: Each federal agency is required to have some blind samples (negative and positive spiked samples) submitted along with the donor specimens.
The blind samples are either purchased by the agency and given to the collector or the collector, third party administrator, or MRO purchases the blind samples from a supplier and submits the blind samples along with agency's donor specimens.
A blind sample is always submitted using the same CCF as that used for a donor specimen. The collector provides the required information to ensure that the CCF has been properly completed as well as providing fictitious initials on the specimen bottle label/seal. Since there is no donor, the collector must indicate that the sample is a "blind sample" on the MRO copy where the donor would normally provide a signature (Step 5 on Copy 2 of the CCF).
Note: For a blind sample, Copy 5 of the CCF (the donor copy) may be discarded by the collector.
Note: If a federal agency/employer collects "split specimens" for its workplace drug testing program, the blind samples must also be submitted as "split specimens".
Chapter 10—Documentation errors/fatal flaws: When an HHS certified laboratory receives a specimen bottle(s) and its associated CCF, it checks to see if the specimen ID number on the specimen bottle label/seal matches the number on the CCF, that the specimen bottle seal is intact, and that the CCF has been properly completed by the collector. If there is any discrepancy and/or error of omission (e.g., the collector did not sign the chain of custody, the collector did not check one (1) of the specimen temperature boxes), the laboratory will contact the collector to determine if the discrepancy and/or missing information can be recovered. That is, the collector can provide a written memorandum attesting to the fact that he or she did actually carry out the required action but inadvertently forget to properly document the CCF.
Note: If a memorandum cannot be provided by the collector to recover the discrepancy or error of omission, the laboratory will report "Rejected for Testing" to the MRO and provide an appropriate comment as to why the specimen was not tested.
Note: Once contacted by the laboratory, the collector should immediately respond to the laboratory indicating whether it can or cannot provide a memorandum to recover the discrepancy and/or error of omission. HHS recommends that laboratories retain these specimens for a minimum of five (5) business days before they may be discarded.
Chapter 11—Regulated and non-regulated employers: Federal agencies and employers regulated by the department of transportation (DOT) are required to use the OMB approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form for their workplace drug testing programs. All other employers, private sector companies, states, department of justice programs, and the non-DOT testing conducted by DOT regulated employers are considered "non-regulated" with respect to complying with the HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs or the DOT Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs and are prohibited from using the Federal CCF.
In the rare instance where the collector, either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (e.g., post-accident test with insufficient time to obtain the CCF), uses a non-federal form for a regulated collection, the use of a non-federal form does, in and of itself, present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for the MRO to cancel the test. However, if the laboratory or the MRO discovers the use of the incorrect form, a signed statement must be obtained from the collector stating the reason why the Federal CCF was not used for the regulated collection.

DIVISION 2. - ALCOHOL MISUSE PREVENTION PROCEDURE[9]

Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Div. 2, §§ 2-181—2-193, and enacted a new Div. 2 as set out herein. The former Div. 2 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 4(Exh. D), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, §§ 4, 5, 9-6-01.
The effective date of this division is October 2005.

Sec. 2-181. - Purpose.
The purpose of this procedure is to reduce accidents that may result from the misuse of alcohol, thereby reducing fatalities, injuries, and property damage; and to comply with the alcohol testing standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-182. - Definitions.
Accident means an incident reportable under 49 CFR Part 191 involving gas pipeline facilities, which includes all parts of those physical facilities through which gas moves in transportation, including but not limited to pipe, valves, and other appurtenances attached to pipe, compressor units, metering stations, regulator stations, delivery stations, holders, and fabricated assemblies.
An incident on a gas pipeline is defined as follows;
(a)
An event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline and:
1.
A death or personal injury necessitating inpatient hospitalization; or
2.
Estimated property damage, including cost of gas lost, to the operator or others, or both of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or more.

Air blank means a reading by and evidential breath testing device (EBT) of ambient air containing no alcohol.
Alcohol use means the consumption of any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication, containing alcohol.
Breath alcohol technician (BAT) means an individual who is authorized to operate an EBT and has received appropriate training to do alcohol testing on the DOT course and the instrument being used.
Confirmation test means a second test, following a screening test with a result of 0.02 or greater that provides quantitative data of alcohol concentration.
Covered employee means a person who is an employee of the system, or who is an employee of a contractor engaged by the system and who performs work on a pipeline or an operation maintenance, or emergency-response function regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, as provided in 49 CFR Parts 192, 193, and 195.
Covered function (safety-sensitive function) means an operation, maintenance, or emergency-response function that is performed on a pipeline and is regulated by 49 CFR Parts 191 and 192.
Performing (a covered function) means an employee is considered to be performing a covered function (safety-sensitive function) during any period in which he or she is actually performing, is ready to perform, or is immediately available to perform such covered functions.
Refusal to submit (to an alcohol test) mean that a covered employee fails to provide an adequate breathing for testing without a valid medical explanation after receiving notice of the requirements to be tested or engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.
Safety director means the employee appointed by the city manager to oversee all functions of the Alcohol and Drug Programs of the City of Cartersville.
Screening test (or initial test) means an analytic procedure to determine whether an employee may have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in a breath specimen.
Substance abuse professional (SAP) means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy) or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission), with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol related disorders.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-183. - How to get help.
If you have any problem related to alcohol use or you suspect that a fellow employee has such a problem, notify your supervisor or the alcohol program manager, whose name is listed in Appendix A of this procedure.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-184. - Who must be tested.
As of January 1, 1996 any employee who would perform an operating, maintenance, or emergency response function on a pipeline is subject to alcohol testing under federal regulations. The persons holding any position listed in Appendix A of this procedure are considered covered employees and are subject to alcohol testing. An employee who prior to notification of testing for alcohol misuse that has notified his supervisor that he has an alcohol problem will not be allowed to perform the duties of a covered employee. The system at its discretion may send the employee to a substance abuse professional.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-185. - When testing must occur.
(a)
Alcohol testing must be performed on four (4) occasions:
(1)
When there has been an accident (post-accident testing).
(2)
When there is reasonable suspicion that one (1) or more alcohol-affected employees may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. (reasonable-suspicion testing).
(3)
When an employee returns to duty after engaging in prohibited conduct (return-to-duty testing).
(4)
Following the return to work of a covered employee who has received assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse (follow-up testing). The covered employee will be subject to a reasonable program of following-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return to duty.
(b)
The requirements for each type of testing are as follows:
(1)
Post-accident testing.
a.
Following an accident, as defined in the definition section of this procedure, the system will promptly test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance contributed to the accident.
b.
The decision not to administer an alcohol test under this section will be based on the system's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
c.
Each employee involved is required to submit to an alcohol test within two (2) hours of the accident. If a test is not administered within eight (8) hours following the accident, the system will stop trying to conduct an alcohol test and will prepare and keep on file a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted.
d.
An employee who is subject to post-accident testing and who fails to remain readily available for such testing—Including notifying his supervisor of his/her location if he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to an alcohol test—May be deemed to have refused to submit to testing.
e.
The employee must remain available for alcohol testing and may not consume any alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until the alcohol test has been conducted. Employees should, however, seek and obtain emergency medical care whenever necessary.
(1)
Reasonable-suspicion testing.
a.
Reasonable-suspicion testing is designed (in conjunction with supervisor training on the signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse) to identify alcohol-affected employees who may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. Employees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their safety or productivity. Supervisors will make a decision as to whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is using or has used alcohol.
b.
A determination by the system that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists and to require a covered employee to undergo an alcohol test will be based on specific, stated observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee at the time. The required observations will be made by a supervisor who has received at least sixty (60) minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse and will be documented.
c.
If a reasonable-suspicion test is not administered within two (2) hours following the determination, the System will prepare and keep on file a record stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered. If the required test is not administered within eight (8) hours of the determination, the system will stop trying to administer an alcohol test and will state in the record the reason for not administering the test. Upon request such records will be made available to any person who has been delegated authority in the matter concerned.
d.
The system will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse.
(3)
Return-to-duty testing.
a.
If a substance abuse professional consulted in the case makes a determination that some form of evaluation and/or treatment is required, then the employee must comply with the recommended provisions in order to be considered eligible to return-to-duty.
b.
Before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct, the system will ensure that the employee undergoes a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
(4)
Follow-up testing.
a.
Following the determination that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, the employee will be subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An employee who returns to duty will be subject to a reasonable program of follow-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return-to-duty.
b.
The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced alcohol follow-up tests during the first twelve (12) months following his or her return to duty. The SAP assigned may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing any time after the initial six (6) tests have been completed if the SAP makes the determination that such testing is no longer warranted.
c.
The system may require a covered employee to submit to alcohol follow-up testing when the SAP assigned has reason to suspect alcohol involvement.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-186. - Prohibited alcohol-related conduct.
The use or possession of alcoholic beverage(s) while on the system, or in any system vehicle, or on system time, including breaks or lunches, paid or unpaid, on any shift, is strictly prohibited.
(1)
Alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. Covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) greater (which means 0.04 grams or more of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath). If the system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
(2)
Pre-duty use within four (4) hours. Covered employees may not use alcohol within four (4) hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four (4) hours to performing covered functions or within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
(3)
On-duty use. Covered employees shall not use alcohol while performing covered functions. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered functions, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-187. - Penalty for not submitting to an alcohol test.
Any employee who refused to submit to a post-accident, reasonable-suspicion, or follow-up alcohol test shall not be permitted to perform covered functions or continue to perform covered functions and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-188. - Disciplinary actions for alcohol misuse.
(a)
A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater will be terminated. A covered employee who has violated the prohibitions on alcohol misuse and has been terminated will not be reconsidered for re-employment by the system for a period of one (1) year.
(b)
A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration greater that two hundredths (0.02) but less than four hundredths (0.04) will not be permitted to perform covered functions or continue to perform covered functions until:
(1)
An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than two hundredths (0.02); or
(2)
The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but no less than eight (8) hours following the determination that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions as contained in this procedure.
(c)
An employee who refuses to submit to an alcohol test without valid medical explanation after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance with the requirements of this procedure, or who engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing procedure, will be terminated from employment.
(d)
On duty or possession of alcohol on the systems time or premises will result in termination of employment.
(e)
When an employee has tested for alcohol in a concentration of two hundredths (0.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (0.04), that employee will be removed from performing any covered function and suspended without pay for the remainder of his or her shift.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-189. - Review and appeal.
Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have a chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-190. - Where alcohol tests will be performed.
All alcohol testing for the system will be performed by the entity designated in appendix A of the procedure.

(f)
The system will make records available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of the written request from any covered employee. Disclosure by the subsequent employer is permitted only as expressly authorized by the terms of the employee's written request.
(g)
The system may disclose required information pertaining to a covered employee to the employee or the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual, and arising from the results of an alcohol test administered as required by this procedure and the regulations set forth in 49 CFR Parts 199 or 40 or from the system's determination that the covered employee engaged in prohibited alcohol-related conduct including but not limited to, a worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding relating to a benefit sought by the employee.
(h)
The system will release information regarding covered employee's record as directed by the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information to an identified person.

Sec. 2-193. - Alcohol testing.
Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests.
§ 40.241. What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test?
As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using:
a)
When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test.
b)
Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.
1.
If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins.
2.
If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test.
c)
Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee.
d)
If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number.
e)
Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF.
f)
Complete Step 1 of the ATF.
g)
Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.
Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests.
§ 40.25. What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD?
a)
As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD:
1.
Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date.
2.
Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee.
3.
Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer.
4.
If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test.
5.
When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated.
6.
(i)
If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device.
(ii)
The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test.
(iii)
You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.)
(iv)
You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted.
(v)
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF.
(vi)
You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test.
7.
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)—(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test.
8.
You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF.
9.
You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing.
10.
You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF.
(b)
As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the breath tube ASD:
1.
Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You must not use the device after its expiration date.
2.
Remove a device from the package and break the tube's ampule in the presence of the employee.
3.
Secure an inflation bag onto the appropriate end of the device, as directed by the manufacturer on the device's instructions.
4.
Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee chooses to use (e.g., hold) the device, instruct the employee to blow forcefully and steadily into the blowing end of device until the inflation bag fills with air (approximately twelve (12) seconds).
5.
If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
6.
When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear.
7.
(i)
If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one.
(ii)
The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test.
(iii)
You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.)
(iv)
You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted.
(v)
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF.
(vi)
You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using another type of ASD (e.g., saliva device) or an EBT.
8.
If you were able to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section, you must compare the color of the crystals in the device with the colored crystals on the manufacturer-produced control tube no sooner than the manufacturer instructs. In all cases color comparisons must take place within fifteen (15) minutes of the test.
9.
You must follow the manufacturer's instructions for determining the result of the test. You must then show both the device and the control tube side-by-side to the employee and record the result on the ATF.
10.
You must never re-use devices or gloves used in breath tube testing. The inflation bag must be voided of air following removal from a device. One (1) inflation bag can be used for up to ten (10) breath tube tests.
11.
You must note the fact that you used a breath tube device in Step 3 of the ATF. {67 FR 61522, Oct. 1, 2002}
