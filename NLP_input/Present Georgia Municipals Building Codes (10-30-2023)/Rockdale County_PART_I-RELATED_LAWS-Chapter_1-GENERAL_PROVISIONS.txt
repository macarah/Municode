Chapter 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Part I of this volume is a compilation of local laws involving the county adopted by the Georgia General Assembly or adopted under home rule by the county along with state constitutional amendments and general laws of local application (population acts) to the county only. No state laws of general application are reprinted here but references to those laws are occasionally included in appropriate places.
The material included in this part has been arranged according to subject matter. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added to clarify the meaning of the text. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic act and amendatory acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. There is a Related Laws Comparative Table listing chronologically the laws in this part and their location in this part.
A uniform system of citations to state statutes has been used.
