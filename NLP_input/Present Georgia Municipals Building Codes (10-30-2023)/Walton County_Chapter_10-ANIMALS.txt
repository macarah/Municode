Sec. 10-56. - Procedures for classifying vicious dogs and dangerous dogs; notice; hearing.
(a)
Duty to investigate. Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within the animal control officer's jurisdiction, the animal control officer shall make such investigations as necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog.
(b)
Impoundment. If the animal control officer believes that a dog subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog poses a threat to public safety, the dog may be immediately impounded and the dog owner shall be responsible for all costs resulting from such impoundment. At the discretion of the animal control officer, the dog may be held at an approved veterinary or boarding facility at the owner's expense. Any impounded dog may be held until the requirements for possessing a classified dog as contained in section 10-57 are met or until a hearing in probate court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section results in a decision that no classification is warranted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the animal control officer states his or her intention to pursue a civil action in superior court to request euthanasia of the dog pursuant to subsection (g), (i), or (j) of this section within ten days of mailing the notice provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the dog may be held at the owner's expense through the final adjudication of said civil action.
(c)
Notice. When the animal control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the animal control officer shall mail a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours. Such notice shall include a summary of the animal control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing before the probate court on the animal control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the animal control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. If an owner cannot be located within ten days of an animal control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the animal control officer.
(d)
Hearing. When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the probate court for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the probate court shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the probate court conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's determination. The animal control officer may, in his discretion, impound said dog in the county shelter pending the outcome of said probate court proceedings.
(e)
Notice of determination by probate court. Within ten days after the hearing, the probate court shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur.
(f)
Judicial review. Judicial review of the probate court's final decision shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 5-3-2 and costs shall be paid as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-22.
(g)
The probate court, either upon a hearing requested by the owner of a dog regarding a classification determination made by the animal control officer or upon a hearing requested by an animal control officer, may order the euthanasia of a dog upon finding, after notice and hearing, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article and:
(1)
The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or
(2)
Any local government authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting euthanasia of the dog.
(h)
Where the probate court finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing as provided by this article, a dog to have caused a serious injury to a human on more than one occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection;
(i)
Where the probate court, after notice and hearing as provided by this article, (1) upholds a determination that a dog is vicious or dangerous and (2) determines, based on the facts and circumstances of the case, that the requirements set forth in this article for possessing such a classified dog are insufficient to protect the public from said dog, the probate court may, in its discretion, order said dog to be euthanized.
(j)
Where the probate court, upon application of the animal control officer and after notice and hearing as provided by this article, determines, based upon the facts and circumstances of the case, that the requirements set forth in this article for owning or possessing a classified dog are insufficient to protect the public from a dog determined to be dangerous or vicious, the probate court may, in its discretion, order said dog to be euthanized.
