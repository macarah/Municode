Sec. 16-3. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other developments which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. of 6-20-1991, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 16-4. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage.
(Ord. of 6-20-1991, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 16-5. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(7)
To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. of 6-20-1991, art. 1, § D)
Sec. 16-6. - Lands to which these provisions apply.
