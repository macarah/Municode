Secs. 12-25—12-51. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION

Sec. 12-52. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The Drastic methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.)
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the state department of natural resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for the city are typified by those of the coastal plain. In the coastal plain, the significant recharge areas are the surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridan, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(1), § 3)
Sec. 12-53. - Findings of fact; objectives.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by the infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(b)
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
To protect groundwater quality by limiting the density of development; and
(3)
To protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse affect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(1), § 1)
Sec. 12-54. - Variances.
A variance may be approved if such approval is not contrary to the public interest and where because of the special characteristics of the property and the activity, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. However, the spirit of this article must be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided that the variance, if granted, will not result in damage to the groundwater.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(1), § 5)
Sec. 12-55. - Appeals.
Any aggrieved party may appeal a decision by the enforcement officer under this article according to the appeal process established under the city's zoning ordinance.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(1), § 6)
Sec. 12-56. - Groundwater recharge area district established.
(a)
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the state department of natural resources in the Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition.
(b)
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this section.

ARTICLE IV. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 12-88. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including:
(1)
Storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater;
(2)
Protection of water quality and reduction of erosion;
(3)
Habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species;
(4)
Food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries;
(5)
Educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and
(6)
Scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.
General wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map.
Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the state soil conservation service.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. The term "wetlands" includes swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or any authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation."
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(2), § 2)
Sec. 12-89. - Findings of fact; purpose.
(a)
The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature.
(1)
Wetlands provide:
a.
Habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation;
b.
Water quality maintenance and pollution control;
c.
Flood control;
d.
Erosion control;
e.
Natural resource education;
f.
Scientific study;
g.
Open space; and
h.
Recreational opportunities.
In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavation, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(3)
The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of 1989 Georgia Laws page 1317, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder.
(b)
The purposes of this article are to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. The objective of this article is to make the public aware of state and federal laws that protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(2), § 1)
Sec. 12-90. - Wetland protection district established.
(a)
This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined in this section and located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of the ordinance from which this article is derived, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city.
(b)
The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdiction wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 2-12-2001(2), § 3)
Sec. 12-91. - Local development permitting.
(a)
Requirements. No regulated activity will be conducted within the wetland protection district without prior review by the city zoning administrator. Proposed activities shall be reviewed to compare proposals for land disturbance or development with the generalized wetlands map to determine whether local permitting should proceed or be deferred pending a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) of this section shall be prohibited without the prior issuance of a local permit.
(1)
Issuance of local permit. A local permit shall be issued without a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if either one of the following two conditions exist:
a.
It is not the type of activity that would cause the alteration of wetlands; or
b.
The proposed location of the activity is not near or within a protected wetland boundary as shown on the generalized wetlands map adopted by the city as a part of this article.
(2)
Deferment of local permit. Issuance of a local permit shall be deferred pending a jurisdictional wetlands determination by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This determination is required when a proposed activity is of a type that would cause alteration of wetlands and the proposed location of the activity is near or within a wetland boundary. A deferred local permit will be issued after a letter of permission or section 404 permit is obtained from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by the applicant.
(b)
Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided in this article:
(1)
Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or United States in such a way that would require an individual section 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(4)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with the best management practices approved by the state forestry commission.
(5)

(7)
Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
(8)
Emergency repair of critical facilities. Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and that, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the city or its designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
a.
Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provide that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected.
b.
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration, or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of this subsection (b).
c.
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures; provided that they are built on pilings to allow the unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(c)
