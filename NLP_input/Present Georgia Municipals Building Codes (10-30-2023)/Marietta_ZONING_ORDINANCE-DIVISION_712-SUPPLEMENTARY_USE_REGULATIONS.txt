712.01 - Special land use permits.
A.
Within each zoning district's standards, certain property uses may be allowed provided they obtain a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) from City Council. This additional review is necessary due to the increased possibility that such uses may have a negative impact on surrounding properties and their value. The City retains its right to subject certain uses to greater scrutiny to determine if they are appropriate or if additional safeguards may mitigate potentially harmful effects on neighboring properties. Table B below denotes those uses which are permitted only after issuance of a Special Land Use Permit, permitted zoning districts and issuing entity.

Cross reference— Special land use permit necessary, § 704.06.
712.02 - Community residences.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Fair Housing Amendment Act (1988) states that local zoning regulations may not prohibit community residences and requires that municipalities provide "reasonable accommodation" of such uses. The City of Marietta regulates community residences using criteria based upon the actual use of the facility and the number of individuals utilizing its services. This provides individuals with opportunities for normalization instead of institutionalization thereby reducing social costs and fostering personal growth and responsibility while also allowing the City to maintain viable neighborhoods based primarily upon similar single family or planned multi family dwellings.
B.
Group Homes. Group homes are defined throughout the entirety of this section as dwellings shared by individuals who live together as a single housekeeping unit and in a long-term family-like environment in which staff persons provide care, education and participation in community activities for the residents with the primary goal of enabling the residents to live as independently as possible in order to reach their maximum potential. This use shall also apply to homes for the handicapped; however, the term "handicapped" shall not include current illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance or alcohol, nor shall it include any person whose residency in the home would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals. The term "group home for the handicapped" shall not include alcohol or drug treatment centers, work release facilities for convicts or ex-convicts, or other housing serving as an alternative to incarceration.
1.
Group homes with 3 or fewer residents, exclusive of resident staff, are permitted uses within the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RA-4, RA-6, RA-8, and PRD-SF zoning districts, provided:
a)
The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code including minimum dwelling space requirements.
b)
The operator of the group home obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing body.
c)
No other such facility or halfway house is located within 1,000 feet as measured from property line to property line.
2.
Group homes with more than 3 residents, exclusive of resident staff, may be permitted within the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RA-4, RA-6, RA-8, and PRD-SF zoning districts only if granted a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) after a public hearing before City Council.
3.
Group homes are considered permitted uses by right in RM and RHR zoning districts, subject to those standards set forth therein.
C.
Halfway Houses. Halfway houses are temporary residential living arrangements for persons leaving an institutional setting and in need of a supportive living arrangement in order to readjust to living outside the institution. These are persons who are receiving therapy and counseling from support staff who are present when residents are present, for the following purposes:
•
To help them recuperate from the effects of drug or alcohol addiction;
•
To help them reenter society while housed under supervision or while under the constraints of alternatives to imprisonment including, but not limited to, prerelease, work release, or probationary programs; or
•
To help persons with family or school adjustment problems that require specialized attention and care in order to achieve personal independence.
1.
Halfway houses may be permitted within OI, RM, and RHR zoning districts only if granted a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) from City Council and are limited to 1 bed per 250 gross square feet of heated building space.
a)
The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code including minimum dwelling space requirements.
b)
The operator obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing body.
c)
No other such facility is located within 1,000 feet as measured from property line to property line.
(Ord. No. 7513, 1/12/2011, § 5; Ord. No. 7881, 6/8/2016, §§ 8, 9; Ord. No. 7961, 6/14/2017, § 13; Ord. No. 8229 , 7/14/2021, § 1)
712.03 - Extended stay facilities.
A.
"Extended stay hotels or motels" shall be defined as any hotel or motel in which 50% or greater of all guest rooms have facilities for both the storage, refrigeration, and preparation of food, and/or which are advertised, designed, or utilized for weekly or monthly occupancy.
B.
A special land use permit must be obtained for the construction and operation of extended stay hotels and motels and may only be permitted in OS, OHR, and RRC zoning districts; furthermore, extended stay hotels and motels shall comply with the following restrictions:
1.
All guest rooms which have facilities for both the storage and preparation of food and have less than 300 square feet of floor area are limited to a maximum of 2 persons per such room; however, for all such guest rooms greater than 300 square feet, one additional person shall be allowable per each additional 75 square feet of floor area up to and including a maximum of 4 persons.
2.
Minimum lot size for extended stay hotels is 2 acres.
3.
No more than 10% of individual guests shall register, reside in, or occupy any room or rooms within the same licensed facility for more than a 90-day period.
[3.1]
An indoor or fenced outdoor active recreation area shall be provided. The size of each recreation area shall be calculated at a ratio of 5 square feet per room with a minimum provision of 750 square feet. All recreation areas must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Director prior to development to ensure that all applicable safety specifications and standards are met.
4.
No permanent business license shall be issued for the conduct of any business from any guest room of the facility.
5.
No hotel or motel under this section is to be converted to or used as an apartment or condominium without prior approval of City Council. Any hotel or motel converted to such use must meet all applicable state and local codes including zoning standards.
6.
No hotel or motel or other structure can be converted to an extended stay facility without meeting all of the rules and regulations contained within Section 712.03 and must obtain a special land use permit from City Council, as mentioned in Section 712.01.
7.
Extended stay hotels/motels must have a landscape plan submitted, approved, and constructed prior to issuance of a business license.
8.
Extended stay hotels/motels must have a minimum of 25% of the lot area dedicated to either active or passive open space. The open space shall include active recreation, such as a children's playground area, and/or passive recreation, such as greenspace and walking paths.
9.
Each guest room must be protected with a sprinkler system approved by the fire marshal or their designee.
10.
Each guest room having a stove-top unit or other type burner unit shall be required to also include a maximum 60 minute automatic power off timer for each such unit.
11.
A hard-wired smoke detector shall be provided and installed in each guest room.
12.
No outside storage or permanent parking of equipment or vehicles shall be allowed.
13.

14.
No building may be placed within 300 feet of any residentially zoned property, inclusive of the required buffer.
15.
These restrictions shall apply to all facilities permitted or expanded after September 8, 2004.
16.
All extended stay facilities shall have a maximum density of 75 guest units per gross acre of development.
(Ord. No. 6728, 9/8/2004, § 5)
712.04 - Home occupations.
A.
Intent and Purpose. Certain occupational uses termed "home occupations" are allowed in dwelling units on the basis that such uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence. They have special regulations that apply to ensure that home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the residential use and the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood and, as such, may be permitted provided such uses:
1.
Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence;
2.
Are conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal practitioner;
3.
Are compatible with residential uses;
4.
Are limited in extent and do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood.
B.
Definition of Accessory Home Occupations. There are 2 types of home occupations, Type A and Type B. Permit requirements and uses allowed in each type vary and are allowed only if they comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance. Deviation from any standard requires a variance approval from City Council.
1.
In Type A home occupations resident(s) use their home as a place of work, home office or business mailing address. Employees or customers are prohibited from coming to the site. Examples include artists, crafts people, writers and consultants.
2.
In Type B home occupations resident(s) use their home for work, home office or business mailing address which requires or results in either an employee or consultant or agent or subcontractor or customer coming to the site. Examples are counseling, tutoring, and certain office uses. Type B home occupations must obtain a special land use permit from City Council due to their greater possible impact on the surrounding neighborhood as a result of individuals and visitors from outside the neighborhood coming to the property.
C.
General Provisions and Prohibited Uses. All home occupations shall meet the following:
1.
A home occupation shall be incidental and accessory to the use of a dwelling as a residence. No more than 750 square feet, 25% of the floor space of the dwelling unit, whichever is less (including attached garages), may be used for the occupation.
2.
There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation or alteration of the residence and/or accessory buildings to accommodate the home occupation. Internal or external changes which will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. Any alteration or addition which expands the floor area of the principal structure dedicated to the home occupation use shall void the existing business license and require a new business license be obtained, subject to property compliance verification by the Department of Development Services. For Type B home occupations a new public hearing must be held for the rights associated with the special land use permit to be reestablished.
3.
There shall be no outside operations or exterior storage of inventory or materials to be used in conjunction with a home occupation.
4.
Off-site employees of the resident shall not congregate on the premises for any purpose concerning the home occupation nor park their personal vehicles at the location.
5.
No article, product or service used or sold in connection with such activity shall be other than those normally found on the premises.
6.
No more than 1 vehicle associated with the home occupation may be parked at the site. Such vehicle is limited to 1½-ton carrying capacity and must be used exclusively by the resident and parked on a valid improved surface.
7.
No use or activity may create noise, dust, glare, vibration, smoke, smell, electrical interference or any fire hazard.
8.
All home occupations shall be subject to periodic inspections by the Department of Development Services.
9.
Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines (such as autos, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws and other small engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited.
10.
Group instruction, assembly or activity shall be prohibited.
11.
Accessory home occupations may not serve as headquarters or dispatch centers where employees come to the site and are dispatched to other locations.
12.
The Department of Development Services must approve all business licenses which shall be recertified annually.
D.
Specific Criteria for Type A Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C., Type A home occupations are subject to the following restrictions:
1.
No clients, nonresident employees or customers are allowed on the premises.
2.
Pickups from and deliveries to the site in regard to the business shall be restricted to vehicles which have no more than 2 axles and shall be restricted to no more than 2 pickups or deliveries per day between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
3.
No signage regarding the home occupation is permitted on the property.
4.
No advertisement shall be placed in any media (including flyers soliciting business) containing the address of the property.
E.
Specific Criteria for Type B Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C., Type B home occupations are subject to the following restrictions:
1.
A Special Land Use Permit must be obtained from City Council following a public hearing, which shall follow the same procedures and fees set forth in Division 720. City Council shall consider the desires of the immediate neighborhood, the nature of the proposed business, the availability of parking, traffic generation and any other issue that may detract from the residential character of the area and property values.
2.
No Type B home occupation may be established in districts zoned for multifamily residential purposes.
3.
No more than one Type B home occupation per dwelling is permitted.
4.
Uses that may be permitted as Type B home occupations include those in which only the occupants of the dwelling and 1 additional employee or consultant or agent or subcontractor shall be authorized to work on the premises. Visitation by clients in conjunction with a home occupation shall be limited to 2 per week; provided however, that the following exception is made for purposes of meeting overriding public goals of education:
Tutoring or the instruction of music, dance, arts and crafts and similar subjects, limited to 2 students in home at 1 time.
5.
The following uses are specifically prohibited as Type B home occupations (list not all-inclusive): auto sales or auto repair; restaurants or any preparation of food or drink; animal hospitals; veterinary clinics; kennels or the keeping of animals; funeral homes; retail or wholesale shops; personal service establishments; special events facilities; lodging services; or day care.
6.
Customers may visit the site only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
7.
The applicant for any proposed Type B home occupation must provide city staff with a copy of the most recent recorded protective covenants applicable to the subject property. The applicant must submit a copy of the request to the homeowner's association, if any, and must provide a copy of the response, if any, to the city staff. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to show that the proposed use is allowed by the protective covenants; and
8.
If the proposed use clearly violates the subdivision covenants, staff shall have the authority to deny the application. The applicant may appeal the denial to City Council at the next regularly scheduled meeting, but such an appeal shall not require a public hearing. If Staff's decision is affirmed by City Council, the matter shall be concluded. If City Council reverses staff's decision, the matter would be placed on a subsequent City Council agenda for a full public hearing.
(Ord. No. 7032, 4/11/2007, § 2; Ord. No. 7119, 12/12/2007, § 1)
712.05 - AICUZ, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Overlay District.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Overlay District is established to contribute to the safe operation of Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), to facilitate orderly development around the airfield, to protect property values, and to control and minimize noise and potential accident impacts on the surrounding areas of the City of Marietta. The AICUZ Overlay District promotes development patterns which are appropriate for the airfield vicinity and protect the public's safety and welfare by limiting land uses near the airport which require or generate large concentrations of individuals. The boundaries, recommendations and regulations contained herein are taken directly from studies conducted at Dobbins ARB by the United States Air Force, and specifically the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study for Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia, dated October 2011 (hereby referenced and on file in the City Clerk's office).
For all proposed development(s) and/or redevelopment(s) within any zone of the AICUZ Overlay District, the Director of the Department of Development Services, or his designee, shall be responsible for determining whether a particular use is compatible within a specific zone. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have jurisdiction to hear any appeal of a decision or determination made by the Director, or his designee.
B.
Applicability.
1.
Properties subject to the AICUZ Overlay District shall be referenced on maps maintained by the Marietta Department of Development Services.
2.
The AICUZ Overlay District regulates and recommends uses for the affected properties within the accident potential and noise zones, which were determined by the 2011 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Dobbins ARB and shall be considered complementary of any other zoning district standards.
3.
Properties located within the AICUZ Overlay District, which were developed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, are considered "grandfathered" and fully protected from new or revised AICUZ regulations that were not in effect prior to that date. This "grandfathered" status conveys upon such properties the right to construct or reconstruct a building on the same building footprint, or to make structural alterations to the existing building, as long as neither the area nor the height of the building is increased. All other City Codes, including, but not limited to, building, fire, zoning and other development standards would be required to be met.
4.
Properties located within the AICUZ Overlay District that are proposed for development after the adoption of this ordinance are subject to the rules set by this section. For the purpose of this section, "development" shall be defined as follows:
a)
The construction, reconstruction, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any buildings;
b)
Any clearing, grading, or other movement of land for which permission is required.
5.
The Department of Development Services shall notify any person submitting an application for a building permit, rezoning, special land use permit or variance, or any other permit issued by the City of Marietta, if the property in question is within the AICUZ Overlay District.
6.
However, no development shall be permitted in any portion of the AICUZ Overlay District that may:
a)
Involve fire or explosive, toxic, corrosive or other hazardous materials.
b)
Release any air-borne substances such as steam, dust, and smoke, which would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with the operation of aircraft.
c)
Produce light emissions, which would either directly or indirectly (reflective) interfere with pilot vision.
d)
Produce electrical emissions which would interfere with aircraft communications systems or navigational equipment.
e)
Be designed so as to attract birds or waterfowl.
C.
Accident Potential and Noise Zones Three primary determinants are used in promoting compatibility between the airfield and nearby areas: accident potential to land users, hazards to operations from land uses (height, obstructions, etc.), and aircraft noise. The AICUZ Overlay District establishes use restrictions, recommended noise reduction measures, and height limitations as necessary to produce compatible land uses in each of these areas.
1.
Clear Zones (CZ): This is an area starting at the end of the runway and extending outward 3,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width), presenting the greatest accident risk of all the designated accident potential zones; thereby, extra protection is required. CZ includes all lands encompassed within the area designated CZ on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta. The placing of structures, buildings, or electric transmission lines located above ground in the clear zones is subject to FAA review and approval.
2.
Accident Potential I Zones (APZ I): This is an area extending outward from the CZ an additional 5,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width) presenting a risk of aircraft accident less than the CZ but greater than APZ II; thereby, extra protection is required. APZ I includes all land encompassed within the area designated APZ I on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta.
3.
Accident Potential II Zones (APZ II): This is an area extending outward from APZ I an additional 7,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width) presenting a risk of accident less than both the CZ and APZ I, but a measurable risk nonetheless; thereby, extra protection is required. APZ II includes all lands encompassed within the area designated APZ II on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta.
4.
Noise Zones: The noise environment of the AICUZ Overlay District is depicted as contours with day-night sound levels (DNL) in excess of 65 decibels. Land use guidelines are based on the compatibility of various land uses with the listed noise exposure ranges. (All AICUZ Overlay District noise guidelines are on file in the City Clerk's office, in the "Guidelines for Construction in Marietta's AICUZ Overlay District.")
D.
Permitted Uses The AICUZ Overlay District establishes use restrictions, recommended noise reduction measures, and height limitations, as necessary, to produce compatible land uses in each of the 3 accident potential and noise zones identified above (see recommended land uses in Section 3.4, Land Use Compatibility Guideline and Table 3-1 of the 2011 Air Institution Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study). No new or proposed development (as defined in Subsection 712.05B.4.) shall be approved unless in accordance with the requirements of this section and those of the underlying zoning classification, except as otherwise approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals (see Subsection 712.05F.).
E.
Height Restrictions. Height restrictions are necessary to ensure that buildings and structures in the vicinity of Dobbins will not impair flight safety. A series of imaginary surfaces surrounding the airfield is defined by the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, "Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace." Any object or structure which would penetrate any of these imaginary surfaces is considered by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to be an obstruction to air navigation. Appendix D of the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Dobbins ARB (October 2011) provides detailed criteria for determining whether an object or structure constitutes an obstruction.
F.
Permits. Any building permit submitted for properties within the AICUZ Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Department of Development Services to determine whether it meets the standards set forth in this section. Those applications which do not meet these criteria shall be required to seek a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals (see paragraph G).
1.
No permit shall be granted by the city that would allow the establishment of a flight hazard not authorized by this section or permit a non-conforming structure, or natural growth to become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation or become less compatible than it was on the effective date of this section.
2.
Before any existing structure within any portion of the AICUZ Overlay District may be altered in such a manner as to increase its base height, a letter from Dobbins Air Reserve Base is required. The letter should state that Dobbins ARB does not object to the violation of the height limit.
3.
No new or proposed development, as defined in Subsection 712.05B.4., shall be approved unless in accordance with the requirements of this section and those of the underlying zoning classification. Conflicts between uses permitted in the underlying zoning classification, but not recommended by the Land Use Compatibility Guidelines (Section 3.4, Land Use Compatibility Guideline and Table 3-1 of the 2011 Air Institution Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study), may be reconciled by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
G.
Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure, increase the height of any structure, permit natural growth, or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section may apply for a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals. Said application must include an official response from the Commander of Dobbins ARB, or his designee, which sets forth the facility's recommendation as to the variance request.
(Ord. No. 7664, 6/12/2013, § 1)
712.06 - Adult establishments.
A.
Adult establishments are subject to the regulations in Marietta Municipal Code Chapter 8-20-190.
B.
It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated an adult establishment within the central business district of the city per map on file with the Planning and Zoning Office, within the Downtown Marietta Historic District per map on file with the Planning and Zoning Office, or within any zoning category other than Community Retail Commercial (CRC), Regional Retail Commercial (RRC), Light Industrial (LI), or Heavy Industrial (HI) per the Official Zoning Map.
(Ord. No. 8302 , 9/14/2022, § 10)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 8302 , § 10, adopted Sept. 14, 2022, amended the title of § 712.06 to read as herein set out. The former § 712.06 title pertained to adult entertainment.
712.07 - Telecommunication towers and infrastructure.
Telecommunication towers may be permitted in RRC, CRC, HI, LI, OS, OHR and CBD zoning districts pursuant to those additional restrictions listed herein.
A.
General Requirements.
1.
A Special Land Use Permit granted by City Council shall be required for the construction of all new telecommunications towers within the City limits after the following factors are considered:

3.
Tree loss on any nonexempt parcel shall not be considered an exemption from this section. Trees shall not be removed without prior authorization of the Department of Development Services staff, unless loss occurred due to sudden weather conditions which create an imminent hazard condition. Dead, dying, diseased, infested or otherwise hazardous trees may be removed only after a Notification of Tree Removal form has been submitted and the condition of the tree(s) is verified by City staff prior to removal. A decision on the Notification of Tree Removal shall be issued as soon as possible but no later than 10 business days from receipt of all required documents. The following procedures shall be observed:
a)
If the location of the tree(s) satisfies a specific requirement, such as trees required in vehicle use areas or buffers, trees must be replaced in such a way as to meet the minimum standards for that requirement. If this cannot be achieved, all such variance requests must be submitted to City Council for consideration.
b)
If the removed tree satisfies the site density factor (SDF) only and not a specific location requirement, the following options are available:
1)
Replace the tree(s) with a tree of equal size; however a 3-inch caliper tree shall be the maximum diameter tree required to be planted, regardless of the size of the tree removed. Replacement trees must be appropriate for the location on the site according to the approved species list. NOTE—This option is only available if a Notification of Tree Removal has been submitted and approved prior to the tree's removal.
2)
Provide a tree survey, complete with density calculations, for the entire site. If the density remaining on the site after the removal does not meet the minimum SDF, replacement will be necessary.
3)
Payment into the City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund according to Section 712.08(M) for the loss in the removed tree's density.
4.
The Site Density Factor (SDF) is the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (see Table D). This density requirement must be achieved whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The required unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two.

  c)
For additions to existing projects, the tree density requirements are calculated as noted above for only those areas in which new land disturbance is taking place. This density may be achieved using one of the following methods:
1)
Calculate the area of any new land disturbance and add replacement trees based on that area (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option);
2)
Base density requirements on the total site area and count any existing trees on the site (subject to all restrictions noted elsewhere in these standards).
Ex: Sample Tree Density Calculation
(1)
A 2.2 acre site has a site density factor (SDF) of 2.2 x 17 = 37.4
(2)
The existing density factor (EDF) of trees to be preserved is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees slated for preservation to density units as follows (all existing trees are assumed to be hardwoods):

18" 8 x 1.9 = 15.2
10" 10 x 0.9 = 9.0
Total EDF  29.8
  (3)
Replacement density factor (RDF) calculates the minimum density of new trees to be planted by subtracting the EDF from the SDF:
RDF = 37.4 - 29.8 = 7.6 units required
(4)
Tables F-1 and F-2 are used to determine the RDF as follows:

Total RDF  11.2
EDF (29.8) + RDF (11.2) > SDF (37.4) therefore DENSITY SATISFIED
  d)
Specimen trees warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees that are successfully protected during the land disturbance and construction process [Subsections (I)(3) and (I)(4)]. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved shall be calculated at twice the assigned unit value shown in Table D. The following criteria are used by the Department of Development Services to identify specimen trees. Both size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify. In order to obtain double density credit for specimen trees, a certified arborist must provide written verification that the tree(s) meets the following criteria prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. However, failure to continuously protect any specimen tree(s) during the construction process may result in the loss of the additional tree density credit, thereby rendering the previously approved tree protection and landscape plan void, and a new plan will have to be submitted for review and approval by the Department of Development Services.

  E.
Methods of Tree Protection.
1.
The protective zone for designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the canopy drip line of the tree(s).
2.
Construction site activities such as material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., may not encroach into designated tree protective zones. Any such activity within the designated tree protective zones may render the previously approved tree protection and landscape plan void, and a new plan will have to be submitted for review and approval by the Department of Development Services.
3.
No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval by the Department of Development Services.
4.
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged over the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization, increase the effectiveness of protection measures and prevent pathology.
5.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones, which is defined as the area beneath the canopy drip line (See Figure A). Utilities must be placed between tree protective zones or incorporate those techniques described in Subsections (I)(3) and (I)(4).
F.
Protective Barriers.
1.
Prior to any land disturbance, active tree protective fencing shall be installed so that it surrounds the critical root zones of all protected tree zones, which is defined as the area beneath the canopy drip line (See Figure A).
2.
Active protective tree fences must be at least 4 feet high and may be either a wood and post construction or orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing.
3.
Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging (heavy mill, minimum 4 inches wide).
4.
All tree protection zones (both active and passive) should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances although the developer shall be held responsible for any violations found.
5.
All specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion control. Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface and shall be backed by 12 gauge 2-inch by 4-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope.
6.
All erosion control must comply with Article 7-8-12 of this section. All tree fencing and erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance process and building construction and may not be removed until landscaping is installed.
G.
Vehicle Use Areas.
1.
Parking lots: Interior landscaping of parking lots shall contain planter islands located so as to relieve the expanse of parking, provide shading and channel water runoff.
a)
A maximum of 12 parking spaces in a row shall be permitted without a planter island.
b)
Planter islands shall have a minimum of 125 square feet in area and shall contain at least 1 non-pine species tree having at installation a minimum caliper of 2 inches and 10 feet in height. This requirement may be waived in those instances in which facing parking rows are separated by a continuous island at least 5 feet in width containing at least 1 small or medium canopy tree every 20 feet. The remaining area shall be landscaped with appropriate materials.
c)
Encroachment: Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment. Car stops shall be required should any tree trunk be placed within 2 feet of a curb. Car stops shall be required in all instances where parking is adjacent to a landscaped area and curbing is not provided, to prevent damage to any trees by automobiles.
2.
Planted strip/border area: The intent of the planted border areas is to create tree-lined roadways that improve the quality of the built environment for pedestrians and motorists alike. All trees in planted borders must be classified as "Road Frontage Street" trees in Table G-2. Border areas are required on both sides of the roadway where applicable. Pine species are excluded from parking islands and along streets or accessways. The remainder of the planted area shall be landscaped with appropriate materials.
a)
Each area of the site which abuts any roadway, including public streets, private streets or improved accessways providing access to the interior of a development must provide a planted border parallel to the roadway as described below. Alleyways are excluded from any planted border requirements.
TABLE G-1. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANTED STRIP/BORDER AREAS
EXPAND

  b)
Street trees for individual lots within residential subdivisions shall be required based on total lineal road frontage as described above. Trees must be planted as close to the 10-foot landscape strip/border as possible but in no case shall trees located outside the front setback (or major side setback in case of comer lots) to be counted as street trees. Parcels used for purposes other than residential lots (common areas, detention areas, community clubhouses, etc.) shall follow the regulations for planted border areas. Trees must be medium or large canopy only and a minimum of 3-inch caliper.
c)
Street tree requirements for small lot subdivisions and townhouse subdivisions:
i.
One street tree per road frontage shall be required for individual lots within residential subdivisions that are developed for single-family attached homes (i.e. duplexes, townhouses, etc.) and/or single-family detached homes on smaller lots. "Small lot" shall be defined as a residential parcel with a minimum lot size of less than 7,500 square feet.
ii.
Street trees shall be planted no more than 2 feet from the public right-of-way or 5 feet from the back of curb or edge of sidewalk when coincident with the right-of-way. The intent is to create a planted strip/border area. In no case shall trees located outside the front yard setback (or major side yard setback in case of comer lots) be counted as street trees. Street trees on small lots shall be of a species listed in Table G-2 in the Tree Species Selection list and a minimum of 2½-inch caliper. Tree species not included on the list may be used when approved by staff in writing.
iii.
Large canopy trees may be used if there is more than 25 feet from the center of the tree to the closest portion of the house and at least 600 square feet of plantable area. Otherwise, all trees on small lots must be planted at least 10 feet from any structure.
iv.
Parcels used for purposes other than residential lots (common areas, detention areas, community clubhouses, etc.) shall follow the regulations in Table G-1 above for planted strip/border areas.
d)
Landscaped border areas may be interrupted to provide perpendicular vehicular and/or pedestrian ingress and egress, maximum 24 feet wide. Driveway or accessway interruptions shall be excluded from the calculations of total lineal feet to determine the number of trees required.
3.
In those instances where trees are planted closer than 5 feet from a public street or sidewalk, either concrete or HDPE (high density polyurethane plastic) root barriers may be required to be installed at the discretion of the Director of Public Works. These root barriers must be a minimum of 30 inches deep, but depending upon the size, location and specie of tree to be planted, the Director of Public works may require the root barrier to be 36 inches to 42 inches deep. Other methods or types of root barriers, i.e. biobarriers, may be considered at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
4.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not issue, and are not granted the authority to issue, variances to any of the regulations relating to vehicle use areas as contained in this paragraph; all such variance requests must be submitted to City Council for consideration.
H.
Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of specimen trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated protected tree zones, the following preventative measures shall be employed:
1.
Clearing activities: Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum 2-foot deep trenches (e.g. with a ditch-witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees.
2.
Soil compaction: Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree protective zone must first be mulched with a minimum 4-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips, or a 6-inch layer of pine straw.
3.
Trenching: The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching.
4.
Grade changes: Moderate fill can be tolerated within a tree's critical root zone with the prior installation of an aeration system. A decrease in grade is best accomplished through the use of retaining walls or terracing.
5.
When irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced with new trees of comparable unit value.
I.
Remediation. Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the trees' growing site and the damage is reparable. If encroachment is anticipated, these horticultural practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve tree survival.
1.
Once a tree has been damaged, it is advisable to delay pruning until the deadwood becomes evident (1—3 years). Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended. The removal of live plant tissue from a damaged tree can accelerate decline. Pruning of root severed trees may reduce the possibility of windthrow. Trees which have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for maintenance of the tree's health, appearance and safety.
2.
Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting root development.
3.
A tree's adequate root development, and ultimately its chances for survival, is improved with reclamation of the growing site. Whenever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural grade. Compacted soils within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated. The air exchange, nutrient, and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments. A 4- to 6-inch layer of mulch material, such as pine bark or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of trees on construction sites, is extremely beneficial.
4.
The availability of water to trees on construction sites should be monitored. If grade changes or excessive rain cause the accumulation of water near trees, steps must be taken to improve drainage. Conversely, if grade changes or prolonged periods without rain cause a drought situation, then irrigation may be necessary.
J.
Revegetation.
1.
The replacement of trees must occur if the EDF does not meet the calculated SDF. The quantity of replacement trees must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density factor which meets the requirements established in Subsection (D)(4). (Note: The terms 'unit' and 'tree' are not interchangeable.)
2.
Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens and ecologically compatible with the site. Table G-2 lists those species of trees generally acceptable for credit in density calculations based upon use or need. The Department of Development Services has information on trees and may accept alternatives to those listed in Table G-2. Pine species may only be planted in buffer or screening areas to the rear of the principal use and are specifically excluded from parking islands and along rights-of-way. No more than 50% of all new trees may be pine species, regardless of their planting location.
3.
Any portion of the subject property which is within a utility power easement is required to meet the height standards of the controlling entity. These areas may be required by the City to have additional vegetation installed to compensate for these restrictions, subject to approval from the Department of Development Services.
4.
All trees and landscaping shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and according to accepted planting procedures with quality materials as provided in literature from the Georgia Forestry Commission or the Georgia Extension Service. All landscaping shall be completed within 6 months after the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy; however any required fencing shall be installed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Should the landscaping not be completed in this period, it shall be deemed a violation of this section.
5.
The owner, occupant, tenant or agent, shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. Landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation. Any dead vegetation and landscaping material or any damaged nonliving landscaping materials shall be promptly replaced.
K.
General Landscaping Requirements. Beyond tree protection and revegetation, the extent of permissible impervious surfaces and required landscaping are regulated through the standards of the controlling zoning district. Landscaping may include grass, hedges and trees as well as natural features. All site plans submitted for new construction or renovations to an existing building according to Section 712.08(B) must contain a separate landscape plan which includes the following information:
1.
The name of the project.
2.
The name of the owner and/or developer.
3.
The location of proposed building(s) and corresponding dimensions.
4.
Spatial limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching.
5.
All required undisturbed buffers, landscape strips and parking islands.
6.
The location and listing of all specimen trees or stands of specimen trees.
7.
Areas of tree protection and revegetation and all relevant tree density calculations.
8.
The specific name and location of all materials to be planted or maintained on the site.
9.
Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation and maintenance of tree protection measures including, but not limited to, detail drawings of protective tree fencing (both active and passive) including signage and erosion control measures.
10.
Planting and staking specifications.
11.
The percentage of the total lot containing impervious surfaces.
12.
The percentage of the total lot which shall remain undisturbed.
13.
The percentage of the total lot devoted to landscaping.
14.
The location of any utilities, easements, or signs.
L.
Acceptable Tree Species. Table G denotes those species of trees which may be incorporated for full credit towards the tree replacement requirements of Subsection (D). Other trees may be approved on a case-by-case basis provided they are large growing and ecologically compatible with the site. Revegetation plans containing at least 10 new trees must incorporate at least 3 separate tree species with no single tree species accounting for more than 50% of all newly-planted trees. Pine trees can be utilized for screening and buffer areas only. All planting and replanting plans are subject to approval through the Department of Development Services.

  M.
Alternative Compliance.
1.
The intent of the tree protection and landscaping ordinance is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide an alternative in such cases, contributing to the City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund according to the Tree Replacement Fund requirements is acceptable (see Section 4-2). The following standards have been established for administering the alternative compliance method:
a)
The Department of Development Services must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 75% of the required density units be met through alternative compliance. Documentation from a certified Arborist or licensed Landscape Architect must be provided to assure that as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question.
b)
The land disturbance permit will only be issued after the Department of Development Services has approved the request for alternative compliance and received the necessary documentation and/or funds.
2.
Tree Replacement Fund. As an alternative method of compliance, the City of Marietta will accept donations that will be used for the purposes of purchasing, planting and maintaining trees on public property. Funds may be used for the purchase of forested greenspace. Funds may also be used for the creation of landscape plans involving the planting of trees on public property. Calculations for donations shall be based on 2-inch caliper replacement trees, the value of which is identified in the City of Marietta Fee Schedule. This value shall represent the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted within the City limits. To determine the appropriate contribution, first calculate the density factor deficit (DFD) or unit value that cannot be planted on the site. Divide the DFD by 0.4 (the unit value of a 2-inch caliper replacement tree) and multiply by the value identified in the City of Marietta Fee Schedule.
Ex.: A 2.2 acre site has a required Site Density Factor (SDF) of 37.4, an existing density factor (EDF) of 21.4 and can only accommodate a replacement density factor (RDF) of 9.0. Determine the density factor deficit (DFD) using the formula: DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF In this example, DFD = 37.4 - 21.4 - 9.0 = 7 Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 7÷0.4 X $(value) = $(contribution)
3.
Fund Administration. The City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund will be administered by the Department of Development Services. A quarterly report shall be submitted to the City Manager showing the amounts collected, amounts spent, and the types and locations of trees planted. The report will be made available to the Mayor and City Council upon their request.
N.
Interior Landscaping of Vehicle Use Areas. If sufficient cause is demonstrated that the required trees within the 10-foot landscape strip or within planter islands cannot be met, then the plan must show a method of alternative compliance. Sufficient cause is deemed to be when enforcing any of the requirements for the 10-foot landscape strip and/or the planter islands would violate any state or federal law, any ordinance of the City of Marietta, or zoning stipulation specific to the applicant. Should the placement of the trees within the 10-foot landscape strip and/or within the planter islands conflict with any existing above- or below-ground utilities, the Director of Development Services is hereby authorized to grant an administrative variance to allow one of the following solutions:
1.
Specific trees conflicting with existing utilities may be relocated elsewhere within the 10-foot landscape strip, so long as the proposed location will not create potential crowding issues.
2.
Specific trees conflicting with existing utilities may be relocated elsewhere on the site but within the front setback.
3.
Full canopied tree species conflicting with existing above-ground utilities may be substituted for a fastigiated variety listed in Table G-2.
4.
Medium or large canopied street trees planted in townhome or small lot subdivisions may be substituted with a tree listed in Table G-2, Small Lot Tree Species Selection List. Requests to replace street trees within an established subdivision zoned PRD-SF, PRD- MF, or MXD must be presented to City Council as a revised detailed plan by the Homeowners Association.
5.
Payment into the Tree Replacement Fund for the appropriate size of tree (according to Table G-1) using calculations specified under Subsection (M)(2).
O.
Enforcement, Violations and Penalties. Enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be the responsibility of the Department of Development Services. If, after inspection of a project by the administrator or their designee, the plan materials installed on the site do not comply with the approved plan, the applicant and property owner shall be notified of such deficiencies in writing. If the administrator deems the deviations from the approved plan acceptable, they will so note, and the applicant, property owner, and/or representative will be required to submit a revised plan within 10 days showing the actual plantings. If, after inspection, the administrator or their designee determines the site does not comply with the approved plan and further determines it to be unacceptable, the applicant and property owner shall be notified in writing by the Department of Development Services of said violations, and given 10 days in which to correct all violations. Failure to make such corrections shall be a violation of this section.
P.
Appeal. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority and duty to consider and act upon any application submitted for adjustment of standards provided herein, unless otherwise noted. In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide appeals from the decision of the Development Services Director.

712.09 - Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District.
A.
Intent and Purpose. The Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District is established to enhance the quality and compatibility of development, to establish consistent architectural and design guidelines, to encourage the most appropriate use of land, and to promote safe and efficient movement of traffic. The district is deemed necessary to enhance the aesthetic and visual character of lands adjacent to main commercial corridors in and around Downtown Marietta. All applicable developments proposed within this District shall be subject to procedures, standards, and guidelines specified in the following sections, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular zoning district in which the development occurs. In particular, the purpose of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District is to better articulate positive visual experiences in Marietta's downtown area; to provide for the continued safe and efficient utilization of roads; to promote pedestrian mobility and safety; and to provide for the preservation of historically significant structures. This will be accomplished through evaluation of all applicable developments within the districts by City staff. Staff shall use the point system of specific criteria as described later in this section. It is the purpose of such review to determine whether the proposed plan meets the guidelines and other criteria of this section.
B.
Delineation of District.
1.
The Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District shall include:
a.
The rights-of-way and all parcels lying in whole or in part within 750 feet of rights-of- way line of any road designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. The boundary of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District shall not project beyond the designated terminating point.
b.
Roads that are designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District include Whitlock Avenue from Lindley Avenue to the westernmost intersection of Manning Road, Fairground Street from Birney Street to South Cobb Drive, Powder Springs Road from the South Marietta Parkway to the intersection of Laurel Springs Lane and Longwood Drive, Roswell Street from Haynes Street to US 41, Atlanta Street from Waverly Way to South Cobb Drive, and the North Marietta Parkway from Kennesaw Avenue to Whitlock Avenue, and South Marietta Parkway from Whitlock Avenue to Powder Springs Street.
c.
The boundary of this district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta.
d.
If the proposed development will not be visible from the principal thoroughfare of the overlay district once the project is completed, the Director of Development Services has the administrative authority to waive the requirements of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. Parcels of land directly abutting roads designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay Ordinance listed in subsection 712.09.B.1.b. and development that incorporate mixed-use components listed in subsections 712.09.F.1. and 712.09.G.1. are not eligible for waiver of design review requirements.
C.
Relationship to Existing Zoning Districts. In all existing zoning districts located within the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District the regulations for the zoning district, other zoning codes, and the overlay district shall apply. In cases where there is a conflict between the regulations of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District and other sections of the zoning ordinance the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District shall take precedence.
D.
Developments Exempt from the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. The following activities or uses shall be exempt from the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay requirements and development review, although they may be reviewed under separate administrative procedures where noted in this section or in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code.
1.
Nonconforming Structures. If a nonconforming structure is to be retained then the structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or repaired if such construction would exceed 50% of its replacement cost. If rebuilding, alteration, or repair of a nonconforming structure exceeds 50% of the replacement cost, then the building shall be required to conform to all provisions of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District Ordinance.
2.
Single Family Residences on Individual Lots. All single-family structures located on single-family detached residentially zoned lots are exempt from this chapter but shall comply with the provisions set forth in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code. Compliance with these provisions shall be verified through the building permit process. Any single-family residential structure that is altered for commercial use shall comply with the provisions set forth in this section.
3.
Downtown Marietta Historic District. Properties that are contained within the Marietta Historic District as identified on the Official Historic Map of Marietta are exempt from this section but shall comply with Article 7-8-8 of the Marietta Municipal Code.
E.

712.10 - Purpose.
A.
Purpose and Intent The Conservation Subdivision Overlay (CSO) District is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural and cultural resource conservation. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create pedestrian scale and other public benefits. The CSO district is intended to:
1.
Provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
2.
Provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
3.
Preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
4.
Permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils, which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
5.
Reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
6.
Promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
7.
Promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
8.
Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
9.
Encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
10.
Promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
11.
Conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
12.
Preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
B.

712.11 - Residential Infill Development Overlay District.
A.
Purpose and Intent. It is in the public interest to maximize efficiency of the utilization of public services, infrastructure, and facilities as a means to achieve balanced growth and to provide a cost-effective method for municipal service delivery. Within the residential areas of the identified urban core of Marietta, there exists an opportunity to achieve maximum utilization of land resources that have been by-passed or under-utilized in the development of the urban area. An increase in the density normally allowed by the underlying zoning district is deemed an appropriate incentive to promote infill development and redevelopment within this urban core for single-family residential detached districts. The specific objectives of this ordinance as related to infill development and redevelopment in the identified urban core of Marietta are:
•
Accommodate growth by encouraging and facilitating new single-family housing on vacant and underutilized land, in areas that already have infrastructure, utilities, and public facilities, while addressing the needs of Marietta's residents;
•
Accommodate growth by encouraging and facilitating new single-family housing on properties currently developed as duplex units;
•
Accommodate growth by aligning zoning and land use in a manner that is consistent with trends in urban redevelopment;
•
Encourage efficient use of land and public services in the context of existing communities;
•
Provide flexibility in development standards to facilitate infill development and redevelopment;
•
Encourage construction of housing in close proximity to employment and services;
•
Promote neighborhood preservation and enhancement through redevelopment of blighted, distressed and underutilized properties.
B.
Applicability. This district implements the Infill Development Zone (IDZ).

•
Parcels identified in the applicability section of this ordinance.
D.
Relationship to Existing Zoning Districts. All provisions of the City Code that would apply to a non-infill project shall also apply to infill projects unless specifically modified in this ordinance. The developer of property that falls within the area covered by this ordinance may choose to develop his/her property using these standards. If the developer chooses to use the standards set forth in this ordinance then the standards of this section shall take precedence over those of the underlying zoning designation and other sections of the zoning ordinance, unless otherwise stated herein. If the developer chooses to use the standards of the underlying zoning designation, the standards of this ordinance will not apply to his/her property.
