Restrictions for areas within apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, or other such residential dwelling units.
Except for persons within commercial enterprises that have an adjoining property line or boundary with a residential dwelling unit, it is unlawful for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made or continued any excessive noise or impulsive noise in such a manner as to be plainly audible to any other person a distance of five feet beyond the adjoining property line wall or boundary of any apartment, condominium, townhouse, duplex, or other such residential dwelling units with adjoining points of contact.
For the purposes of this subsection, "noise" shall mean human-produced sounds of yelling, shouting, whistling, singing, or mechanically-produced sounds made by radio-receiving device, television, stereo, musical instrument, phonograph sound amplifier or other machines or devices for the producing, reproducing, or amplifying of sound, or any combination thereof.
For the purposes of this subsection, "property line or boundary" shall mean an imaginary line drawn through the points of contact of (1) adjoining apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes or other such residential dwelling units with adjoining points owned, rented, or leased by different persons; or (2) adjoining common areas or adjoining exterior walls. Said property line or boundary includes all points of a plane formed by projecting the property line or boundary including the ceiling, the floor, and the walls.
(b)
Prohibited conduct—Commercial and related Zones (C1, C2, MD and neighborhood grocery store district).
(1)
No person shall make, continue, or cause to be made or continued, except as permitted, any noise disturbance, or any noise in excess of the limits for such noise established in this section.
(2)
Maximum permissible sound levels. With the exception of sound levels elsewhere specifically authorized by this article, table 1 below sets forth the maximum permissible sound levels allowed at or within the real property boundary of a receiving land use. Any activity or use that produces a sound in excess of such noise levels for a receiving land use shall be deemed a noise disturbance and is in violation of this article.
(3)
Measurement of sound. The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter meeting the standards prescribed by the American National Standards Institute or its successor body. The instrument shall be maintained in calibration and good working order. Octave band corrections may be employed in meeting the response specification. A calibration check shall be made of the system at the time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source. The microphone used during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used when required. Traffic, other transportation noise sources and other background noises shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured. It is the intention that this sound to be measured is what is being created by the subject sound or the sound being investigated excluding intruding noises from isolated identifiable sources, but including ambient sound level. The measure of all sound levels shall be made as close to the property line of a receiving land use as is practical.

ARTICLE VI. - GRAFFITI[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 03-2019 , § 1, adopted May 9, 2019, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 22-197 and 22-197-1—22-197-7. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as Art. VI, §§ 22-221—22-227.

Sec. 22-221. - Purpose and intent.
The city council is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The council is authorized to enact this article pursuant to its police powers under Georgia law, as well as the city Charter, to provide for the removal of graffiti from private and public property.
(Ord. No. 03-2019 , § 1, 5-9-2019)
Sec. 22-222. - Findings; nuisance.
Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners, as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to require the removal of graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain and other properties then become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable all to the detriment of the city. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (less than 72 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. The city finds that graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.
The city council intends, through the adoption of this article to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. This article is not intended to conflict with any existing state laws prohibiting or impacting graffiti.
(Ord. No. 03-2019 , § 1, 5-9-2019)
