Sec. 12-26. - Definitions.
Active park area, for purposes of this article only, means any City of Doraville recreational facility or section thereof that is characterized by formally designated athletic fields or outdoor courts (basketball, volleyball, tennis, etc.). The use of cleats is permitted on designated athletic fields. Active park areas are also characterized by specialized development and management which may include additional restrictions on use or scheduling. Examples of active recreational area uses include baseball, soccer, football and lacrosse. Any activity where the participants wear cleats is deemed to be an active park area only use.
Passive park area, for purposes of this article only, means any City of Doraville recreational facility or section thereof that is dedicated for recreational activities that do not materially alter the landscape, degrade environmental quality, nor involve commercial recreational use. Recreational activities involving nine (9) or more people acting in concert or any activity where cleats are worn must be carried out in active park areas and are not permitted in passive park areas. Passive park areas are designed for uses such as viewing nature, horseshoes, walking, sitting and random play. Passive park areas are used for less structured activities which require little or no specialized land development or management.
