Secs. 64-338—64-356. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - STANDARDS, QUALIFICATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

Sec. 64-357. - Standard component.
(a)
Number and affordability of inclusionary units. For all residential developments of 20 units or more, the inclusionary housing component shall consist of inclusionary units developed for, offered to, and leased or sold to very low, low, and moderate income households as follows: at least five percent of the units must be restricted to occupancy of moderate income households and five percent of the units must be restricted to occupancy of low or very low income households. For the purposes of calculating the number of inclusionary units, any decimal fraction of 0.5 or more shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
(b)
Location of inclusionary units. Except as provided in this article, inclusionary units shall be built on the site of the development project and must be dispersed throughout a residential development.
(c)
Timing of development. The inclusionary housing plan and inclusionary housing agreement shall include a phasing plan, which provides for the timely development of the inclusionary units as the residential project is built out. The phasing plan shall provide for development of the inclusionary units concurrently with the market rate units; provided, however, that the phasing plan will be adjusted by the director of community development away from strict concurrency where necessary in order to account for the different financing and funding environments, economies of scale, and infrastructure needs applicable to development of the market rate and the inclusionary units.
(d)
Design. Inclusionary units for single-family shall be comparable in infrastructure (including sewer, water and other utilities), construction quality, and exterior design to the market rate units. Inclusionary units may be smaller in aggregate size and have different interior finishes and features than market rate units so long as the interior features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing.
(1)
Inclusionary single-family units must be a minimum of:
a.
1,600 square feet for moderate income households;
b.
1,250 square feet for low income households; and
c.
1,000 square feet for very low income households.
(2)
The number of bedrooms in the inclusionary units should be comparable in number to those in the market rate units. The ratio of bathrooms per bedroom should be equal to the ratio of bathrooms per bedroom in market rate units. Multifamily design standards shall be consistent with the proposed development.
(e)
Unit size. The inclusionary housing component shall accommodate diverse family sizes by including a mix of studio, one, two and three-bedroom units as determined by the director of community development, upon recommendation by the director of the office of housing.
(f)
Exterior appearance. Inclusionary units shall be visually compatible with the market rate units. External building materials and finishes shall be the same type and quality for inclusionary units as for market rate units. Interior materials finishes may vary.
(g)
Development standards. Except as provided in the inclusionary housing agreement pursuant to this article, inclusionary units shall comply with all applicable development standards.
Sec. 64-358. - Public funding (incentives, assistance and subsidies).
(a)
The developer of a development project subject to the inclusionary housing provisions may request that the city provide inclusionary incentives as set forth in this article. The goal of these inclusionary incentives is to apply available incentives to qualifying projects in a manner that, to the extent feasible, offsets the cost of providing the inclusionary housing component. The director of community development shall respond to that request at the time and in the manner specified in this article, and shall make a determination as to a package of inclusionary incentives for the inclusionary units as provided in this article.
(1)
Fee waivers or deferrals. Upon application, the city shall make available to a residential project developer a program of waiver, reduction or deferral of development fees, impact fee waiver, administrative and financing fees for inclusionary units. Such a program may include application, on behalf of a developer, to other government entities for fee waiver and deferral program for waiver and/or deferral of other impact or development fees.
(2)
Modification of development standards. Upon application, the city may modify for inclusionary units, to the extent feasible in light of the uses, design, and infrastructure needs of the development project, as determined by the director of community development and the office of housing director, development standards including, but not limited to:
a.
Road widths;
b.
Curb and gutter;
c.
Parking; and
d.
Housing types.
(3)
Interior finish reductions. Upon application, the city may, to the maximum extent appropriate in light of project design elements as determined by the director of community development, allow builders to finish out the interior of inclusionary units with less expensive finishes and appliances.
(4)
Streamlining and priority processing. The director of community development shall expedite development permits for residential projects that include an inclusionary housing component. The city shall develop further procedures for streamlining and priority processing which relieve inclusionary units of permit processing requirements to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the public health, safety and welfare.
(5)
Density bonus. The city shall make available to the residential project a density bonus as provided in this article. The number of units allowed may be increased by 20 percent; provided, however, that the affordability requirements to qualify for a density bonus shall be those stated in this article.
(6)
Local public funding. The developer may apply to the office of housing for local public funding to assist in the financing and development of the inclusionary housing component. Local public funding may serve to facilitate state allocation of tax credits, mortgage revenue bond funds, or state or federal assistance to the project ("external subsidy"); provided that the provision of such local public funding requires that the developer diligently pursue such external subsidy and is not intended to substitute for such external subsidy. A developer seeking local public funding shall apply to the office of housing director for such funding pursuant to this article. The office of housing director shall submit the proposed local public funding assistance package to the director of community development for inclusion in the city's inclusionary incentives for the project.
(b)
The office of housing director, as to the feasible elements of local public funding and in making the determination as to inclusion of local public funding in the inclusionary incentives, shall consider:
(1)
The number, percentage, and tenure of the units for very low income or low income households in the inclusionary housing component;
(2)
The financial structure and financing needs of the inclusionary housing component;
(3)
The cost-efficiency of the solution to the inclusionary housing component;
(4)
The developer's initiatives in applying for grants and other funds external to local public funding;
(5)
The availability of funds given the funding priorities of the office of housing and other funding agencies at the time, and other development of housing for very low or low income households under way, proposed or anticipated; and
(6)
Other factors necessary to the evaluation.
The office of housing shall adopt and provide to developers and other interested parties criteria for evaluation of applicants for local public funding. These criteria may be contained in the guidelines as outlined by the office of housing.
Sec. 64-359. - Construction of component to avoid over concentration.
The following principles shall apply to the development of the inclusionary housing component:
(1)
The inclusionary housing plan shall provide for the dispersal of buildings containing inclusionary units to the maximum extent feasible taking into account the funding and financing environments applicable to a inclusionary housing development.
(2)
Multifamily buildings may contain any proportion of inclusionary units, but no inclusionary housing development may be located adjacent to another inclusionary housing development. For purposes of this article, inclusionary housing development means a development containing a building with more than eight units for multifamily or for all residential developments of 20 units or more, in which ten percent of the total units must be inclusionary units restricted for occupancy by very low, low, or moderate income households except as otherwise provided for herein. The director of community development may allow for variation from these principles, but only the extent necessary, if he or she determines that an alternative configuration of inclusionary units is required by funding or financing considerations associated with the development of the inclusionary units or by the applicable residential land use designations within and adjacent to the residential project.
(3)
Proposed inclusionary single-family housing developments that are located within a census tracks in which 95 percent of the existing units are below 80 percent AMI, must submit a housing development plan that includes the following mixed housing price points for sale:
EXPAND
Mixed Housing Points For Sale
20% Percent not to exceed $150,000.00
60% Between $150,000 and $216,000.00
20% Market
  Sec. 64-360. - Alternatives.
Subject to the approval of the city council, in lieu of constructing affordable housing units on site, a developer may dedicate land or pay in-lieu housing fees. At the time of concept plan review, the developer shall be required to provide a report to the community development director identifying the reasons the construction of the required number of affordable housing units within the development is not feasible. The report shall include sufficient independent data, including appropriate financial information, which supports the developer's claim that it is not feasible to construct the required affordable units and a detailed analysis of why the density bonus cannot mitigate the conditions that prevent the developer from constructing the affordable units. The director shall review all such requests and prepare a recommendation to the city council. Such requests shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city council and may be approved at the city council's sole discretion. The monetary value of an alternative equivalent must be equal to or exceed the cost to produce the required number of affordable housing units on site.
(1)
Land dedication and off-site compliance options. Upon a determination by the director of community development that the criteria outlined in subsection (1)d. of this section have been met, a residential project may provide all or part of its inclusionary housing component by means of the following options:
a.
Dedication of land to the city at no cost. Under this option, a developer may donate to the city a site on which all or a portion of the mandated inclusionary units can be built. The dedicated site must be located in the same planning area (as defined by the comprehensive plan) in unincorporated Fulton County and must be physically suitable for development at the time of conveyance. It must be of sufficient size and properly zoned to accommodate the requisite number of units. It must already have access to water and sewer and public services (police, fire, etc.). The property should not have physical constraints that cause delay or increase construction costs (e.g., grading) or be unsuitable for residential development (e.g., contain toxins). The developer shall provide an appraisal of the land and its appraised value shall be confirmed by the city's land division of the general services department.
b.
Development of inclusionary units off-site. Inclusionary units may be constructed outside the development project within an area ("off-site") for a residential project that is single-family or multifamily.
c.
Combination. A combination of the options contained in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
d.
Standard for approval. The director of community development may approve the proposal only if it provides a more cost-efficient solution to the inclusionary housing component than the standard approach set forth in this article, or if the location of off-site development would be superior to on-site development from the perspective of access to transportation or other applicable residential planning policies in the city comprehensive plan.
e.
Number of inclusionary units credited to the dedication or off-site location. The number of inclusionary units credited to the dedication or off-site location will consist of the number of inclusionary units which can with reasonable degree of certainty be developed on the land, given:
1.
The mix of inclusionary unit sizes and type of structure in the inclusionary housing plan;
2.
Densities permitted by applicable planning and zoning designations; and
3.
Site, infrastructure, environmental and other physical and planning constraints.
f.
Site suitability. The land proposed for dedication or for off-site location must be suitable from the perspective of size, configuration, physical characteristics, physical and environmental constraints, access, location, adjacent use, and other relevant planning criteria. The site must allow development of inclusionary units in a manner that complies with this article including the over concentration provisions set forth in section 64-358.
g.
Site identification and regulatory status. The developer must identify the proposed dedicated site or off-site location and the number of proposed units to be credited thereby as part of the inclusionary housing plan required in this article. At the same time or before the development project receives its inclusionary incentives, the dedicated or off-site land shall have received all the inclusionary incentives necessary for development of the inclusionary units on such land. Unless the phasing plan requires otherwise, at the same time or before a residential project receives its first project specific entitlements, the dedicated or off-site land shall have received all the necessary project-level approvals necessary for development of the inclusionary units on such land, and prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for a residential project, the dedicated land or off-site land shall be fully served with the infrastructure necessary for residential development.
h.
Director of community development action. The director of community development may recommend conditional approval or denial of the proposed land dedication or off-site development proposal. In reviewing the proposal, the director of community development will consult with the director of the office of housing. If the land dedication or the off-site proposal is accepted or accepted as modified, the relevant elements of the inclusionary housing plan shall be included in the applicable legislative approvals for both the residential development generating the requirement for the inclusionary housing component and, if applicable, the dedicated site or off-site development project where all or part of that requirement is proposed to be met. If the dedication or off-site proposal is rejected, the inclusionary housing component shall be provided as set forth in this article within the development project.
i.
Implementation. As early as possible in the regulatory process, and in no case later than the negotiation of the inclusionary housing agreement as provided in this article, the owner of the residential project must:
(1)
In the case of land dedication, provide an irrevocable offer of dedication for the dedicated site at no cost to the city; and
(2)
In the case of off-site land, demonstrate to the director of community development and the office of housing director that the off-site location is and will remain committed to the timely development of the inclusionary units as provided in the inclusionary housing plan. This commitment may be demonstrated through ownership of the off-site location, or through adequate control of the use of the off-site location through joint ownership, joint venture or other contractual means. If necessary to ensure that inclusionary housing units are developed contemporaneously with the market rate units, the director of community development may require the offer of dedication or evidence of off-site control as early as the first legislative entitlement. With respect to an off-site location, the director of community development may also condition development or occupancy of the residential project on development or occupancy of the off-site inclusionary units, and the inclusionary housing agreement must apply to and be recorded against both the residential project and the off-site land. With respect to dedicated land, the city, upon acceptance of the offer of dedication, shall publish a request for proposal for development of the site, which will result in the production of the number of inclusionary units credited to the site.
(2)
In-lieu housing fees. For residential developments of 20 or more units, including inclusionary units, the requirements of this article may be satisfied by paying an in-lieu fee to the affordable housing trust fund.
a.
Under this option, the developer may pay an amount equivalent to the cost of constructing the mandated units at the required affordability levels. Fees shall be calculated for the construction of affordable housing units for moderate and low and very low income households and shall be adjusted annually based upon the estimated average construction cost per square foot of floor area for single-family (not including the value of the improved lot) as estimated for the region (south) by the National Association of Home Builders or the American Apartment Association for multifamily development.
b.
The city manager shall establish an affordable housing trust fund for the receipt and management of in-lieu housing fees. Monies received into the fund shall be utilized solely for the construction or purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of the section. In all cases, the required number of housing units at the required levels of affordability shall be provided for by this fund.
c.
Fees must be paid within ten calendar days of issuance of a building permit for the development or the permit will be null and void. For phased developments, payments may be made for each portion of the development within ten calendar days of the issuance of a building permit for that phase. When payment is delayed, in the event of default, or for any other reason, the amount of the in-lieu fee payable under this section will be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid.
d.
No final inspection for occupancy will be completed for any corresponding market rate unit in a residential development unless the fees required under this section have been paid in full to the community development department.
(3)
Combined dedication of land and in-lieu housing fees. Under this option, the developer may dedicate land and pay in-lieu housing fees equivalent to the cost of producing the mandated units at the required affordability levels. The developer shall provide an appraisal of the land and its appraised value shall be confirmed by the city's land division of the general services department.

For sale single-family unit. Units shall remain affordable for a period of no less than 15 years from the recordation of the affordable housing agreement;
Sec. 64-363. - Affordability and resale of for-sale units (sustainability policy).
Each affordable unit created in accordance with this article shall have limitations governing its resale. The purpose of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability for affordable income households. The resale controls shall be established through a restriction on the property and shall be in force for a period of 15 years concurrent with an equity-sharing program between the city and the homeowner.
(1)
Initial sale. To ensure that only eligible households purchase affordable housing units, the purchaser of an affordable unit shall be required to submit copies of the last three years' federal and state income tax returns and certify, in writing and prior to the transfer of title, to the developer of the housing units or his or her agent, and within 30 days following transfer of title, to the local housing trust, community development corporation, housing authority or other agency as established by the city, that household's annual income level does not exceed the maximum level as established by the office of housing, and as may be revised from time to time.
(2)
Maximum cost. The maximum housing cost for affordable units created under this article is as established by the office of housing and the local initiative program or as revised by the city.
(3)
Resale to an income eligible person exception. The owner of a residential project shall sell inclusionary housing units to an income-eligible initial owner at an affordable price. Thereafter for a period of 15 years from the recordation of the note or other document as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the initial owner and any subsequent owner shall notify the office of housing in writing of their intent to sell the inclusionary unit. The homeowner or his or her assignee shall have 90 days from receipt of the notification to identify, qualify, and refer to the seller an income-eligible purchaser or request an extension. The initial owner and any subsequent owner shall sell the unit to the referred purchaser at the resale price established by the office of housing as provided in subsection (5) of this section. In the event that the homeowner or his or her assignee does not complete the purchase of the unit within the time frames specified in the first part of this section, an extension for the sale of the inclusionary unit must be obtained from the office of housing.
(4)
Recordation of note; agreement or covenant and recapture upon sale. At the time of the initial sale and any subsequent sale to an income-eligible purchaser, the office of housing shall record an interest-bearing note, secured by a deed of trust, and regulatory agreement or covenant to recapture the difference between the inclusionary unit's market value, as determined by an appraiser approved by the office of housing, and its affordable housing price at the time of sale or resale. The office of housing shall also record a deed of trust encumbering any other monetary inclusionary incentives. The deed of trust, regulatory agreement, or covenant shall require that for a period of no less than 15 years, the unit may be resold to an income eligible purchaser.
a.
The full principal amount and interest will be due upon:
1.
The sale to any nonincome eligible purchaser;
2.
A change of use from an owner-occupied residential unit to any other use or if the inclusionary unit is rented; and
3.
Any refinance of the inclusionary unit without the office of housing's approval.
b.
The office of housing shall apply all recaptured funds to subsidize other for sale inclusionary housing units.
(5)

This percentage shall be recorded as part of the restriction on the property noted in subsection (3) of this section. For example, if a unit appraised for $100,000.00, is sold for $75,000.00 as a result of this article, it has sold for 75 percent of its appraised value. If, several years later, the appraised value of the unit at the time of proposed resale is $150,000.00, the unit may be sold for no more than $112,500.00 (75 percent of the appraised value of $150,000.00).
a.
Right of first refusal to purchase. The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed as a result of this zoning ordinance shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by their attorney, consistent with model riders prepared by the office of housing, granting, among other things, the city's right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event that a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located.
b.
The office of housing shall require, as a condition for permitting under this article, that the applicant comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of the deed rider noted in this section. The community development department shall not issue an occupancy permit for any affordable unit until the deed restriction is recorded.
(6)
Equity sharing program. A homeowner is entitled to a share of the equity for each year of ownership pursuant to policies established by the office of housing.
a.
After the expiration of the 15-year affordability period, the homeowner must pay:
1.
One-half of the excess of the total resale price over the sum of:
(i)
The prior maximum sales price;
(ii)
A percentage of the affordable unit's prior purchase price with the cost-of-living increase since last sold; or
(iii)
The fair market value of the documented capital improvements; and
2.
A reasonable sales and commission.
b.
If the amount remaining is less than $20,000.00, the amount due to the special revenue fund will be adjusted so the seller receives $10,000.00. If the amount is less than $10,000.00, the seller will receive the entire amount.
(7)

a.
The resale value of the inclusionary unit falls below the market value of the unit at its last sale; or

Inclusionary housing agreement.
(1)
Requirement. No development agreement or project-specific approval may be issued by the city without an executed inclusionary housing agreement executed by the owner, the developer (if not owner), and the director of the office of housing acting with the advice of the community development director. Recordation of the agreement shall be a condition of approval of any development agreement, disposition and development agreement or project-level approval.
(2)
Timing. The inclusionary housing agreement shall be negotiated concurrently with the processing of an application for the earlier of a development agreement or the first project-specific approval. At the request of the developer, and if the developer makes the project development and financing details set forth in subsections (3) and (4) of this section available, the inclusionary housing agreement may be negotiated earlier in connection with the issuance of a legislative entitlement.
(3)
Contents. The agreement shall be consistent with the inclusionary housing plan, and shall indicate: ownership or rental project, the number and size of moderate, very low and low income units, the developer of the inclusionary units, the phasing and construction scheduling of the units, commitments for inclusionary incentives, including office of housing commitments for local public subsidy, and any other information required by the office of housing relative to the inclusionary housing component. In the case of land dedication or off-site inclusionary housing, the agreement shall also contain the information required in this subsection.
(4)
Information required from developer. The developer of the development project shall present to the community development department and office of housing:
a.
Plans, schematics, and details of phasing of the residential project as a whole including the inclusionary housing component;

Any guidelines developed pursuant to this article.
b.
The office of housing shall determine the inclusionary incentives it will make available in connection with the residential project as provided in this article.
c.
The inclusionary housing agreement shall specify the nature and amount of local public funding. If the city fails to make available the inclusionary incentives set forth in an executed and recorded inclusionary housing agreement, the residential project shall be relieved of the portion of the inclusionary obligation that represents the percentage of local public funding committed in the agreement but not provided.
d.
At the city's option, the agreement may provide that if the local public funding component of the inclusionary incentives is delayed beyond the time provided for in the agreement, the construction of inclusionary units may be deferred until funding availability, or that during the period of delay, the owner may offer the inclusionary units as rental units at market rate until such time as the local public funding indicated in the agreement becomes available, at which time such rental units, upon being voluntarily vacated by existing market rate tenants, would be offered as inclusionary units.
(6)
Incorporation into project-level approvals and recordation. The developer's obligations and the inclusionary incentives in the agreement shall be incorporated into the project-specific approvals. The executed agreement shall be recorded as a covenant running with the land against the real property of the residential project and, in the case of off-site inclusionary units, against the real property on which such units are to be located.
(g)
Administration of affordability for rental inclusionary housing. The owner of rental inclusionary units shall be responsible for certifying the income of tenant to the office of housing at the time of initial rental and annually thereafter. The owner of rental inclusionary units shall apply the same rental terms and conditions (except rent levels, deposits and income requirements) to tenants of inclusionary units as are applied to all other tenants, except as otherwise required to comply with government subsidy programs. Discrimination based on subsidies received by the prospective tenant is prohibited. The city office of housing shall keep confidential the personal identifying information of the household members occupying an inclusionary unit.
(h)
Guidelines. The office of housing multifamily development financing guidelines and the office of housing single-family ownership housing financing guidelines shall apply to inclusionary housing developed under this article.
