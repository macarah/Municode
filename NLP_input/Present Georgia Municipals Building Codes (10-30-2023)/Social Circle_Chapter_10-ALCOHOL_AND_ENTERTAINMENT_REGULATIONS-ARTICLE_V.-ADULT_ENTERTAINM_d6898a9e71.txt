ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 10-176. - Findings, public purposes.
(a)
Findings. Based on experiences of other counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to problems faced by the city the council notes the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served.
The council also finds that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems.
(b)
Purposes. The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions.
