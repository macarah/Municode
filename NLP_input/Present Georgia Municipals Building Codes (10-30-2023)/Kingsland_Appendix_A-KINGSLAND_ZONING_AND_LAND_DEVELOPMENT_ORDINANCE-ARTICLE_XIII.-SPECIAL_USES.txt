Sec. 130.3. - Solar array ordinance.
130.3.1. Intent.
The purpose of this ordinance is to facilitate the siting, construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of solar energy systems ("SESs") in City of Kingsland.
The intent of ordinance is to increase energy security and diversify the energy portfolio, to promote the use of Georgia-based energy resources, to decrease the cost of energy, to bolster local economic development and employment prospects, to increase consumers' choices in energy consumption, to encourage the use of a renewable energy resource, to support the City of Kingsland's sustainability agenda, and to reduce air and water pollution.
130.3.2. Applicability.
(a)
This Ordinance applies to the siting, construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of any SES within the jurisdiction of City of Kingsland.
(b)
Any SES that, prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, (1) is currently in operation, (2) has received approval from City of Kingsland to operate, or (3) is being constructed, if no such approval was required, shall be exempt from complying with this Ordinance, unless:
(1)
The acreage of land occupied by the SES is increased by more than 50 percent; or
(2)
More than 50 percent of the solar panels on the SES are replaced.
All SES shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the requirements of the City of Kingsland zoning ordinance.
130.3.3. Definitions.
Building-integrated solar energy system means an SES where solar materials are used in place of traditional building components such that the SES is structurally an integral part of a house, building, or other structure, for example as a building facade, skylight, or shingles.
Ground mounted solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the ground. For purposes of this Ordinance, the acreage of land occupied by a ground mounted solar energy system is calculated by drawing a perimeter around the outermost SES solar panels and auxiliary structures. Substations and transmission lines outside this perimeter shall not be included in the calculation.
Intermediate scale ground mounted solar energy system (intermediate scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies between 16 and 50 acres.
Large scale ground mounted solar energy system (large scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies more than 51 acres.
Ordinance means this solar ordinance.
Permit means any permit required by federal, state, or local law or regulation, including this Ordinance.
Planning and community development department means the applicable county or city land use decision-making body as determined by local ordinance and appeal procedures.
Rooftop solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the roof of a house, building, or other structure.
Small scale ground mounted solar energy system (small scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies less than 15 acres.
Solar energy system means a device or structural design feature that provides for the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for electricity generation.
For purposes of this Ordinance, SES refers only to (1) photovoltaic SESs that convert solar energy directly into electricity through a semiconductor device or (2) solar thermal systems that use collectors to convert the sun's rays into useful forms of energy for water heating, space heating, or space cooling. SES as used in this Ordinance excludes concentrated solar systems that use mirrors to focus the energy from the sun to create thermal energy that can be used to produce electricity.
Visual buffer means natural vegetation, which provides a visual and lighting barrier between an SES and a residential property. The visual buffer is not part of the SES and shall not be included when (1) calculating the acreage of land occupied by the SES, or (2) determining whether the SES adheres to applicable setback requirements.
130.3.4. Requirements applicable to solar energy systems.
130.3.4.1. Types of solar energy systems.
