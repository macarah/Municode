The followings words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Cleared (as applied to taximeters) means a taximeter is inoperative with respect to all fare indication, when no indication of fare or extras is shown and when all parts are in those positions in which they are designed to be when the vehicle on which the taximeter is installed is not engaged by a passenger.

Multiple-tariff taximeter means a taximeter that may be set to calculate fares at any one of two (2) or more rates.

(c)
Taxicabs providing taxicab services shall be subject to two (2) random inspections of taximeters per calendar year. The following will be inspected:
Taximeter inspection criteria. All taxicabs shall comply with the following at all times, and all random inspections shall be conducted by the department at a designated location and time and shall consist of the following inspection:
a.
Design of indicating elements.
i.
Generally. A taximeter shall be equipped with a primary indicating element.
ii.
Advancement of indicating elements. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, the primary indicating elements shall be susceptible of advancement only by the rotation of the vehicle wheels or by the time mechanism.
iii.
Visibility of indications. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, indications of fare and extras shall be clearly shown on its face at all times and at least ten (10) millimeter high for the fare and four (4) millimeter high for all other indications.
iv.
Actuation of fare-indicating mechanism. When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicating mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism.
b.
Operating condition.
i.
Generally. Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown.
ii.
Single-tariff taximeter. Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown on the taximeter face.
iii.
Multiple-tariff taximeter. Whenever a multiple-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown on the taximeter face.
iv.
Extra charges. Extra charges shall be indicated as a separate item and shall not be included in the fare indication. They shall be identified by the term "extras" or by an equivalent expression. Values shall be defined by suitable words or monetary signs.
v.
Protection of indications. Indications of fare and extras shall be displayed on the taximeter face through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter.
vi.
Basis of fare calculations. A taximeter shall calculate fares only upon the basis of distance traveled, time elapsed or a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed.
c.
Design of operating control.
i.
Means of control. A control lever-arm knob, handle or other convenient and effective means shall be provided to set the taximeter mechanism for the desired operating condition and to clear the taximeter.
ii.
Positions of control. The several positions of the control lever shall be mechanically defined, and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable. Possible movement of this control to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be delayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared condition.
d.
Provision for security seals. Adequate provision shall be made for affixing lead-and-wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals.
e.
Distance test methods. To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing a road test.
f.
Tolerance values.
i.
Distance tests. Maintenance and acceptance tolerances for taximeters shall be as follows:
A.
On overregistration, one percent of the interval under test.
B.
On underregistration, four percent of the interval under test, with an added tolerance of one hundred (100) feet or thirty (30) miles whenever the initial interval is included in the interval under test.
ii.
Time tests on individual time intervals. Maintenance and acceptance tolerances on individual time intervals shall be as follows:
A.
On overregistration, three (3) seconds per minute (five (5) percent).
B.
On underregistration, nine (9) seconds per minute (fifteen (15) percent) on the initial interval and six (6) seconds per minute (ten (10) percent) on subsequent intervals.
g.
Time mechanism tests. The time mechanism shall be tested at least through the first five (5) time intervals.
h.
User requirements.
i.
Position and illumination of taximeter. When mounted upon a vehicle, a taximeter shall be so located that its face can be seen by a passenger from the rear compartment of the vehicle. Adequate lighting facilities shall be provided for so illuminating the face of the taximeter that the indications thereof may be conveniently read by the passenger, and the face of the taximeter shall be so illuminated whenever the taximeter is in operation and artificial illumination is necessary for the convenient reading of its indications.
ii.
Statement of rates. The distance and time rates for which a taximeter is adjusted shall be given.
(d)
The regulatory fee shall encompass the fee(s) for inspections performed under this chapter.
(e)

Notwithstanding subsection (d) of this section, should such taxicab fail to appear at the designated location at the designated date, time and location, the provider and/or the driver of such taxicab is subject to a no-show fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
