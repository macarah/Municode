Sec. 6.02. - Effective dates.
(a)
Section 6.01 of this Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval. The remaining provisions of this Act shall become effective on October 30, 2006; provided, however, that the provisions of this Act necessary for the election to be held on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November, 2007, shall be effective upon the certification of the results of such referendum election.
(b)
A period of time will be needed for an orderly transition of various government functions from Fulton County to the City of Chattahoochee Hills. Accordingly, there shall be a transition period beginning December 1, 2007, and ending at midnight on November 30, 2009. During such transition period, all provisions of this Act shall be effective as law, but not all provisions of this Act shall be implemented.
(c)
During such transition period, Fulton County shall continue to provide within the territorial limits of Chattahoochee Hill Country all government services and functions which Fulton County provided in that area as of the date of enactment of this Act, except to the extent otherwise provided in this section; provided, however, that by agreement of Fulton County and the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country responsibility for any such service or function may be transferred to the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country at such time as may be agreed upon by the parties. If this Act is approved as provided for by section 6.01 of this Act, effective December 1, 2007, the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country shall collect taxes, fees, assessments, fines and forfeitures, and other moneys within the territorial limits of Chattahoochee Hill Country; provided, however, that upon at least 30 days' prior written notice to Fulton County by the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country, the authority to collect any tax, fee, assessment, fine, forfeiture, or other moneys shall remain with Fulton County after December 1, 2007, until such time as Fulton County receives subsequent notice from the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country that such authority shall be transferred to the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country. Where a particular tax, fee, assessment, fine, forfeiture, or other amount collected is specifically related to the provision of a particular government service or function by Fulton County, the service or function shall continue to be provided by the county contingent upon payment by the city of the actual cost of providing such service or function unless otherwise provided in a written agreement between the city and the county. Any existing contract for the performance of a governmental service with a private person residing or doing business within the city limits shall not be altered or adversely affected by the establishment of this Act of the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country.

(9)
May generally exercise any power granted by this Act or general law, except to the extent that a power is specifically and integrally related to the provision of a governmental service, function, or responsibility not yet provided or carried out by the city.
(e)
During the transition period, the Municipal Court of Chattahoochee Hill Country shall exercise its jurisdiction to the extent appropriate with respect to the government services and functions performed by the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country and the appropriate court or courts of Fulton County shall retain jurisdiction over the area incorporated as the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country with respect to government services and functions performed by Fulton County. Any transfer of jurisdiction to the City of Chattahoochee Hill Country at the beginning of, during, at the end of, or after the transition period shall not in and of itself abate any judicial proceeding pending in Fulton County or the pending prosecution of any violation of any ordinance of Fulton County.
(f)
During the transition period, the governing authority of Chattahoochee Hill Country may at any time, without the necessity of any agreement by Fulton County, commence to exercise its planning and zoning powers; provided, however, that the city shall give the county at least 30 days' written notice of the date on which the city will assume the exercise of such powers. Upon the governing authority of Chattahoochee Hill Country commencing to exercise its planning and zoning powers, the Municipal Court of Chattahoochee Hill Country shall immediately have jurisdiction to enforce the planning and zoning ordinances of the city. The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions of any other subsection of this section.

Sec. 6.03. - Catchlines.
The catchlines of sections of this Act or any ordinance printed in boldface type, italics, or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section, and:
(1)
Shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections or as any part of the section; and
(2)
Shall not be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted unless expressly provided to the contrary.
Furthermore, the article and section headings contained in this Act shall not be deemed to govern, limit, or modify or in any manner affect the scope, meaning, or intent of the provisions of any article or section hereof.
Sec. 6.04. - Directory nature of dates.
If it is necessary to delay any action called for in this Act for providential cause, delay in securing approval under the federal Voting Rights Act, or any other reason, it is the intention of the General Assembly that the action be delayed rather than abandoned. Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is specifically provided that:
(1)
If it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in section 6.01 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon after such date as is reasonably practicable; and
(2)
If it is not possible to hold the first regular municipal election provided for in section 2.02 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then there shall be a special election for the initial members of the governing authority to be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and the commencement of the initial terms of office shall be delayed accordingly.
Sec. 6.05. - Severability.
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Act, which shall remain of full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
Sec. 6.06. - Repealer.
All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.
