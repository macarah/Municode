Sec. 54-76. - Deficiency or overpayment; late payment; failure to pay or file return.
(a)
Recomputation of tax. If the business license department has a reasonable basis to believe that information on the return or the amount of tax paid is incorrect, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within its possession or that may come into its possession. One or more than one deficiency determination may be made of the amount due for one or more than one period.
(b)
Determination of tax when no return made. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-53.3(b), if any innkeeper fails to file a return and pay the tax as required by this ordinance, the business license department shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the innkeeper, or as the case may be, of the amount of gross rent which is subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the innkeeper failed to file the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the business license department. Upon the basis of this estimate, the business license department shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the county, adding to the sum, per month, from the day after the close of each monthly period for which tax is due until the date of payment, any penalties and interest authorized herein. One or more than one determination may be made for one or for more than one period.
(c)
Interest on deficiency or late payment. The amount of the determination made under subsection (b) of this section (without deduction for the collection allowance authorized in section 54-74 of this article) shall bear interest at a rate of one percent per month (or fraction thereof) from the first day after the close of the prior monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned until the date of payment.
(d)
Penalty on deficiency or late payment. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-58, when an innkeeper fails to make any return or to pay the full amount of the tax required by this article, there shall be imposed, in addition to other penalties provided by law, a penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of five percent of the determination (without deduction for the collection allowance authorized in section 54-74 of this article) or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each 30 days or fraction thereof of delinquency. The penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent of the determination or $25.00 in the aggregate, whichever is greater. Such penalty shall be assessed and paid by the innkeeper to the county. In addition, the innkeeper shall not be entitled to the collection allowance authorized in section 54-74 of this article. The late penalty will be strictly enforced; provided that, if the failure to make a return or to pay the full amount of the tax required is due to providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the business license department in affidavit form attached to the return and remittance is made within ten days of due date, the return may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest.
(e)
Offsetting of overpayments. In making a determination under this section, the business license department may offset overpayment for a period against underpayments for another period, against penalties, and against the interest on underpayments. However, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-51(a)(1)(B), if it is determined by the supervisor that overpayment of tax was made by the occupants to the innkeeper, the entire amount of all overpayments of tax will be made to the business license department without any deduction for the collection allowance provided for in section 54-74 of this article.
(f)
Penalty for fraud or intent to evade tax. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-58(a), in the case of a false or fraudulent return or of a failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the county of any tax due under this article, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due shall be assessed.
(g)
Service of notices. The business license department or its designated representative shall give to the innkeeper written notice of its determination under this section. The notice may be served personally or by mail. If served by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the innkeeper at his/her/its last known address as it appears in the records of the business license department. In case of service by mail of any notice required by this article, the service is complete when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee.
(h)
Time limit for service of notice of deficiency determination. Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this article or authorized rules or regulations, or failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within three years after the fifth day of the calendar month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period expires later.
(i)
Refunds. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under this article, it may be refunded, provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the business license department within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the supervisor. If the claim is approved by the board of commissioners, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts that are due and payable from the innkeeper from which it was collected or by whom it was paid and the balance executors.

Further, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-13-53.1, if any innkeeper becomes liable for any amount under this article and subsequent thereto sells or quits the business, such innkeeper shall make a final return and payment of all tax due within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business. The innkeeper's successors or assignees, if any, shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount due until the former owner produces either a receipt from the business license department showing that the county has been paid the amount due or a certificate stating that no amount is due. In the event said purchaser of the business fails to withhold the required amount from the purchase price as required, the purchaser shall become personally liable for the payment of any taxes, interest, and penalties accruing under this article and unpaid by the former owner or assignor. The personal liability of the purchaser in such a case shall not exceed the amount of the total purchase money, but the property being transferred shall in all cases be subject to the full amount of the tax lien arising from the delinquencies of the former owner. Paid executions may be transferred and enforced as otherwise provided by law.
