Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— The Resolution of Dec. 16, 2010 repealed the former Art III, §§ 66-71—66-84, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to the county cell tower ordinance and derived from Res. of 5-28-2009, §§ 1—14.

Sec. 66-71. - Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed Pickens County's authority concerning the placement construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Pickens County finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character, and environment of the county and its inhabitants. The county also recognizes that the development of wireless service technology can be an asset to the economic development of the county as well as providing significant benefits to the county and its residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the county's land use policies, the county shall adopt a single and comprehensive application and permit process for the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities.
The intent and purpose of this article is to regulate the placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities in a manner which:
(1)
Accommodates the communication, radio, television, and electric generation needs of wireless telecommunication facilities while protecting the health, safety, and welfare of Pickens County and its inhabitants;
(2)
Minimizes the adverse environmental and visual impacts of wireless communication facilities;
(3)
Maximizes the use of existing and approved towers, buildings, or structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunication facilities;
(4)
Avoids potential damage to adjacent properties;
(5)
Minimizes the hazards these facilities pose to birds.
The above shall be accomplished through location, structural, and construction standards accompanied by a comprehensive review of the site location, the design and engineering principles described in the application, as well as the implementation of those design and engineering principles in the placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities in the county.
(Res. of 12-16-2010)
Sec. 66-72. - Severability.
If any word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion of this article or any application thereof to any person or circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional or invalid for any reason then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion, or the proscribed Application thereof, shall be severable and the remaining provisions of this article, and all applications thereof, not having been declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force and effect.
Any permit issued under this article shall be comprehensive and not severable. If part of a permit is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any material respect by a competent authority the permit shall be void in total.

The replacement of any components of a wireless telecommunications facility with identical components and normal repair and maintenance of a wireless telecommunications facility shall not be considered a modification.
Stealth design technology. A wireless telecommunications facility which appropriately models or mimics in size, shape, scale, and color something which exists in the immediate landscape or which could be legally placed there. Examples include silos in a farm setting, trees in forested lands, church steeples, water towers, or other existing tall structures in the vicinity of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility.
Wireless telecommunications facility. Any structure designed for the purposes of promoting wireless telecommunications as contemplated by the Federal Telecommunications Act. Also referred to herein as "facility".
(Res. of 12-16-2010)
Sec. 66-74. - Applicability.
Any and all placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities subsequent to the adoption of this article must receive a permit from the county commissioner before any work can commence on the facility. No permit shall be transferrable between applicants or properties. Permits expire six months from issuance.

Sec. 66-76. - Variances.
If an applicant requests in writing to the county planning and development office a variance to the enforcement of any of the requirements of this article, the county commissioner is authorized to grant a variance if the county planning and development office finds that one or more of the following considerations are present:
(1)
The placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is undertaken by a state or local governmental entity;
(2)
The enforcement of the provisions described in the variance request would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services;
(3)
The enforcement of the provisions described in the variance request would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services;
(4)
There are unusual, exceptional, or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property upon which the placement, construction, and/or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is proposed that do not generally apply to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the property owner's or applicant's own actions. Such conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or particular shape of the property being considered; and as a result of such unusual circumstance or condition, there is an unnecessary hardship or practical consideration which renders the compliance with this article unfairly difficult;
The written request for a variance to the enforcement of any of the requirements of this article shall state with particularity:
(1)
Which provision of this article cannot be complied with;
(2)
Which of the four considerations referenced above are applicable; and
(3)
How the purpose and intent of this article are not in conflict with the variance should it be granted.
The authorization of any variance shall not conflict with the purpose and intent of this article.
In granting a variance, the county commissioner may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the placement, construction, and/or modification of the wireless telecommunications facilities as may be deemed necessary to further the purpose and intent of this article. All requests for variances shall be made with the initial application and shall be considered as part of the application.
