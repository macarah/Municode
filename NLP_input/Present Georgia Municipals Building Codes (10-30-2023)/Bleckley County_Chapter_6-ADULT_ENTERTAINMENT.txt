Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 6-1. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta, College Park, Carrolton, Whitfield County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the county takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in the state.
(b)
Moreover, it is the finding of the sole commissioner that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the county.
(c)
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection.
(d)
Furthermore, it is the finding of the sole commissioner that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors, have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general.
(e)
The county has declared that it is in the best interests of the public health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas.
(f)
The county further declares that nudity and sexually explicit entertainment coupled with alcohol in public places encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare.
(g)
Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the county is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses.
