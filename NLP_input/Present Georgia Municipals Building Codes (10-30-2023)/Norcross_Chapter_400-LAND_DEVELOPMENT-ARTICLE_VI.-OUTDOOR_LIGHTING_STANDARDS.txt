ARTICLE VI. - OUTDOOR LIGHTING STANDARDS

Sec. 406-1. - Purpose.
(a)
These provisions are intended to control the use of outdoor artificial illuminating devices emitting rays into the night sky which have a detrimental effect on astronomical observations. It is the intention of this article to encourage good lighting practices such that lighting systems are designed to reduce or eliminate light pollution, conserve energy and money, while increasing nighttime safety, utility, security and productivity.
(b)
All areas containing outdoor lighting, including but not limited to floodlighting, security lighting, event lighting or the lighting of off-street parking and loading areas shall comply with the requirements of this article.
(c)
Furthermore, it is the intent of the regulations of this article to establish lighting levels for various permitted uses that promote visual surveillance, reduce the potential for criminal activity and prevent the unnecessary glare of light on adjacent properties.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 406-2. - Lighting standards, configuration and timing.
(a)
All exterior lighting shall be of full cutoff design and directed downward and away from adjoining property, with luminaries shielded to prevent unnecessary glare as identified below.

(c)
Security lighting above building entrances, parking lots, off-street loading areas and service entrances shall be metal halide, unless permitted otherwise during plan review, and incorporated in exterior areas going to and from the building(s) or use(s) within the site.
(d)
All exterior fixtures, when used for security purposes, except for parking lot lighting, shall be illuminated from dusk until dawn, unless otherwise specifically designated on the site plan and as approved through the site plan process. All other exterior lighting that is not necessary for security purposes shall be turned off one hour after the close of business.
(e)
Any exterior lighting device designed for security lighting shall be protected by weather and vandal-resistant covering, a managed light source for controlling the times of illumination and fully shielded and directed down to minimize glare and intrusiveness on adjacent properties or rights-of-way.
(f)
Lighting in multi-level parking ramps shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to maximize safety and to minimize unnecessary glare to adjacent or nearby residential areas.
