Credits; Restrictions.
1.
Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(2) below or in a private agreement meeting the definition established in Section 13.16.19, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 10-02-0008].
2.
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the City of Locust Grove Comprehensive Plan, prior to the effective date of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 10-02-0008], is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance [Ordinance No. 10-02-0008], any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of the city of Locust Grove, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area.

In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
B.
Granting of Credits.
1.
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a water and/or sewer impact fee is imposed, provided that:
a.
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the City of Locust Grove Comprehensive Plan;

1.
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
2.
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
3.
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the City of Locust Grove, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
4.
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
5.
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a state of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the mayor and council in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
D.
Credits; Application.

The administrator, in his or her sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit.
3.
Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
E.
Credits; Abandoned Building Permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the city, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
