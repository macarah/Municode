  (d)
Variances to maximum height limitations. The city council may authorize a building or structure to exceed the maximum height limitations for good cause shown, upon application by the owner of the property involved, after a public hearing.
(e)
Height performance standard. This section provides for additional setback protection from visual impacts of taller buildings. The heights of buildings on properties abutting a single-family dwelling, including a manufactured home, shall be limited according to the provisions of this section. When a non-residential building or structure is proposed to be erected on property that abuts property containing one or more single-family dwellings or manufactured homes, the height of the nonresidential building or structure abutting one or more single-family dwellings or manufactured homes shall meet the requirements of this section. The height of a non-residential building or structure on property abutting a single-family dwelling shall not exceed 35 feet; provided, however, that said non-residential building or structure may be increased in height beyond the 35-foot maximum by one foot for every five feet the nonresidential building is setback from the minimum required side or rear building setback, or ten feet from the side or rear property line if no required side or rear yard is established, up to a maximum required setback of 100 feet. (See figure 5.0.A.) The following table provides maximum heights at five-foot increments of building height based on this performance standard.

  (b)
Landscape strip design standards. Landscape strips shall be planted with trees, shrubs, grass, or groundcover, except for those areas that are mulched. Landscaping shall be planted throughout and shall not appear as a single row of plantings. Landscape strips shall not contain structures, accessory uses, parking of any kind, stormwater detention facilities, fences of any kind, patios, or displays of commercial stock. Berms and retaining walls as part of an overall landscaping plan, signs as permitted in this article, driveways required to access the property, pedestrian-oriented facilities, and underground utilities are permitted within the landscape strip.
(c)
Waiver of landscape strip requirements. The front landscape strips required by this section may be waived for lots which abut one or more developed properties on the same side of the street and which contain a structure that is setback less than ten feet from the right-of-way.
(d)
Required buffers. No lot shall hereafter be developed with less than the minimum required buffer along a side or rear property line when abutting property containing a single-family dwelling or manufactured home, for the specific use as shown in table IV.
(e)
Buffer specifications. Any buffer required by this section shall be natural vegetation, undisturbed except for approved access and utility crossings, and replanted where sparsely vegetated, with evergreen trees and/or shrubs to form an opaque screen that will provide a visual buffer throughout all seasons. Buffers shall be designed to provide privacy and security and to give adequate protection to adjacent neighbors from lights, sounds, and other potential nuisances. Buffers shall be planted with landscaping throughout and shall not appear as a single row of plantings. The length of any required buffers shall not extend closer than 15 feet to any public right-of-way in order to preserve vision clearance.
(f)
Structural buffer design standards. When commercial construction abuts residential property, a minimum six-foot tall wooden slat fence must be installed. Fences and walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property and shall be located in such a manner to preserve existing vegetation.
(g)
Reduction of buffer. A required buffer may be reduced by as much as 30 percent through the site plan review process for multifamily, institutional residential living facilities, places of worship, schools, daycare centers, and other institutional uses if screening is provided by installing a minimum six-foot high solid wooden fence or masonry wall within the required buffer.
