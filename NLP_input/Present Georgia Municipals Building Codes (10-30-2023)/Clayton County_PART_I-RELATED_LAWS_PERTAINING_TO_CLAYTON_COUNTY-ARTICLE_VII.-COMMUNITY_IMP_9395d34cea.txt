Sec. 7-5. - Administration, appointment, and election of board members.
(a)
Each district created pursuant hereto shall be administered by a board composed of seven members to be appointed and elected as hereinafter provided. One board member shall be appointed by the Clayton County board of commissioners if any portion of the district lies within the unincorporated areas of Clayton County, one board member shall be appointed by the governing authority of each municipality within which the district is now or hereafter partially located if any portion of the district lies within the incorporated area of such municipality, and the remaining board members shall be elected by the owners of the real property within the district subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. The appointed board members shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed same, respectively. The initial elected board members shall serve for terms of office as follows: one-half thereof, or one less than half if an odd number, shall serve for two years, and the remaining board members shall serve for four years. Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for four years, except the appointed members who serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed them.
(b)
The initial board members to be elected as provided herein shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the Clayton County board of commissioners, or governing body of the municipality if the district lies wholly within the incorporated area thereof, shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Clayton County as hereinafter provided. Thereafter, there shall be conducted biennially, not later than 60 days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Clayton County, a caucus of said electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those positions which have terms expiring or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereafter, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice of said election shall be given the electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Clayton County on four dates, at least 45 days, 31 days, 17 days, and ten days, respectively, prior to such election.
(c)
The elected board members shall be subject to recall as any other elected public official by the electors hereinabove defined.
(d)
Board members, including appointed board members, shall be electors within the district. If a board member ceases to be an elector, such board member's position shall be declared vacant as of the date of the event terminating such status.
(e)
The board members shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. They shall elect one of their members as chairman and another as vice-chairman and shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer or a secretary-treasurer, either of whom may but need not be a member of the board.
(f)
If the boundaries of a district are subsequently changed after creation of the district to include land within a municipality which was not a party to the creation of the district, or if a municipality's boundaries are changed to include land within a then existing district, the governing authority of the municipality shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 7-9. If the boundaries of a district or a municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County, the Clayton County board of commissioners shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 7-9. The new appointed board member in such cases shall take office upon the vacation of the first elected board member's office to be vacated, by expiration of term, death, resignation, or recall, and that office shall thereafter be appointed by such governing authority. If by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County or within a municipality, respectively, then upon such occurrence the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member and such member shall thereafter be elected as otherwise herein provided.
(g)
O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq., the "Georgia Election Code," shall not apply to the election of district board members. Should a vacancy in office occur of a district board member, and the regular caucus of electors be more than six months in the future, a special election shall be called to fill such vacancy, unless filled by appointment as hereinabove required. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent herewith to provide for any matter concerning such elections.
(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 5)
Sec. 7-6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed one percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board upon the properties shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Clayton County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Clayton County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Clayton County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Clayton County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Clayton County or the municipality which collects same, to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 6)
Sec. 7-7. - Boundaries of the districts.
(a)
The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Clayton County board of commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in section 7-4, or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided.
(b)
The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:

(3)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and

(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 8)
Sec. 7-9. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant hereto shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of Clayton County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Clayton County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Clayton County or any such municipality shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior court of Clayton County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(h)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear, and the principal amount and maturities of such bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the attorney general, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the districts, or in notices of proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other project; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 12)
