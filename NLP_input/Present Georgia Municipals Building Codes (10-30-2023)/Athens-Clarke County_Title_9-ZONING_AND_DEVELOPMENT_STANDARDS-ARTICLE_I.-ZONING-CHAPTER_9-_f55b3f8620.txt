(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-2. - Purpose.
These regulations are designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Athens-Clarke County, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas within Athens-Clarke County so as to protect the welfare, safety, character and integrity of residential neighborhoods and the overall community; provide the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities to serve the residents of Athens-Clarke County; protect the environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunication facilities; minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications towers and antennas; maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout Athens-Clarke County; maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures and co-location of antennas as a primary option rather than construction of single use towers; provide for location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned residential; and provide for the removal of all towers and antennas that are either abandoned or fail to meet the requirements set forth in these regulations.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-3. - Registration required.
In order to provide the governing authority with accurate and current information concerning the telecommunications providers who offer or provide wireless telecommunications services within Athens-Clarke County or who own or operate telecommunications facilities within Athens Clarke County; to assist the governing authority in enforcement of the zoning ordinance of Athens Clarke County; to assist the governing authority in the collection and enforcement of any fees or charges that may be due Athens-Clarke County; and to assist the governing authority in monitoring compliance with local, state, and federal laws, all owners of telecommunications towers and/or antennas that offer or provide any telecommunications service within Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, from telecommunications facilities within Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, shall register with the Athens-Clarke County Planning Department for a registration fee of $30.00, on forms to be provided by the Athens-Clarke County Planning Department, which form shall include the following:

Any loss of use, increase in use, or change in use of existing antennas or towers must be reported at the time the change occurs; and
G.
Such other information as the Athens-Clarke County governing authority may reasonably require; and
H.
Failure to register as required and to truthfully report all information required in the annual registration shall be an offense and a conviction for violation thereof shall be punished as provided in section 1-1-5 of the Code of Athens-Clarke County.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-4. - Exclusions.
A.
The following will be exempt from these regulations:
1.
Any tower and antenna less than 70 feet in total height and owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or any receive only antenna designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multi-channel multipoint distribution services or direct broadcast satellite service;
2.
Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by Athens-Clarke County and used for governmental purposes unless otherwise directed by the local governing authority and further provided that a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-5. - Placement by zoning district.
A.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be authorized in the zoning districts of the zoning ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, as follows:
1.
Not permitted. Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, or in subsection (2) and (3) below, telecommunications towers or antennas shall not be permitted in residential districts RS-25, RS-15, RS-8, RS-5, RM-1, RM-2 and RM-3; the Airport Hazard Overlay District (A); the Commercial-Downtown (C-D); or towers along any corridors described below:
a.
Properties that have any "C" District and front the following streets: Alps Road, Barnett Shoals Road, Baxter Street, Boulevard, Cedar Shoals Drive, North Chase Street, South Chase Street, College Station Road, Danielsville Road, Epps Bridge Parkway, Gaines School Road, Hawthorne Avenue, Jennings Mill Road, Lexington Road, North Lumpkin Street, South Lumpkin Street, North Milledge Avenue, South Milledge Avenue, Milledge Circle, North Avenue, Peter Street, South Peter Street, Prince Avenue, Timothy Road, Whitehead Road unless the tower is a monopole at least 200 feet from the roadway and separated from other towers at least 1200 feet in all directions.
2.
Permitted uses. The placement and installation of towers and antennas are specifically permitted without a special use permit by application for a building permit pursuant to the provisions of subsection h., as follows:
a.
Towers and antennas up to 300 feet in total height will be permitted in the Industrial District (I), upon application for a building permit.
b.
Monopole towers and antennas up to 100 feet in total height will be permitted in the Commercial General (C-G) zoning district upon application for a building permit. Provided that such tower and antenna are set back at least a distance of the total height of the tower plus 400 feet in all directions from any single-family residential districts or historic districts or landmarks, as measured radially from the tower base to the district boundaries; also provided that the design of the monopole tower shall be compatible with the surrounding area. It is the intent of this requirement to make all monopole towers as unobtrusive as possible; therefore, alternative tower structures designed to camouflage with the surrounding area shall be preferred options.
c.
Antennas attached to buildings will be permitted in the RM-1 or RM-2 district; provided, however, that antennas will add no more than 20 feet to the height of the building and will be installed on any building in such a way as to minimize the visual impact of the installation from public streets to the absolute minimum; to minimize visual impacts of the antenna from habitable living areas of residential units which directly face the antenna within 100 feet horizontal distance; if back up equipment is installed on any roof, the back up facility shall be low-lying and set back or otherwise located to minimize visibility, especially from public places and from the street; and no building-mounted antenna shall extend more than four horizontal feet from the building;
d.
In any nonresidential district, installation of an antenna on any existing towers, buildings, alternative tower structures, or other existing structure such as a sign, light pole, water tower, or similar freestanding structure of any height, so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing tower, building or structure. Such specific permitted use shall also include the placement of any additional building or other supporting equipment used in connection with the antenna; provided, however, the additional building or equipment shall be consistent in type of exterior material and quality of design and construction with any other building on the premises and provided the number and location of antennas, or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views.
e.
Monopole towers (or alternative tower structures of stealth design) and antennas no greater than 100 feet in total height along the protected corridors set forth in subsection A.1., provided the tower and antenna is setback from said roadways at least 200 feet and is separated from all other towers at least 1200 feet in all directions. Antennas on existing structures will be permitted along the protected corridors in the manner described in subparagraph A.2.d. above.
f.
Installation of a temporary telecommunications tower for a period not to exceed 90 days shall be allowed in any nonresidential district provided height does not exceed district requirements and provided the temporary tower is setback from any protected corridors set forth in subsection A.1. a distance of at least 200 feet from the road right-of-way. A temporary permit, however, must be obtained.
g.
An applicant for a permitted use may request deviation from the standards in this subsection in accordance with chapter 9-21 of the zoning Ordinance.
h.
Any person aggrieved by any decision to deny a building permit or by any Athens-Clarke County official having authority over the issuance of building permits may appeal following the procedure below:
If a request for an administrative hearing is received within five business days of the decision, an appeal hearing shall be scheduled for the next regular hearing calendar before the hearings board, allowing an adequate notice period, subject to all of the requirements of the Type IV procedure, except that the notice procedure shall be the same as for a staff permit. The hearings board's decision shall be in writing based on substantial evidence contained in a written record.
3.
Special use. Except as provided for in subsections A.1. and A.2., the placement and installation of all towers and antennas shall be special uses in the following zoning districts:
a.
Towers and antennas greater than 300 feet in total height in the Industrial (I) and Employment-Industrial (E-I) Districts;
b.
Towers and antennas in Agricultural/Residential District (AR) and Employment-Office (E-O) Districts;
c.
Monopole towers and antennas more than 100 feet in total height in the Commercial General (C-G) zone;
d.
Monopole towers and antennas in Commercial Office (C-O) or Commercial Neighborhood (C-N).
4.
Prohibitions. No new cell may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new cell is to serve. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna.
5.
Preferred location sites. Any telecommunications towers being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication and any existing structure shall be a preferred location site for antenna where located within RM or nonresidential districts; provided, however, that locations which meet these criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this section.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-6. - General provisions.
A.
The following provisions are applicable to all towers and antennas regardless of location unless context limits application to towers only:
1.
Landscaping and maintenance. Except for monopole not exceeding 100 feet in height, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent properties. As such, a landscaping buffer consisting of evergreen material that is at least six feet in height, xeriscape (drought) tolerant, or irrigated, shall be planted on all sides of the site. Said landscaping plan shall be submitted to the planning department when the building permit is applied for. Said buffer shall be maintained and any loss of vegetation within the buffer shall be replaced by the applicant. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may provide a sufficient buffer. Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. The landscaping maintenance set forth herein shall be a required condition for approval of the annual operating permit. No more than two parking spaces per facility shall be allowed, and a ten-foot-wide turnaround drive with an all-weather surface shall be required if parking spaces are provided.
2.
Lighting. Towers and antennas shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding area and views, or the tower shall use a dual lighting system consisting of a strobe light during the day and a slow flashing red light at night unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
3.
Removal of abandoned towers and antennas. After a continuous period of 12 months during which an antenna or tower is not used for its original purpose, it shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from Athens-Clarke County notifying the owner of such abandonment. The owner may request a three-month extension prior to the end of the 12-month period. Said three-month extension may be granted administratively by the planning department if the request is received in writing by the planning department prior to the end of the 12-month period. If a three-month grace period is granted, then a notice of abandonment will be given to the owner at the end of the three-month period. If any abandoned antenna or tower is not removed by the owner within said 90 days after notice of abandonment, then the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective for the tower until all users cease using the tower. Within 30 days of the owner's receipt of said notice of abandonment, any owner aggrieved by said notice of abandonment may file a written request for a hearing before the hearings board pursuant to chapter 9-4 of the Code of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.
In addition, prior to the issuance of any tower construction permit, the applicant shall submit security for the costs of removal of the structure in an amount estimated by the applicant and approved by the building official as sufficient to cover the costs of removal. Such security may be in the form of:
a.
An 18-month security bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, payable to Athens-Clarke County; the security bond shall be renewed at the time the annual operating permit is renewed in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of removal at the time of renewal. Such renewal bond must be approved by the building official.
b.
A deposit of cash with Athens-Clarke County or an escrow of any other instrument readily convertible to cash at face value with a financial institution; and in case of an escrow account, the bank with which the funds are deposited, being subject to the approval of Athens-Clarke County. In the case of an escrow account, the applicant shall file with Athens-Clarke County an agreement between the financial institution and the applicant specifying the funds that are in the escrow account shall be held in trust until released by Athens-Clarke County and may not be used or pledged by the applicant as security in any other matter during that period and that, in the case of the applicant's failure to remove the tower and antennas in accordance with the terms set forth above, then the bank shall immediately make the funds available to Athens-Clarke County for use of completion of the removal of the structure. Said deposit of cash shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal.
c.
A letter of credit from a financial institution in a form approved by Athens-Clarke County providing that the financial institution does guarantee funds in an amount equal to the aforementioned cost of removal and that in the event the applicant fails to remove the structure in accordance with the terms set forth above, the financial institution shall pay to Athens-Clarke County immediately and without further action, such funds as necessary to finance the removal of the structure up to the amount specified in the letter of credit. Such amount shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal.
4.
Setbacks and separation. All property necessary to satisfy the setback requirements set forth herein covering the total height of the tower shall be under the ownership or control of the applicant. The requirement for control may be satisfied by lease or easement approved by the local governing authority. Multiple towers on the same site are allowed provided they meet all setback and separation requirements. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers.
a.
Freestanding towers must be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from adjacent property lines, as measured radially from the base of tower to the property line of the subject property; and
b.
Freestanding towers must also be set back from all single and two-family residential districts and historic districts or historic landmarks, a distance of the total height of the tower plus 400 feet in all directions, as measured radially from the base of the tower to the district boundaries or landmark boundaries; and
c.
Guy wires and accessory facilities associated with towers must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for buildings.
d.
All lattice or guy-wired towers constructed after the effective date of this section shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements as set out in chart form below. Antennas mounted on rooftops, monopole towers, or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances as set out in chart form below. Except in the industrial district, monopole towers shall be separated from any other tower at least a distance equal to twelve hundred feet in all directions. In the Industrial District the separation distance between monopole towers shall equal the height of the tallest tower adjacent to the monopole tower. All freestanding towers which are alternative in design (stealth design) shall be separated from any other towers a minimum distance of the height of the tallest tower to which it is adjacent.

  5.
Tower color. The color of the tower shall be either painted gray or left in its natural gray metallic state unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
6.
Insurance. Commercial general liability insurance shall be required with combined single limits of liability coverage of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence, for bodily injury and property damages, with respect to the construction, use of the property, maintenance, operation, or other liabilities associated with a telecom-
munication tower. An adequately funded self-insurance program will be considered as a substitute for commercial insurance, if approved and subject to any condition imposed by the governing authority.
7.
Federal and state requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and any other agency of the federal government or state government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the compliance schedule mandated by the controlling federal or state agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna by the owner or by the local governing authority at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in subsection (A)(3) above.
8.
Building codes and safety standards. To insure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the latest edition of the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. A professional engineer shall certify that all antennas, towers, and wireless telecommunications equipment are erected and installed so as to comply with said codes and standards.
9.
Security fence. All towers shall have a security fence of not less than six feet in height with anti-climbing devices on the fence. A sign no larger than four square feet in size shall be placed on the security fence or other outermost structural element of the telecommunication facility; which sign shall state the name and telephone number of a person responsible for the safety and maintenance of said facility. No other signs, symbols, or advertisements shall be allowed on the security fence or on any monopole, tower, or antenna.
10.
Noise. The intensity level of sound from the wireless telecommunications facility, including temporary generators used during power outages, measured at the property line of abutting property zoned for residential use shall not at any time exceed 70 decibels from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 55 decibels from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.; and abutting property zoned for nonresidential use the same shall not exceed 80 decibels at any time.
11.
Maintenance of telecommunication facilities. Towers must be properly and routinely maintained in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state and local requirements. Estimated life of construction must be included in submittal information. The owner shall provide the Athens-Clarke County Building Inspection Department with a certified copy of the engineer's inspection report, which includes, but is not limited to, the condition of the grounding system, the structural integrity of the facility, any damage incurred over the past year, the condition of the bolts, and a plan to correct any deficiencies. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communications towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to Athens-Clarke County Building Inspections Department. If, upon inspection, the Athens-Clarke County Building Inspections Department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days from the date of the mailing of such notice, to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in subsection A.3. above.
12.
Fire prevention. All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and operated in such a manner so as to minimize the risk of igniting a fire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs. To this end all of the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunication facilities when determined necessary by the fire marshal. Demonstration of compliance with requirements "a" through "e" listed below shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by the fire marshal on the building plans submitted.
a.
At least one-hour fire-resistant interior surfaces shall be used in the construction of all building;
b.
Monitored automatic fire extinguishing systems approved by the fire marshal shall be installed in all equipment buildings and enclosures;
c.
Rapid entry (KNOX) systems shall be installed as required by the fire marshal;
d.
Type and location of vegetation and other materials within ten feet of the facility and all new structures, including telecommunication towers, shall have review for fire safety purposes by the fire marshal. Requirements established by the fire marshal shall be followed; and
e.
All tree trimmings and trash generated by construction of the facility shall be removed from the property and properly disposed of prior to building permit finalization or commencement of operation, whichever comes first.
13.
Co-location. Each telecommunications tower application shall be required by affidavit of the applicant to make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below:
a.
The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height necessary to accommodate the applicant's antenna. Such contact shall be by certified mail/return receipt requested. The applicant shall provide a list of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, the form and content of such contact, and a copy of the return receipt of the certified mail.
b.
The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted:
(1)
Identification of the site by location, tax map and parcel number, existing uses on or adjacent to the site, and tower height;
(2)
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna;
(3)
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required;
(4)
If structurally able, would shared use on such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing tower or antenna(s) or the proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed antenna, if at all; and
(5)
If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use.
c.
Such request shall be made at least one month prior to the filing of an application for a building permit or special use. Responses to such request shall also be included.
(1)
Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the response of such owner is filed, or in the case of a failure to respond, proof of the applicant's attempted contact with the correct owner to the correct address by certified mail/return receipt requested is filed by the applicant.
(2)
The governing authority shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner.
(3)
Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the application cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
d.
The governing authority may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee for shared use and the costs to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. Shared use is not precluded simply based on fee and cost structures, unless found to be unreasonable by the local governing authority.
If the owner of an approved or pre-existing tower refuses to allow co-location, an affidavit shall be required that states the reason for the refusal. An unreasonable refusal by the owner of a tower to allow for co-location not supported by the required engineering evidence shall be a reason for the governing authority to refuse to renew the annual operating permit of said approved or pre-existing tower.
In addition, evidence submitted by the applicant based on a report by a certified engineer to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna shall be required and shall consist of the following:
(1)
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
(2)
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
(3)
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
(5)
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure are in excess of the cost of new tower development and location to the extent that co-location would impose a significant financial burden on the applicant;
(6)
The applicant demonstrates there are other limiting factors that render existing towers or structures unsuitable.
If co-location on an existing tower or structure is not possible as set forth above, and a new tower is deemed appropriate, then the new tower must be constructed to allow co-location of antennas and the applicant must agree to accommodate the co-location of other antennas on the new tower, according to the following: for towers up to 100 feet in height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least two users; for towers up to 125 feet in total height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three users; and for towers more than 125 feet in height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four users, unless the proposed tower is an alternative tower structure of stealth design.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-18-7. - Procedures for special use permits.
A.
The following provisions shall govern the application for and consideration of special use permits for towers and antennas:
1.
Special use permits shall be applied for and considered in accordance with Type II procedures under Chapter 9-4 of the zoning ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. When appropriate in achieving the purposes of this section, the governing authority may waive or reduce any requirements or standards during the special use process. Athens-Clarke County shall make a final decision on an application for a special use pursuant to this section within a reasonable time. In determining a reasonable time, 150 days from the date of filing a complete application by the applicant shall be considered presumptively reasonable. Athens-Clarke County shall have 30 days from the date of filing of the application to review the application for completeness. The time it takes for an applicant to respond to a request for additional information will not count toward the 150 days only if Athens-Clarke County notifies the applicant within the first 30 days that its application is incomplete. The presumptively reasonable time period may be extended beyond 150 days by mutual written consent of the applicant and the Planning Director.
2.
Additional fees shall be charged to cover the actual cost to the local government of obtaining expert opinion and studies in reviewing applications for special use. The initial deposit for such additional fees shall cover a minimum of ten hours of an expert consultant's hourly rate to provide consultation to Athens-Clarke County. If the actual cost to the government is greater than the initial deposit, the applicant shall be billed for the difference and shall pay the bill in full prior to the hearing before the mayor and commission. If the actual cost to the government is less than the initial deposit, the actual cost will be deducted from the initial deposit and the remainder of the deposit will be refunded to the applicant within ten working days following the hearing before the mayor and commission. In addition to the requirements of chapter 9-20, the planning staff shall provide to the planning commission substantial evidence contained in a written record in support of the planning staff's written recommendation regarding the petition for consideration by the planning commission at its regularly scheduled meeting. In addition to the requirements of chapter 9-20, the planning commission's written recommendation to the mayor and commission shall be based on substantial evidence contained in a written record provided to the mayor and commission.
3.
Any engineering information, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, that an applicant submits shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer.
4.
If an environmental assessment is required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a copy of the assessment, as well as documentation of the FCC's subsequent approval thereof, must be submitted at the time of application. In addition, the applicant shall be required to submit documentation that the proposed wireless telecommunications facility complies with current Federal Communications Commission standards for radio frequency emissions, as adopted by the FCC at the time of application.
5.
In considering a special use permit, the governing authority may impose conditions, to the extent necessary, to minimize any adverse effects the proposed tower or antenna may have on the adjoining properties if after considering all of the factors required, the governing authority decides conditions can reduce such adverse impacts upon adjoining properties to an acceptable and reasonable level.
6.
The governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit; provided, however, the governing authority may consider additional factors if the governing authority concludes that the goals of this section are better served thereby:
a.
Height and setbacks of the proposed antenna and tower;
b.
Proximity of the antenna and tower to other structures and zoning district boundaries;
c.
Nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d.
Surrounding topography;
e.
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f.
Design of the antenna or tower, with particular reference to design features that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
g.
Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers or other structures for antenna co-location;
h.
Proximity of the antenna or tower to other antennas or towers;
i.
Impact of the tower and antenna upon scenic views and upon visual quality of surrounding areas; and
j.
Such other and additional standards of review as set forth in chapter 9-20 concerning special uses, of the zoning ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia.
7.
Any decision to deny a special use permit shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. No decision to deny a special use permit for a wireless telecommunications tower or antenna shall be based either on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent such facilities comply with the Federal Communications Commission's regulations concerning such emissions or solely on the fact that wireless service is available from other service providers in Athens-Clarke County. A decision to deny a special use permit based on the availability of adequate co-location opportunities is not a decision based solely on the presence of other service providers in Athens-Clarke County.
8.
Public notice for location of towers. In addition to the requirements of chapter 9-20 and chapter 9-4 of the Athens-Clarke County Zoning Ordinance, the following additional public noticing shall be provided for towers more than 150 feet in total height to be located within 1200 feet of any residential district: at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the required public hearing, the applicant shall cause to be floated from the proposed tower site a balloon of the standard size used in aerial line of sight surveys. Said balloon shall be floated to the height of the proposed tower for a period of three days during a five-day business week period so that the visibility of the tower from locations surrounding the proposed tower site can be viewed by the public prior to the required hearing. In addition, the required legal notices shall explain the presence of and the purpose of said balloon. The applicant shall also provide to the planning department the names and addresses on stamped envelopes of all abutting property owners and all owners of residentially zoned parcels lying in whole or in part within a distance of 1200 feet of the proposed tower as measured from the base of the tower to the subject property lines. The owners of record shall be as shown on the Athens-Clarke County Tax Commissioner's records. The planning department shall use the addressed and stamped envelopes to send a letter by regular mail giving notice of the public hearing and of the purpose of the balloon. After the three-day period required herein, the balloon shall be taken down permanently by the applicant. In addition, during the three-day period the balloon shall be taken down every day at sunset and refloated at sunrise.
The planning department, in addition to meeting the posting requirements for special use required by the zoning ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, shall also post the purpose of the balloon. Said sign shall be erected, in a conspicuous location, on or adjacent to the proposed tower site.
The applicant shall also provide for inspection by the public at the planning department, a computer simulated study of any proposed tower more than 100 feet in total height, showing a view of the tower taken from any adjacent residential or historic properties, from any adjacent roads, and from all sides of the tower at a distance of 600 feet from the base of the tower.

In determining a reasonable time period, 90 days from the date of filing a complete application by the applicant shall be considered presumptively reasonable. Athens-Clarke County shall have 30 days from the date of filing of the application to review the application for completeness.

All wireless telecommunication facilities must obtain an operating permit on or before April 1 of each calendar year. The operating permit shall be issued by the planning department after written application to the operating permit officer on a form to be supplied by the planning department. Any change in the five-year buildout plan must be submitted with the application for the operating permit. Within 90 days of receiving a complete application for a renewal permit, the planning department shall issue a written determination granting or denying the operating permit in whole or in part, based on the applicant's compliance with the requirements of this Code section. If the application is denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for denial.
No operating permit shall be renewed until any ongoing violations or defaults in the permittee's performance under the requirements of this chapter have been cured, or a plan detailing the corrective actions to be taken by the permittee has been approved by the planning department.
The fee for the operating permit shall be $100.00 annually for each operating permit issued pursuant to this section and shall be submitted with the application for the operating permit. The fee for the operating permit is intended to reimburse the local governing authority for costs in connection with reviewing, inspecting, and supervising performance under this Code section.
In order to provide the local governing authority with current information concerning nonconforming towers and in order to enforce the provisions of this section that will apply to nonconforming towers upon adoption of this section, the owners of nonconforming towers shall be required to obtain an annual operating permit at the time the structure becomes nonconforming by adoption of this section.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)

All pre-existing towers that do not satisfy the requirements of this chapter shall be considered nonconforming uses and/or structures, according to the provisions of section 9-15-8 of the Zoning Ordinance of Athens-Clarke County. All nonconforming towers shall be subject to the standards set forth in section 9-18-6 A.3., 6., 7., 8., 10., 11., and 13. at the time of adoption of this section. Any unreasonable refusal by an owner of a nonconforming tower to allow for co-location as set forth in section 9-18-6 A.13. shall be cause for revocation of the annual operating permit for the nonconforming tower.
If an additional antenna is co-located upon a pre-existing tower after the adoption of this section, then fencing and landscaping requirements of section 9-18-6 A.1. and A.9. shall be met as part of the permitting process.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the zoning ordinance, for the purposes of this subsection, abandonment of the nonconforming use or structure shall occur if the tower is not used for telecommunication purposes at any time.

Sec. 9-18-12. - Coordination with federal law.
Whenever the governing authority finds that the application of this chapter would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless telecommunication services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless telecommunication services, a special use permit waiving any of the provisions of this chapter may be granted. Any decision by the local governing authority to deny a request pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. If a final decision by Athens-Clarke County is not made within 90 days after the date of filing a complete application for co-location of antennas under this chapter or within 150 days of the date of filing any other complete applications under this chapter, then the applicant may file a claim for relief in court as provided by federal law within 30 days of the expiration of the 90 days or of the 150 days, whichever is applicable.
