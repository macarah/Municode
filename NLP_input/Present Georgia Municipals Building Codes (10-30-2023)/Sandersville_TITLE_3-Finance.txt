At the time of registration, the operator shall indicate that he is permitted to make quarterly sales tax returns together with month and day said quarterly returns are due. The failure of the operator to indicate that he is permitted under applicable state statute to file quarterly reports will infer that monthly reports are due and collectable.
At the time any such report is due, the operator shall file a copy of the corresponding state sales tax return for the sole purpose of verifying the sums reported and due.
In the event an operator is permitted under applicable state guidelines to file annual excise, or lodging tax returns, to the State of Georgia, said operator is required to file monthly or quarterly returns for lodging tax to the City.

(e)
The estimated tax together with applicable penalties and interest may be collected utilizing any of the enforcement methods set forth in this chapter.
Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the City by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten (10) days of the due date, such return may be accepted.
Waiving of penalty and interest; authority. O.C.G.A. § 48-2-41, relating to the authority to waive interest, and O.C.G.A. § 48-2-43, relating to the authority to waive penalty, shall apply; provided, however, that the governing authority shall stand in lieu of the Georgia Commissioner of Revenue, and the City shall stand in lieu of the State.
