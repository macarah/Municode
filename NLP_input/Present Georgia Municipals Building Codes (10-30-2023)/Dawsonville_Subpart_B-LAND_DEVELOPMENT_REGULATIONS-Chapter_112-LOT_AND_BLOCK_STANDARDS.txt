ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS

ARTICLE III. - LAYOUT

Sec. 112-30. - Length to width ratio.
In general, lots should be designed such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building set back line.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-31. - Side lot lines.
In so far as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for at least 30 feet on a dedicated public street unless the lot upon which the building permit is requested is an approved lot in an approved planned unit development.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-32. - Property markers.
Iron pins (½-inch in diameter) shall be installed by a registered land surveyor at all lot corners. The iron pins shall be shown on the final plat.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-33. - Corner lots.
Corner lots shall have extra width to permit prescribed set-back limits from all streets on which the lot has frontage.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-34. - Double frontage lots.
Double frontage lots other than corner lots shall be required for residential subdivisions along arterial or primary collector streets where internal access can be provided. When approved by the planning and zoning commission, double frontage lots can be used.
To properly separate residential subdivisions employing double frontage lots from traffic arteries, the planning and zoning commission will require a planted buffer of ten-foot minimum width along the lot line abutting the traffic artery. The easement for the buffer will be required to deny right of access to the lot on which it is located.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-35. - Panhandle or flag lots.
Panhandle or flag lots, of required width and area, may be allowed where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 30 feet wide, and the panhandle access shall not be more than 200 feet long. Not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other, and if so combined the width of each panhandle may be reduced to not less than 24 feet. All such access points or combinations thereof shall be separated from each other by the frontage of a standard lot required under the applicable provisions of these regulations.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-36. - Lot remnants.
Lot remnants are not permitted. All lots less than minimum lot size which are left over after the subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. However, the lot remnants may be used for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided appropriate maintenance and ownership are clearly designated and abide by regulations set forth in Subpart B, land development regulations, appendix A, zoning, article XIV, PCS, planned conservation subdivision districts, for open space. The remnant lots shall have access to a roadway through right-of-way or permanent easement.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-37. - Subdivision buffers.
Each parcel that is being subdivided into more than four parcels shall have a minimum 20-foot wide vegetation buffer, where natural vegetation exists. Where no natural vegetation exists, a landscape strip with evergreen trees and a solid wooden fence of six feet in height shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of the original parcel.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-38. - Drainage easements.
Each proposed lot shall have a ten-foot drainage easement on all sides of the lot.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-39. - Blocks.

The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to:
(1)
Maximum length of block shall be 1,800 feet.
(2)
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
(3)
Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
(4)
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(5)
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
(b)
The planning and zoning commission may, when existing or proposed pedestrian/bicycle circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian/bicycle ways or access easements through blocks.
(Ord. of 7-15-2019, § 1)
Sec. 112-40. - Street and subdivision names.
