Sec. 55-25. - Permitted encroachments.
(a)
Driveways. Driveways (including paved, masonry, asphalt, etc.) are permitted to encroach on the right-of-way. A driveway permit shall be required and the lot owner shall secure permission for any new driveway from the community development department. Driveways must meet sight distance requirements of community development department, and must be constructed in compliance with county requirements for stormwater drainage/piping and include a hard, permanent surface (concrete or asphalt).
(b)
Landscaping. Limited landscaping is permitted in the county right-of-way, including grass, flowers and shrubs not in excess of two feet in height. Trees shall not be planted in the right-of-way. Irrigation systems shall not be installed in the right-of-way.
(c)
Mailbox support structures. The county permits limited encroachment of the right-of-way for mailbox support structures, which meet the following standards:
(1)
The use of massive mailbox support structures that, when struck, could damage vehicles and cause serious injury to vehicle occupants are prohibited. Heavy metal posts, concrete posts, brick bases, and miscellaneous items such as farm equipment or supports filled with concrete are also prohibited and cannot be used for mailbox supports.
(2)
Acceptable mailbox supports include: a) a single four-inch by four-inch or four-inch diameter wooden post; b) a metal post with strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel hollow pipe; or c) other support of no greater strength, as approved by the road department, as in accordance with the standards of the AASHTO Roadway Design Guidelines for mailbox structures, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event the property owner has any question as to whether the proposed mailbox support will be permitted, the community development department should be consulted.
(3)
Mailbox supports must be embedded no more than 24 inches into the ground. A metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plate, but it may have an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten inches below the ground surface.
(4)
Mailboxes. The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if a vehicle strikes the installation. The mailbox itself should be of lightweight steel, wood, or plastic/composite construction, and meeting U.S. Postal Service regulations.
(d)
Driveways. New driveways for single family residences tying into existing Bartow County roads must receive a driveway permit from the community development department prior to constructing a driveway. The applicant shall submit information on a form issued by the community development department regarding the location, proposed size and construction, and other relevant information. New driveways on commercial or industrial or other non-residential developments shall be approved through the permit process for the engineering department. If a new commercial or industrial or other non-residential development is of a type that does not require engineering department approval, the applicant shall still require a driveway permit prior to construction.
(e)
Utility work. The county permits utilities to encroach in the right-of-way subject to the terms of the Bartow County Utility Accommodation Ordinance. Such work shall require issuance of surety to secure performance of the work and a warranty and maintenance period, as stated in that ordinance.
(f)
Projects tying into Bartow County rights-of-way. New developments that tie into existing Bartow County road rights-of-way are permitted, with the permission of the community development department. Approval is given as a part of the approval process through the engineering department under the development regulations. If any new construction or development requires tying into a county road but does not require a land disturbance permit or any development approval from the engineering department, the applicant must submit plans to the community development department prior to beginning construction and secure a permit. In all cases, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a Bartow County right-of-way without a surety.
(g)
Permitted improvement of existing Bartow County roads. In certain circumstances, a developer or other party may be permitted or required to improve Bartow County roads. In such circumstances, the plans typically shall be approved through the engineering department and a surety posted in accordance with the development regulations for work in an existing county right-of-way. The amount of the surety shall be sufficient to pay for the project, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls. In the event the development does not require approval through the engineering department, a permit shall be secured through the community development department. In all cases where work is performed in a Bartow County right-of-way, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a Bartow County right-of-way without a surety.
(h)
Surety to county. Prior to issuance of an approval to work in a Bartow County right-of-way, except as otherwise approved under the utility accommodation ordinance, the party seeking to perform the work shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit. The surety must be accepted and approved by the community development department before any permit can issue. In the event the work in the right-of-way is related to a development approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements of the Bartow County Development Regulations (which are essentially identical to the requirements below) shall control, and the surety shall be administered by the county engineer. However, if the project is not approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements below shall apply, and the surety shall be administered by the community development department.
(1)
Purpose. The purpose of the surety shall be the following: 1) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way (whether road improvement, tying into an existing right-of-way or other purpose); 2) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any work in any existing county right-of-way.
(2)
Approval. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by Bartow County. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by Bartow County prior to issuance. Bartow County has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the community development department prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing such letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in Bartow County, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. Bartow County reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from an applicant that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. Bartow County reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Escrow shall mean deposit of good funds in a bank of Bartow County's choosing pursuant to escrow instructions issued by Bartow County.
(3)
Scope. In each case, the surety guarantees that all applicable provisions of any Bartow County Ordinances are complied with, including but not limited to, the Bartow County Development Regulations, the Utility Accommodation Ordinance, Bartow County Standard Road Details, and the regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing.
(4)
Amount and term. The amount of the surety depends on the project, and shall be set by the community development department relying on experience with similar projects and the applicant, knowledge of material and labor costs, and investigation of additional costs. The amount shall be sufficient to secure performance of the work and compliance with the county ordinances and regulations. For work in existing county rights-of-way (whether improving existing roads, tying into existing roads, or other purposes), the amount of surety shall be sufficient to ensure repair the roads after any planned work, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls, that are part of the project being approved; the minimum amount shall be $25,000.00. The foregoing amount is a minimum and can be increased based on a more complex or expensive project, difficult terrain or other factors that would make the remedial work more expensive. No additional separate amount of surety shall be required for maintenance purposes. The term of any surety shall extend for the period from the issuance of the permit until the project is completed, and additionally beyond that for the duration of the warranty and maintenance period.
(5)
Partial release. Once a project has been inspected and completed, the county may, at the discretion of the community development department, release a portion of the surety amount; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once the applicable maintenance period has passed, the remaining surety amount shall be released.
(6)
Prerequisite; calling surety. No permit or approval for work in the right-of-way shall be issued by the community development department until the surety has been furnished to the county, in a form acceptable to the county. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable Bartow County Ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work.
(7)
Waiver. The community development department shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the county.
(i)
Warranty. Any permit holder working in the right-of-way shall provide a two-year warranty for any work conducted under authority of this article. The two-year warranty shall commence upon the completion of the work. The surety shall remain in effect during the warranty period. During the warranty period, the permit holder shall be responsible to repair any defects in the work or repair, or correct any deficiencies that are not up to the standards and regulations of the county ordinances.
