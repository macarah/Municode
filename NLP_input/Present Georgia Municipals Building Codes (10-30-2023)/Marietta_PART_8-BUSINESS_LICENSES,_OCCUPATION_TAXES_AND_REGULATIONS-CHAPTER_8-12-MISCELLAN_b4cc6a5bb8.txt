The safety inspection is a component of every baseline inspection.
"Rental property" means all dwellings, dwelling units, and rooming units located within the city and rented or leased for any valuable consideration, but excludes dwellings owned by the federal government, the state or any of their agencies or political subdivisions and facilities licensed by the state as health care facilities.

C.
Hearings and Determinations.
1.
The hearing shall be conducted by the business license manager, an agent or by one or more hearing officers who have not personally determined the factual issues in controversy at the hearing and have no personal financial interest in the outcome of the hearing. In its discretion the business license manager may, but need not, appoint an employee of the city or other person possessing qualifications acceptable to the business license manager as a hearing officer to hear and receive evidence and render a decision on the law and the facts. The hearing officer has all the authority possessed by the business license manager to render decisions. While presiding at a hearing, the business license manager or hearing officer shall determine whether the proposed action comports with the requirements and standards in the applicable provisions of city charter, ordinance, or code or state or federal constitution or law.
2.
The business license manager or hearing officer has authority to administer oaths and affirmations; sign and issue subpoenas; rule upon offers of proof; compel testimony; receive evidence; dispose of motions relating to the discovery and production of relevant documents and things for inspection, copying, or photographing; regulate the course of the hearing; set the time and place for continued hearings; fix the time for filing of briefs and other documents; direct the parties to appear and confer to consider simplification of issues, admissions of facts or documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and limitation of the number of witnesses; issue appropriate orders that control the subsequent course of the proceeding; dispose of motions; and control the decorum and conduct of the proceeding.
3.
All testimony shall be taken under oath or by affirmation.
4.
No person shall fail to comply with the orders of the business license manager or hearing officer at the hearing. Violation of this requirement may be prosecuted in municipal court in the same manner that other municipal offenses are prosecuted.
5.
The proceedings of the hearing shall be recorded through tape recording, stenographic, or other verbatim reproduction, and copies of transcriptions of the proceedings shall be available, upon payment of the reasonable costs thereof, to the parties to the hearing.
6.
Unless otherwise provided by city charter, ordinance, or code or by state or federal constitution or law, the proponent of an order has the burden of proof, and every party to the proceeding has the right to present such party's case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The business license manager or hearing officer may receive all or part of the evidence in written form if the interests of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially and if the hearing will be expedited thereby. The rules of evidence and requirements of proof and procedure shall conform to the extent practicable to those in civil nonjury cases, but when necessary to ascertain facts affecting the substantial rights of the parties to the proceeding, the business license manager or hearing officer may receive and consider evidence not admissible under such rules if such evidence possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. The person conducting the hearing shall give effect to the rules of privilege required by law, may exclude incompetent and unduly repetitious evidence, and may receive documentary evidence in the form of a copy or excerpt if the copy is authenticated. The business license manager or hearing officer shall use its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in evaluating the evidence presented to it. Parties to the hearing may make objections to evidentiary offers, which shall then be noted in the record. In the absence of objection, the hearings may be conducted informally, and failure to request any procedure shall constitute a waiver thereof.
7.
The business license manager or hearing officer may issue a decision at the hearing and shall issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law, setting forth the grounds of the decision, based on the evidence presented at the hearing. The business license manager shall serve the decision on each party to the hearing by personal service or by mailing by regular mail, to the last address furnished to the business license manager by the party. The decision shall be effective as to such party on the date mailed or on such other date as is stated in the decision.
8.
Unless otherwise provided by city charter, ordinance, or code or by state or federal constitution or law, the decision of the business license manager or hearing officer is final subject only to judicial review pursuant to writ of certiorari. No defense or objection may be presented for judicial review unless it is first presented to the business license manager or hearing officer, prior to the decision thereof.
