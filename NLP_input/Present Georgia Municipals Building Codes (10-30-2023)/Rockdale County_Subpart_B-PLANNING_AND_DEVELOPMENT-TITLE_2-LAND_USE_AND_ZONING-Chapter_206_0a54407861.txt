Chapter 206 - BASE ZONING DISTRICTS

Sec. 206-1. - W-P watershed protection district.
(a)
Legislative findings; purpose and intent.
(1)
The board of commissioners finds that Big Haynes Creek was identified as a feasible water source for Rockdale County in a regional water supply plan adopted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) in 1976. The ARC plan was preceded by a number of other studies that supported an impoundment on Big Haynes Creek. Consistent with these plans and studies, and the county's comprehensive plan, the county first enacted the W-P zoning district regulations and determined that the W-P zoning regulations were needed in the drainage basin contributing to the Upper Big Haynes Creek in 1981 to protect the watershed. These watershed protection zoning regulations require an average lot size of three acres (minimum two acres), among other restrictions, to protect the environmental and aesthetic qualities of this district and to protect the watershed from future environmental degradation.
The board of commissioners further find that in 1987, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division studied the reservoir and the Conyers-Rockdale Big Haynes Creek Impoundment Authority was created by the Georgia General Assembly and charged with constructing a surface water impoundment for a water supply for Rockdale County. In 1988, the Atlanta Regional Commission adopted a regional water supply plan that identified the Big Haynes project. The ARC has repeatedly warned that the region will not be able to meet its water supply demands unless local and regional water supplies are developed. In addition, one of the critical issues identified by the Governor's Growth Strategies Commission was the importance of expanding Georgia's water supply base. The Big Haynes Authority consulted with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, the U.S. Wildlife Federation, the Georgia Conservancy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Federation and numerous other agencies. The authority held numerous public hearings on the project before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued the Federal Clean Water Act Section 404 permit in October 1992. To protect this future water supply, the Rockdale Board of Commissioners rezoned the remaining portion of the reservoir's watershed in 1993, applying the following regulations to said properties consistent with this extensive planning for this project. The county finds that these W-P regulations, in addition to implementing these studies, will also assist in implementing a two-year study, facilitated by ARC, of the 82-square mile watershed which resulted in a five-county agreement to control pollution in stormwater that runs off impervious surfaces, such as roads, parking lots and rooftops, within the watershed.
The board of commissioners further finds that the W-P zoning regulations are necessary to protect water quality for the county's water treatment plant, capable of treating 22.1 million gallons of water per day (MGD), completed in 2002, enabling Rockdale to utilize Randy Poynter Lake for potable water consistent with these W-P regulations.
(2)
The board of commissioners further finds that the county benefits from additional public parks and recreational facilities and programs. Consistent with this finding the board of commissioners finds that the Randy Poynter Lake (formerly Big Haynes reservoir) property may be used for limited recreation purposes in addition to water supply purposes consistent with the following regulations and those found in chapter 62, article II and the county's comprehensive plan, as amended.
(3)
The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interests of the citizens of the county to establish and protect a reservoir for drinking water and limited recreational purposes in this part of the county. The board of commissioners finds the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan adopted July 9, 1991, made certain findings and recommendations regarding water quality, wetlands establishment and preservation, provision of water supply, establishment and preservation and protection of a watershed district, and expansion of public and private recreation uses in the Big Haynes basin. Said comprehensive plan has since been amended and updated. The board of commissioners incorporates the analyses and findings set out in the Rockdale County Comprehensive Plan, as amended, regarding those matters and finds that action to accomplish the goals and objectives as set out in the comprehensive plan are implemented in the following W-P regulations. The board of commissioners finds that the Rockdale Comprehensive Plan requires protection of the Big Haynes Watershed in order to provide optimum conditions for the impoundment of the reservoir and the public water intake site. The board of commissioners further finds that the Rockdale Comprehensive Plan, as amended, determines that the impoundment of the reservoir and the establishment of the watershed protection zoning district are necessary actions to protect the integrity of the reservoir and intake site, particularly those zoning regulations establishing an average lot size of three acres (minimum lot size of two acres), prohibiting commercial and other non-residential uses, and establishing buffers. The board of commissioners finds that the following regulations governing the W-P district are consistent with the comprehensive plan and will serve to substantially implement the plan.
(4)
The board of commissioners further finds that the watershed protection district as recommended in the comprehensive plan, as amended, will allow for protection of wetlands and the preservation of the integrity of water supplies to the greatest extent possible. The state Department of Natural Resources "Environmental Planning Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds" defines Big Haynes Creek as a "small" water supply watershed. The state Department of Natural Resources' criteria require, among other things, streamside and lakeside vegetated buffers, impervious surface setbacks, and septic tank and drain field setbacks, and that impervious surface be limited throughout the entire watershed to a maximum of 25 percent of the area. As a result of the Atlanta Regional Commission cooperative watershed study, and other studies, the necessary limitation for impervious surface throughout the entire W-P district is at least ten percent of the total area.
(5)
The following regulations are intended to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the county and to implement the policies and objectives and findings of the comprehensive plan, as amended, through the enactment of regulations governing the use of the affected land pursuant to the county's zoning, planning and general police powers. The purpose of the watershed protection zoning district is to protect the public health by setting standards for land use which will maintain, and where possible improve the purity of water in the streams in the county that flow into the public water intake and reservoir. The W-P district is intended to provide for low density residential development, public and private open space, park land, and related uses that are compatible with the primary purpose of protecting the purity of the water and that are substantially related to the primary intended land use of low-density residential development and limited recreational uses.

The regulations set forth in this section shall apply to all land within this W-P district.
(d)
Watershed subzones delineated. The watershed protection (W-P) district has distinct land areas that require separate regulations. Accordingly, there are hereby created within the W-P district the following five subzones:
(1)
Watershed/non-reservoir area (W-NR).
(2)
Watershed/reservoir water area (W-RW).
(3)
Watershed/reservoir recreation area (W-RR).
(4)
Watershed/reservoir buffer area (W-RB).
(5)
Watershed/reservoir prohibited area (W-RP).
These five subzones shall be delineated as specified on the official zoning map and made a part of this section. Uses permitted within each subzone shall be as specified in the table of permitted uses. All other regulations set forth in this section shall apply to all subzones unless otherwise stated. The following further describes each subzone area:
(1)
W-NR: Watershed/non-reservoir area. The watershed/non-reservoir area subzone comprises the watershed area within the boundaries of the county as defined in the comprehensive plan. This area comprises all land outside the reservoir water area, the reservoir buffer area, the reservoir recreation area and the reservoir prohibited areas.
(2)
W-RW: Watershed/reservoir water area. The watershed/reservoir water area subzone comprises the entire area of the water impoundment owned in fee simple by the county.
(3)
W-RR: Watershed/reservoir recreation area. The watershed/reservoir recreation area subzone comprises the areas suitable for recreational uses. This subzone comprises governmentally owned land both within and outside the normal pool of the reservoir. The portion of the recreation area subzone lying outside the normal pool area comprises approximately 25 percent of the reservoir shoreline and is subject to the Big Haynes Reservoir Management Ordinance as found in article II of chapter 62.
(4)
W-RB: Watershed/reservoir buffer area. The watershed/reservoir buffer area subzone is comprised of the land area lying within 150 feet, horizontally, outside of the reservoir impoundment water surface at normal pool.
(5)

This subzone comprises approximately one percent of the reservoir shoreline.
(e)
Permitted uses. The table of permitted uses sets forth the uses permitted in each subzone of the watershed protection zoning district. Any use not expressly permitted in such table is prohibited. Uses or accessory uses which generate or utilize hazardous or toxic waste are prohibited.
(f)
Nonconforming uses. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), all nonconforming situations shall be regulated pursuant to chapter 234 of the UDO.
(g)
Nonconforming retail uses.
(1)
Findings. The board of commissioners finds that four nonconforming community store uses were in existence in the W-P district prior to the enactment of the watershed protection zoning district. The board of commissioners finds that the necessity for stringent environmental and water quality regulations in the district must be carefully balanced with the individual hardships associated with restrictions on these nonconforming uses as well as the public interest served by continuing to provide existing general store/retail services to residents and visitors in the district. Accordingly, the board of commissioners finds that with regard to these existing nonconforming W-P country store uses, limited expansion may be authorized, but only in strict accordance with the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (g)(2). It is the specific intent of this subsection (g) to prohibit any new non-residential use or structure not specifically authorized herein, including but not limited to restaurants, convenience stores, gasoline sales, and other retail establishments.
