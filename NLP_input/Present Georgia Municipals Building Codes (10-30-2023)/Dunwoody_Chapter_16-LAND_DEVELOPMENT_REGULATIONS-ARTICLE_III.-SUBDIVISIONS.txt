The original recorded plat must be used for all revisions.

c.
Minor. Changes to an approved or recorded subdivision plat, including but not limited to, adjusting lots and lot lines, utility easements, streets, shifting of open space and common areas, and other changes considered by the director of community development to be minor in nature and that do not create any additional lots may be approved administratively by staff as a final plat, so long as open space and amenities are not reduced or made less effective, and the overall result is not a substantially new design. The submission of official plats for signing, recording, and for the department record shall be followed as required in this chapter.
