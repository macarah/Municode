Conditions of airport use; liability: All users of and persons on the airport shall be governed by these regulations and by any emergency directives issued by the airport management pursuant to section 2-3-2. These regulations supersede all those previously published and are subject to change by the county airport commission. These regulations are not intended to amend, modify or supersede any provisions of the federal, state, and county or any specific contractual agreement of the county or city with which they may conflict and shall insofar as possible, be interpreted so that no such conflict shall exist. If any of these regulations become invalid or unenforceable due to a revision, then all other regulations shall nevertheless remain in effect.
The owner, (county commission), obligates itself to operate the airport for the use and benefit of the public and to keep the airport open to the various types, kinds and classes of aeronautical use for which the airport facility is designed and intended to serve. The owner has established these rules to be met by all users so as to provide for the safe and efficient use of the airport and to otherwise protect the safety of persons and property both on the ground and in the air.
It is understood that the landing area facilities constructed are primarily intended for the use of powered aircraft, the weights of which are not in excess of the published strengths of the paved surfaces concerned. Operations on these surfaces, of aircraft slightly in excess of the published pavement strengths, may be permitted on an infrequent basis with the permission of the airport manager.
Considering the owner's obligation to keep the airport open to the public for aeronautical purposes, the airport facilities will not be used for nonaviation events which would conflict with its aeronautical use unless it is approved by the airport manager.
The use of the airport or any of its facilities in any manner shall create an obligation on the part of the user to obey all regulations herein provided and otherwise adopted by the owner. The right of using the airport and its facilities shall be conditioned on the assumption of full responsibility and risk by the user, and the user shall release and hold harmless and indemnify the owner, its officers and employees, from any liability of loss resulting from such use, as well as claims of third persons to using the airport.
The air traffic rules and aircraft operations regulations of the FAA, as in effect and all additions thereto, are made a part of these regulations as fully as if set forth herein.
(b)
Amendments to rules and regulations: Future amendments, additions deletions or corrections to these rules and regulations may be promulgated by the county board of commissioners and shall be filed with the county commission and the county clerk.
(c)
Special regulations, notices or directives: Special regulations, notices, memorandums or directives of an operational nature of interest to persons engaged in business with the airport shall be issued under the authority of these regulations.
(d)
Emergency powers of the airport management: When an emergency exists at the airport the airport management is empowered to issue such direction and take such action which, within his discretion and judgment, is necessary or desirable to protect persons or property and expedite the operation of the airport. Such directives and actions of the airport manager shall have the force of a regulation hereunder so long as said emergency exists.
(e)
Posting of rules and regulations: The airport manager and all fixed base operators at the airport shall post a copy of these rules and regulations in a conspicuous location for the use of employees and customers.
(f)
Nonliability of the county and the county airport commission: The use of the airport and its facilities shall be at all times conditioned upon the assumption of full responsibility therefor by every person exercising or taking advantage of the use of. It shall be a further condition thereof that each person, as a consideration for the use of the airport and for its facilities, shall at all times release, hold harmless and indemnify the county and its agents and employees from any and all responsibility, liability, loss or damage, resulting to any such person, or responsibility, liability, loss or damage, resulting to any such person, or caused by or on his or her behalf, and incident to the manner in which the airport is operated, constructed or maintained, or served from within or without, or used from without. The use of the airport by any person for any purpose, or the paying of fees therefor, or the taking off or landing aircraft thereon, shall be itself an acknowledgment that such person accepts such privileges on the condition herein set forth.

(i)
Categories of aircraft: Final determination as to the proper category designation of any aircraft shall rest with the county airport commission, in accordance with the following:
(1)
Private:
a.
Privately owned aircraft will be operated noncommercially by owner or owners. The aircraft can be used in connection with the owner's business in a manner comparable to the owner's use of his private automobile. Company and corporation owned aircraft that are operated for the transportation of their and other personnel and/or products are classified as private aircraft.
b.
Flying clubs. A flying club is recognized as a plan for the joint ownership of aircraft and the fair distribution of the cost of maintaining and operating those aircraft. Such operation is not considered to be commercial in nature when so operated; neither is flight instruction by club members for other club members to be commercial in nature so long as there is no profit or for-hire motive involved in the operation. Club aircraft must be owned and operated by a non-profit partnership or non-profit Georgia corporation, and each club member must be a bona fide owner of a part of the aircraft or a share in the corporation. The club may not derive greater revenue from the use of its aircraft than the amount necessary for the operation, maintenance and replacement of its aircraft and will file and keep up to date with the airport manager a list of membership. At any time the airport manager has reason to believe that a club aircraft is being so operated that it falls under the "commercial" classification hereunder, he shall so notify the club and if they fail to remedy conditions complained of, the airport manager shall reclassify the aircraft and levy fees necessary to the pertinent type of operation.
c.
Aircraft of sale. New or old aircraft held for sale may be demonstrated to prospective purchasers, or, when sold, may be used to instruct the new owner of their operation.
(2)
Commercial: Aircraft used:
a.
To carry passengers for hire.
b.
For rental, hire or charter.
c.
Flight instruction and its kindred occupations.
d.
Any aircraft used for commercial purpose including aerial application and not otherwise covered in these regulations.
(j)
Balloons and model aircraft: No person shall operate or release any model aircraft, rocket, kite, balloon or similar contrivance at or upon the airport except hot air balloons as defined by FAR 1-1.
(k)
Parachute jumping: The FAA has defined "parachute jumping" as an aeronautical use. Consequently, requests of clubs, organizations and individuals to establish a drop zone within the boundaries or reservation for the airport shall be evaluated by the airport manager on the same basis as other aeronautical uses of the airport. The airport manager shall not be required to permit or allow any request to establish a drop zone for parachute jumping within the boundaries of the airport. However, the airport manager shall exercise his judgment or discretion in determining whether to permit, allow or disallow such request based on information contained in the application to establish a drop zone or carry on parachute jumping activities within the boundaries of the airport and considering safety to applicants and the public making other use of the airport and the FARs and advisory circulars or other FAA guidance at the time and date of request and at the time of the proposed activity. The airport manager shall require written application from any person, club or organization requesting a permit to establish a drop zone or to carry on parachute jumping activities within the boundaries of the airport. The form shall be as prescribed by the airport manager but shall minimally contain the following information:
(1)
The address of the individual who will be directing and in charge of the parachute jumping activity who is hereinafter referred to as the "drop zone operator";
(2)

(Ord. No. 1999-005A, 12-28-99)
Sec. 2-3-6. - Marking and lighting unserviceable areas including closed runways and taxiways.
(a)
Generally: Application of the standards and practices contained in the appropriate FAA Advisory Circular, "Marking of Paved Areas on Airports," apply when there is a closed or hazardous area on the airport or when a deceptive area exists and the airport manager determines that an operational need exists to mark same. Replace or modify as soon as possible existing markings that are not in accordance with those described in the advisory circular.
(b)
Hazardous and unserviceable parts of the air operations area:
(1)
Where a relatively small paved area has failed or for any other reason becomes hazardous for aircraft operation and it is not intended to close the entire area to operations, use red flags not less than 18 inches square for day marking and use red lights for night marking to delineate the hazardous area. When flags are made of fabric, use a wire stiffener to hold the flag in an extended position. Mount flags so they are not a hazard.
(2)
Where large apron areas are unserviceable, place a cross, as shown by the appropriate FAA advisory circular, in the center of the unserviceable area. If this type movement area is used at night, place red lights to delineate the unserviceable parts of the area.
(3)
On runways or taxiways where the unserviceable area is such as to render the runway or taxiway or portion thereof unusable, place red lights at the entrance to such areas and disconnect controls to the runway or taxiway lights in the section rendered unusable.
(4)
Use red lights of at least ten (10) candlepower for night marking of unserviceable parts of the movement areas. Red lights with a light distribution equivalent to a fixture meeting the requirements in AC 150/5345-2, Specification for L-180 Obstruction Light, are acceptable.
(c)
Closed airports: When the entire air operations area is rendered unsafe by a hazardous condition, declare the field closed and mark as follows:
(1)
Day marking: Place a cross at a central location readily visible from the air. Make all crosses in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular 150/5340-1D, "Marking of Paved Areas on Airports."
(2)
Night marking: Disconnect controls to runway, boundary, and landing direction indicator lights. Permit the beacon to remain in operation unless the airport is to be closed permanently, in which case the appropriate FAA regional director should be notified before extinguishing the beacon.
(d)
Color: Use aviation yellow for all deceptive, closed, and hazardous area markings.
(e)
Notification: Immediately report closed runways and taxiways, airport hazardous areas and closed airports to the Atlanta Flight Service Station (404-691-1474).
(f)
Safety during construction: These guidelines apply to all construction work which may affect the movement of aircraft:
(1)
Prior to the development of contract specifications for construction activity affecting aircraft movement areas, safety requirements relating thereto should be coordinated between the airport management and appropriate representatives of the FAA to determine the restrictions required for the project's special provisions, which should result in a minimum of interference to aircraft operations.
(2)
For construction activity to be performed in other than active operational areas, the storage and parking of equipment and materials when not in use or about to be installed should not encroach upon active operational areas. In protecting operational areas, the minimum clearances maintained for runways will be in agreement with FAR Part 77. For taxiways, maintained clearances will not be less than fifty (50) feet from the pavement edge.
(3)
Open-flame, welding, or torch cutting operations are to be prohibited unless adequate fire and safety precautions have been made and approved by the airport management.
(4)
Open trenches, excavations, and stockpiled material at the construction-site will be prominently marked with red flags and lighted by red light units (acceptable to the airport manager) during hours of restricted visibility and/or darkness.
(5)
All vehicles will be clearly identified for control purposes, by assigned numbers prominently displayed on each side. The identifying symbols should be eight-inch minimum, block-type characters of a color easily read on a contrasting background. They may be applied by use of tape or water soluble paint to facilitate removal.
(6)
All vehicles will follow routes and roadways selected by the airport manager or his representative and stay clear of areas adjacent to NAVAIDS that if traversed could cause emission of false signals or failure of NAVAIDS. These sensitive areas will be identified and clearly marked by the airport engineer.
(7)
The county engineer will identify and mark with yellow flags the location of all utilities in the construction areas that if interrupted, could cause failure of a facility or NAVAID.
(8)
The airport manager will issue the necessary notices to airmen, (NOTAMs), to reflect hazardous conditions. NOTAMs will be kept current and reflect the actual condition with respect to construction situations, active NOTAMs will be reviewed periodically.
(9)
Frequent inspections will be made by the airport manager during critical phases of the work to insure that the contractor is following the recommended safety procedures.

Sec. 2-3-7. - Bird hazard reduction and sanitary landfills.
(a)
Birds are not a current hazard; however, trees located around the Richard B. Russell Airport are potential bird nesting sites. Periodic checks of the trees in the immediate area will be conducted by the airport manager or his representative to assure that these areas have not become nesting areas.
(b)
In the event the trees become nesting sites, proven effective measures will be taken to eliminate the possible hazard this condition would create to operating aircraft. Such measures may include arming personnel with shotguns with authority to kill or drive away the birds, the use of bio-acoustics, habitat manipulation, removal of attractants, bird distress calls, chemical repellents and/or the use of pyrotechnics.
(c)
Visual surveillance for birds will be maintained by the operations personnel. All operating aircraft will be notified on the common traffic advisory frequency, of any flocks of birds detected.

Sec. 2-3-61. - Zones.
In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the instrument approach zones, noninstrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone. The areas and zones are shown on the Russell Field Airport Zoning Map consisting of one (1) sheet prepared by Williams and Sweitzer Engineers, dated August 21, 1961, which is attached to the resolution from which this article is derived and which is made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(1)
Instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of the instrument runway for instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach zones shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(2)
Noninstrument approach zone. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all noninstrument runways on the airport for noninstrument landings and takeoffs. The noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of four hundred (400) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand four hundred (2,400) feet at a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(3)
Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established adjacent to each instrument and noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones, symmetrically located on either side of the runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line two hundred (200) feet on either side of the centerline of the noninstrument runway, for the length of such runway, plus two hundred (200) feet on each end; and five hundred (500) feet on either side of the centerline of the instrument runway, for the length of such runway, plus two hundred (200) feet on each end, and are parallel and level with such runway centerlines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one (1) foot vertically for each seven (7) feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to both instrument and non-instrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. The transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of the zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one (1) foot vertically for each seven (7) feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. Additionally, transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument approach zone where it projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(4)
Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of seven thousand (7,000) feet. The horizontal zone does not include the instrument and noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones.
(5)
Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established commencing at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extending to a distance of twelve thousand (12,000) feet from the airport reference point. The conical zone does not include the instrument and non-instrument approach zones and transition zones.
(Code 1979, § 6-3043)
Sec. 2-3-62. - Height limitations.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the height limits herein established for that zone. The height limitations are computed from the established airport elevation and are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
(1)
Instrument approach zones. One (1) foot in height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway; thence one (1) foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway.
(2)
Noninstrument approach zones. One (1) foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from the end of the non-instrument runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway.
(3)
Transition zones. One (1) foot in height for each seven (7) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from the centerline of noninstrument runways and five hundred (500) feet from the centerline of the instrument runway, measured at right angles to the longitudinal centerline of the runway, extending upward to a maximum height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation which is six hundred forty-four (644) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one (1) foot vertical height for each seven (7) feet of horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of one (1) foot for each seven (7) feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained, beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zone and extending a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the edge of the instrument approach zone measured at right angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(4)
Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation or a maximum height of seven hundred ninety-four (794) feet above mean sea level elevation.
(5)
Conical zone. One (1) foot in height for each twenty (20) feet of horizontal distance, beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and measured in an inclined plane passing through the airport reference point.
(b)
Where an area is covered by more than one (1) height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
(c)
Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to forty-five (45) feet above the surface of the land.
(Code 1979, § 6-3044)

(a)
Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the resolution from which this article was derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of such resolution and was diligently prosecuted.
(b)
Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the county superintendent of public works or any other duly appointed official to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the county.
(Code 1979, § 6-3046)
Sec. 2-3-65. - Permits.
(a)
Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (1), (2) and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby created, unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted:
(1)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except where because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zones.
(2)
In the areas lying within the limits of the instrument and noninstrument approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except where such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for the instrument or noninstrument approach zone.
(3)
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except where such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic feature would extend above the height limit prescribed for the transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 2-3-62.
(b)
Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the resolution from which this article was derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(c)
Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the building inspection department or other duly authorized official determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
(d)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use such person's property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of zoning appeals for a variance from such regulations. The variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article.
(e)
Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the county, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon, such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
