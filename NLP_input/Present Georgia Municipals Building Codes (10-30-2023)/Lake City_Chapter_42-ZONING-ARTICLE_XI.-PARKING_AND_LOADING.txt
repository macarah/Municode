ARTICLE XI. - PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 42-323. - Off-street parking and loading spaces required.
(a)
It is the intent of this chapter that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes.
(b)
Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure in excess of 200 square feet shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein.
(c)
Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be required. Existing uses providing off-street parking shall have 12 months from date of adoption of the resolution from which this chapter is derived to comply with handicapped parking requirements. New uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate handicapped spaces into the design of parking facilities.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-324. - Design standards.
(a)
Off-street parking spaces and driveways. The following are the design requirements for off-street parking spaces and driveways:
(1)
Required dimensions for each parking space. Each full-size automobile parking space shall be not less than nine feet wide and 20 feet deep. Adequate interior driveways shall connect each parking space with a public right-of-way.
(2)
Interior driveways. Where 90-degree parking is utilized, all interior driveways shall be a minimum of 24 feet in width. If 60-degree angle parking is used then interior driveways shall be at least 12 feet in width for one-way traffic and 24 feet in width for two-way traffic. In the instance where parallel parking is utilized or there is no parking, interior driveways shall be a minimum of ten feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic.
(3)
Surfacing, drainage and lighting. All off-street parking spaces, access and interior driveways shall be provided with a paved, dust free surface. If the off-street parking facilities are used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security. The lighting shall be designed so as not to reflect onto or cause glare in any adjacent residential district. For single-family residences, off-street parking areas shall be paved at minimum for the entire width of the right-of-way.
(4)
Sharing of required off-street parking spaces. One-half of the off-street parking spaces required by a use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be shared with a use that will be closed at night or on Sundays. The combined parking requirements for two or more uses participating in a cooperative parking arrangement may be partially reduced by the city manager or their representative, provided that the uses will not conflict in time of operation or need for the parking spaces and provided that the parking needs of each use at a given time of day may be adequately met through the parking arrangements.
(5)
Handicapped spaces. Parallel spaces for the handicapped adjacent to a walk shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width by 24 feet in length. If a walk is at an elevation different from the elevation of the parking space, a 1:6 ramp shall be provided up to the walk. For 90-degree or angled spaces the minimum width of a stall shall be nine feet. An aisle, having a width of not less than three feet six inches, shall be identified by pavement markings and by appropriate signage.
(b)
Off-street loading stalls. The following are the design requirements for off-street loading stalls:
(1)
Required dimensions for each loading stall. Each loading stall shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 18 feet in length, except that for wholesale and industrial use, loading stalls shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 50 feet in length.
(2)
Access. All off-street loading stalls shall have access from an alley, or if there is no alley, from a public street.
(3)
Surfacing, drainage and lighting. All off-street loading stalls and access shall be provided with a paved, dust-free surface.
If loading stalls are to be used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles and for security. Lighting shall be designed to preclude light spill onto adjacent properties.

The following are the minimum number of off-street parking spaces and loading stalls required by type of permitted uses. For any use not listed, the mayor and council shall determine the proper requirements by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein as to assure equal treatment.
