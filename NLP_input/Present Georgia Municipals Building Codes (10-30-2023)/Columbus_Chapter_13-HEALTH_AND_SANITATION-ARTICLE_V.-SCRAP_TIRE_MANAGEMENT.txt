Sec. 13-132. - Definitions.
For the purpose of this article;
EPD means Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division.
End user means the last person who uses the scrap tires, chips, crumb rubber, or similar materials to make a product with economic value or, in the case of energy recovery, the person who utilizes the heat content or other forms of energy from the incineration of pyrolysis of waste tires, chips or similar materials.
Manifest means a form or document used for identifying the quantity and composition and the origin, routing, and destination, through any intermediate points, to an end user, processor, or disposer approved by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD).
Mixed tires means a heterogeneous group of tires consisting of "used", "retreadable casings", and "scrap tires".
Retreadable casing means a tire which has the quality and soundness of the tire structure to accept a retread or repair and provide additional service and is destined for retreading.
Retail tire dealer means a person actively engaged in the business of selling new replacement tires. Retail tire dealers may also be, but are not limited to, manufacturers, wholesalers, and others who sell new replacement tires to the ultimate consumer.
Scrap tire means a tire that is no longer suitable for its original intended purpose because of wear, damage, or defect.
Scrap tire carrier means any person engaged in picking up or transporting scrap tires not otherwise exempted in this Section for the purpose of removal to a scrap tire processor, end user, or disposal facility.
Scrap tire generator means any person who generates scrap tires. Generators may include, but are not limited to, retail tire dealers, retreaders, scrap tire processors, automobile dealers, private company vehicle maintenance shops, garages, service stations, and city, county, and state governments.
Scrap tire processing means any method, system, or other treatment designed to change the physical form, size, or chemical content of scrap tires and includes all aspects of its management (administration, personnel, land, equipment, buildings, and other elements). Processing includes, but is not limited to, shredding, baling, recycling, or sorting of scrap tires.
Scrap tire processor means any person who is approved by the EPD to receive scrap tires from generators or scrap tire carriers for the purpose of scrap tire processing.
Scrap tire sorter means any person, other than the original scrap tire generator, who handles mixed tires by separating used tires and retreadable casings from scrap tires.
Tire retreader means any person actively engaged in the business of retreading scrap tires by scarifying the surface to remove the old surface tread and attaching a new tread to make a usable tire.
Ultimate consumer means the last person who receives and uses a new replacement tire. Ultimate consumers may be, but are not limited to:
(1)
An individual consumer;
(2)
A leasing company purchasing tires from retailers for their vehicle fleet;

Used tire means a tire which has a minimum of 2/32" of road tread and which is still suitable for its original purpose. It must be inventoried and marketed in substantially the same fashion as a new tire, the dealer must be able to provide satisfactory evidence to the EPD and the special enforcement division that a market exists, and that the used tires are, in fact, being marketed.
(Ord. No. 95-10, 2-7-95)
Sec. 13-133. - Scrap tire generators.
(a)
Any person who generates scrap tires shall have a Scrap Tire Generator Identification Number (ID#) issued by the EPD. The ID# shall be used on scrap tire shipment manifests. Separate ID numbers shall be required for generators having multiple generation locations.
(b)
Generators shall initiate a 3-part manifest to transport scrap tires from the point of generation to an end user or to a scrap tire processing or disposal facility approved by the EPD. The manifest shall include the following information:
(1)
Name and ID# of the generator;
(2)
Number of total tons (accurate to within ten percent of actual number) of scrap tires to be transported;
(3)
Name and permit number of the scrap tire carrier;
(4)
Date of transport; and
(5)
Destination of scrap tires.
(c)
If a generator chooses to use tons of tires rather than actual numbers of tires on the manifest for passenger and truck tires, the following conversion factor must be used:
Passenger Tires: 2000 lb. (one ton) = 100 tires, @ 20 lb/tire;
Truck Tires: 2000 lb. (one ton) = 20 tires, @ 100 lb/tire.
(d)
Unless otherwise approved in writing by the EPD, generators shall assure that any person collecting and transporting their scrap tires hold a valid Scrap Tire Carrier Permit issued by the EPD; provided, however, that a person who generates less than 100 tires per month and who transports only their own scrap tires to approved end users, processors, recyclers, or disposers are not required to have a Scrap Tire Carrier Permit, but must comply with all other provisions required of generators and scrap tire carriers.
(e)
Generators shall maintain receipts (copies of the completed manifest) for a period of three years.
(f)
A generator shall report to the special enforcement division any carrier who fails to return a properly completed manifest to the generator within 30 days of scrap tires pickup as provided for in section 13-134 (d) of this article. Such report shall be filed within 30 days of failure of the carrier to comply.
(g)
Generators may choose to determine whether a tire because of wear, damage, or defect, is not suitable for classification as a "used tire", or "retreadable casing" as defined in this article. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used", "retreadable casings", or "scrap tires", then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thusly indicated on the shipment manifest.
(Ord. No. 95-10, 2-7-95)
