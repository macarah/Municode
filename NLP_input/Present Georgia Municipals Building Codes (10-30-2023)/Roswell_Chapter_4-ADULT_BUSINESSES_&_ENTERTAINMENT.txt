Chapter 4 - ADULT BUSINESSES & ENTERTAINMENT
Article 4.1 - Adult Businessesâ€”General

Section 4.1.1 - Purpose and Findings.
The mayor and council of the City of Roswell based on the experiences of other communities and municipalities, on studies, reports and findings of other communities, specifically Indianapolis, Indiana; Austin, Texas; St. Paul, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Manatee County, Florida; Smyrna, Georgia; and Richmond County, Georgia which are experiences and findings relevant to the problems faced by the City of Roswell find and declare that adult businesses, by their nature, generate secondary effects unless regulated. These effects as testified to by Major Jim Mullins (retired) a thirty-year veteran with the City of Atlanta Police Department, Major Ken Burnette (retired) a twenty-eight-year veteran from the City of Atlanta Police Department, V. R. Stuebing, land use, planning and zoning expert, and Captain Joan Krol of the Roswell Police Department include blight, downgrading of neighborhoods, lowering of property values, and a tendency to attract undesirable persons who may engage in certain types of criminal conduct. Among the acts identified with such establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Experience in other cities has shown that where adult businesses are concentrated, neighborhoods deteriorate and the areas become less desirable places in which to work and live. Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.
The following sections are intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impact caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult bookstores, adult businesses and erotic dance establishments. The mayor and council find that restricting adult businesses to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate adult businesses by establishing zones where adult businesses are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, and by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult business uses and other uses so as to afford the most protection to residential uses.
This chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and adult businesses versus the protected rights of such businesses and their patrons. It is not the intent of the mayor and council, in enacting this ordinance, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor is it the intent to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books, or other materials. Further, the mayor and council do not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor do they intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit such constitutionally protected materials.

Article 4.3 - Adult Bookstores and Video Stores

Section 4.3.1 - Purpose and Findings.
Based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Fulton County, Georgia which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Roswell, Georgia, and based on documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by law enforcement personnel during the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, the mayor and council of the City of Roswell take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at adult bookstores and video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing materials, films, videos, or other reproductions depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the mayor and council further note that persons frequent such adult bookstores and video viewing booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths.
The mayor and council find that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in adult bookstores and video stores be removed and that no holes be allowed to exist between adjoining booths. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in adult bookstores and video stores. The mayor and council further find that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this ordinance is hereby adopted.

Article 4.4. - Massage Establishments and Spas[1]
modified

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's noteâ€” Ord. No. 2022-05-02, Exh. A, adopted May 9, 2022, repealed the former Art. 4.4., Â§Â§ 4.4.1â€”4.4.11, and enacted a new Art. 4.4 as set out herein. The former Art. 4.4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2004-05-13, Amended, 5/10/2004.

Section 4.4.1 - Purpose and Legislative Findings.
modified
The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the practice of massage therapy is an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public and that the practice of massage therapy by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. Â§Â§ 43-24A-1, et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The city council agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the city council based on research including but limited to "Examining the Association Between Massage Parlors and Neighborhood Crime," "Georgia Illicit Massage Industry," and "Estimating Demand for Illicit Massage Businesses in Houston, Texas," finds that, for many massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage establishments, but one rational distinction is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to safeguard against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises. It is a purpose of this article to impose licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, and related sex crimes, yet without hindering legitimate massage establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage establishments and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the city's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
