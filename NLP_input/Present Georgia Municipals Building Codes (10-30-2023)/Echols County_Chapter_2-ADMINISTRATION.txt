Where practicable, all county purchases and contract work shall be subject to fair and open bidding subject to state law, county ordinance and the following:
(1)
State contract prices. Items that can be purchased from a published list of bid prices provided by the state or its agencies may be purchased in accordance with such bid list and contract price without bids subject to the accrual of revenue and availability of funds which shall be confirmed and coordinated with the board of commissioners prior to purchase.
(2)
Small purchases. Small purchases of less than $250.00 may be from suppliers and distributors in the ordinary course of business when such purchases are generally sold on a competitive basis. When several small purchases can be reasonably combined for nonmonthly recurring purchases, then consideration shall be given to a pooled or bulk purchase subject to the bidding process.
(3)
Purchases between $250.00 and $2,500.00. For items sold by more than one distributor, at least two sources shall be contacted and a cost estimate obtained from each of the items costing up to $2,500.00.

Documentation shall include information as to the cost of such equipment if new, its availability, warranty, expected life, proposed use, etc.
(6)
Bulk purchases.

In cases in which a bid by a local vendor is within five percent of the lowest overall bid supplied by a nonlocal vendor, the administration of the county is authorized to negotiate with such local bidder to match the lowest bid supplied by a nonlocal vendor. Negotiation is limited to purchases and contracts up to $100,000.00 and is not authorized in situations where state or federal laws do not allow vendor preferences. If a local bidder matches the lowest bid, including all other terms and conditions of the bid, then the local vendor will be awarded the contract. If the bids of more than one local vendor are within five percent of the lowest overall bid of a nonlocal vendor, the local vendor with the lowest bid price will be given the first opportunity to match the lowest overall bid. If this local vendor declines to match such bid, then the vendors with the next lowest bid within five percent will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid. This process will continue with all local vendors having bids within five percent of the lowest overall bid by a nonlocal vendor.
(9)
Indebted vendors. No bid shall be accepted nor any purchase made through any local or nonlocal vendor which owes real or personal, state, county, or school district ad valorem taxes to the county at the time of such sale.
