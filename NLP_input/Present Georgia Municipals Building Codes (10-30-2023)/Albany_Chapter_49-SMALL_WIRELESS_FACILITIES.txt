If the wireless provider fails to relocate a support structure or pole or fails to provide a written good faith estimate of the time needed to relocate a support structure or pole within the time period prescribed in subsection (d)(13), the city shall have the right and privilege, ten days or more after the wireless provider receives written notice from the city, to cut power to or move any support structure or pole located within the right-of-way, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in order to commence work on the public project.
(17)
a.
If a wireless provider decides to abandon any small wireless facility, support structure, or pole, it shall notify the city in writing as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days prior to abandonment. Following receipt of such notice, the city shall instruct the wireless provider in writing to remove all or any portion of the small wireless facility, support structure, or pole if the city determines that such removal will be in the best interest of public safety and welfare. If the wireless provider fails to remove the abandoned small wireless facility support structure, or pole within 90 days after such notice, the city may do so and recover the actual and reasonable expenses of doing so from with wireless provider, its successors, or its assigns, plus a penalty not to exceed $500.00. The city may suspend the ability of the wireless provider, its successors, or its assigns, as applicable to receive any new permits from the city until the wireless provider, its successors, or its assigns, as applicable, have paid the amount assessed for such removal costs and the penalty assessed, if any: provided, however that the city shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from adopting reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements that are not inconsistent with this subsection (17) with respect to the removal of abandoned small wireless facilities, support structures, or poles.
b.
A small wireless facility that is not operated or a support structure or pole that is not utilized for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such small wireless facility, support structure, or pole shall remove such within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the city notifying such owner of such small wireless facility, support structure, or pole of the abandonment. The city shall send the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to such owner at the last known address of such owner of the small wireless facility, support structure, or pole. If the owner does not provide written notice that the small wireless facility has not been out of operation or the support structure or pole has in fact been utilized for a continuous period of 12 months or does not remove such small wireless facility, support structure, or pole within the 90 day period, the city may remove or cause the removal of such small wireless facility, support structure, or pole pursuant to the terms of its support structure or pole attachment agreement for city poles or through actions provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
(18)
If the city determines that a wireless provider's activity in a right-of-way pursuant to this chapter creates an imminent risk to public safety, the city may provide written notice to the wireless provider and demand that the wireless provider address such risk. If the wireless provider fails to reasonably address the risk within 24 hours of the written notice. The city may take or cause to be taken action to reasonably address such risk and charge the wireless provider the reasonable documented cost of such actions.
(19)
The city may require a wireless provider to repair all damage to a right-of-way directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider, while occupying, installing, repairing, or maintaining small wireless facilities, poles, or support structures, in such right-of-way and to restore the right-of-way to its condition before the damage occurred pursuant to the competitively neutral and reasonable requirements and specifications of the city. If the wireless provider fails to return the right-of-way, to the extent practicable in the reasonable judgment of the city, to its condition prior to the damage within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the city, the city may, at its sole discretion, restore the right-of-way to such condition and charge the wireless provider its reasonable, documented cost of doing so, plus a penalty not to exceed $500.00. The city may suspend the ability of the wireless provider to receive any new permits from the city until the wireless provider has paid the amount assessed for such restoration costs and the penalty assessed, if any; provided, however, that the city shall not suspend such ability of any applicant that has deposited the amount in controversy in escrow pending an adjudication of the merits of the dispute by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the city and a wireless provider from voluntarily entering one or more such agreements, including such agreements with rates, fees, and other terms that differ from those in this chapter; provided, however, that the city shall make each such agreement available for public inspection and available for adoption upon the same terms and conditions to any requesting wireless provider.
(b)
Absent an agreement to the contrary that is made public and that is available for adoption upon the same terms and conditions to any requesting wireless provider, an authority shall not require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the collocation for which approval is sought, such as in-kind contributions to the authority, including reserving fiber, conduit, or space on a utility pole or a wireless support structure for the authority, and such authority may not require an application to transfer small wireless facilities, poles, decorative poles, or support structures to the authority, provided that the authority may require transfer of an authority pole replaced by the applicant to accommodate its collocation.
