ARTICLE XIII. - VARIANCES

Sec. 26-353. - Purpose.
The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of this chapter would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardship may result from the size, shape or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structure thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized or in a manner not authorized by this chapter. No variance may be granted for a self-imposed hardship.
