(b)
For purposes of this section:
(1)
The terms `Tract,' `Block,' and `VTD' shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia;
(2)
The term `Precinct' is synonymous with the term `voting precinct' and means a geographical area designated by Article 7 of Chapter 2 or 3 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., within which all electors vote at one polling place;
(3)
Precinct names and designations following VTD designations are included for convenience only; and in the event the description of any commissioner district contains a conflict between the geographical boundaries of any VTD and the boundaries of the following named precinct, the geographical boundary of the VTD as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia shall control;
(4)
Any part of Colquitt County which is not included in any commissioner district described in this section shall be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; and
(5)
Any part of Colquitt County which is described in this section as being included in a particular commissioner district shall nevertheless not be included within such commissioner district if such part is not contiguous to such commissioner district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia.
