ARTICLE 6. - DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AND PLAN APPROVAL

Sec. 601. - Purpose and Intent.
The purpose of this Article is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of development through the submittal of an application for development permit and development plan review and approval.
Sec. 602. - Development Permit and Development Plan Approval Required.
Any development or land-disturbing activity shall require the submission of an application for development permit and development plans for review and approval, unless specifically exempted by this Ordinance. These requirements shall specifically include but not be limited to clearing and grubbing, grading, and the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, stormwater drainage facilities, sidewalks, or other structures permanently placed on or in the property except for buildings, signs, or other structures requiring the issuance of a building permit. Any person seeking development activity on land within the City shall first submit to the Zoning Administrator an application for a development permit, including all civil design and construction drawings required by this Ordinance.
The Zoning Administrator must first approve a development permit prior to the initiation of any development or land disturbing or construction activities, unless specifically exempted by this Ordinance.
Sec. 603. - Pre-Application Conference.
Whenever a person proposes the development of land, he is encouraged (but not required) to consult early and informally with the Zoning Administrator. The prospective developer may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and its vicinity, and the proposed layout of the development. This pre-application conference is intended to permit an early evaluation of the developer's intentions, to ensure coordination with the Comprehensive Plan of the City, and to provide the developer with the necessary laws, rules, and regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed development. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review, and no formal application shall be required.
Sec. 604. - Development Permit Application.
Applications for a development permit shall include the following:
(a)
Application form. A properly completed application form, as furnished by the Zoning Administrator, requesting review for project approval.
(b)
Site plan providing information on the property to be developed, based on a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor.
(c)
Copies of plans. A set number, as fixed from time to time by the Zoning Administrator, of copies of the development plans required by this Article and meeting specifications of this Article.
(d)
Fees. Payment of all applicable application and review fees, as established by the Governing Body from time to time.
(e)
Plat or plan prior approvals or applications. A copy of the approved preliminary plat, if subdivision is required and preliminary plat approval has been obtained, or an application for preliminary plat approval.
(f)
Standard drawings and construction specifications. When the subdivision or development involves an improvement for which a standard has not been established in this ordinance, or adopted by reference to another set of standards or specifications, the Zoning Administrator may require the application for development include standard drawings and construction specifications.
The application shall be checked for completeness at the time of submission. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant.
Sec. 605. - Relationship to Design Review and Approval.
An application for development permit may be processed independently or in conjunction with an application for design review and approval as specified in Article 40 of the Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance. Applicants are cautioned, however, that the design review and approval process is discretionary with regard to consistency with the comprehensive plan and design requirements of the Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance, and therefore, proceeding simultaneously with design plan and development permit applications may result in the revision of civil engineering drawings and construction plans if the layout of the development considered during design review must be significantly modified.
If type 2 (public) design review and approval is required, the design review process will be coordinated with the procedures for development permit approval as considered appropriate by the Zoning Administrator.
Sec. 606. - Types of Plans Required.
The civil design and construction drawings for a project shall conform in all respects with the approved preliminary plat, if applicable, and all other requirements of this Ordinance. Applications for approval of civil design and construction drawings shall include each of the plans described in this Section, if required, which shall not be considered limiting:
(a)
Erosion and sediment control plan. Plans must show proposed grading and land disturbance and be prepared to meet the erosion and sedimentation control requirements using best management practices under the City of Flowery Branch's Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance.
(b)
Tree protection and landscaping. Development plans shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Article 19 of the Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance, including but not limited to the protection of trees during development, the designation and protection of buffers, and submission of a landscaping plan.

If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate development permit shall be required for each phase.
Sec. 609. - Review of Development Permit Applications.
The Zoning Administrator may forward a copy of the development permit application, including the civil design and constructions drawings for the project, to other City departments and government agencies or others as appropriate, for their review and comment.

The Zoning Administrator shall have thirty (30) calendar days to accomplish the interagency review, if appropriate, and to certify compliance of the development plans with subdivision and land development requirements and the Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance; provided, however, that when development plan approval is required by a state or federal agency or another Department of the City of Flowery Branch, or in other cases with consent of the applicant, review may be extended. Although review may have been achieved, if another city department or external agency requires approval or permit, the applicant shall also be responsible for obtaining approval from all other agencies affected by the project prior to issuance of the development permit by the Zoning Administrator.
Sec. 610. - Issuance of Development Permit.
(a)
Issuance. Upon approval or conditional approval of development plans, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a development permit. Issuance of a development permit shall constitute authorization for the applicant to begin land-disturbing activities and the construction of improvements in accordance with approved plan.

Approval. If approved or conditionally approved, the Zoning Administrator shall provide his signature on said approved plans indicating said approval, retain two copies of said plans for records, and return one copy to the applicant.
(c)
Denial. The only basis upon which the Zoning Administrator may deny a development plan is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this Ordinance, the Flowery Branch Zoning Ordinance, or other applicable laws, or the failure of the development plan to be consistent with preliminary plat approval, if required.
