(Ord. of 1-23-1995, § M)
Sec. 62-82. - Findings.
The City of Snellville Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
Snellville is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout Snellville.
(2)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Snellville hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Snellville is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the City Charter of Snellville to provide for stormwater collection and disposal.
(4)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within Snellville.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Snellville and surrounding areas.
(6)
Snellville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(7)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the county thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(8)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area water bodies.
(9)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e., National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase I Stormwater Permit under which the City operates] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(10)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase I Stormwater Permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities.
(11)
The cost of operating and maintaining the Snellville stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(12)
The professional engineering, and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(13)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(14)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(15)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways.
(16)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof.
(17)
A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms.
(18)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(19)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property.
(20)
The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(21)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 1, 5-12-2008)
Sec. 62-83. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto.
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property.
Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff from private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities.
Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces.
Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition.
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48-inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The Snellville Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose.
Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city.
Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to:
(1)
Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city;
(2)
Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities;
(3)
Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;
(4)
Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and
(5)
Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements.
(6)
Education of the public as to stormwater issues.
(7)
Inspection and monitoring of water quantity or quality to require compliance with state or local standards and stormwater management programs.
(8)
Such other services as the stormwater utility manager may deem appropriate.
Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof.
Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff.
Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Snellville Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by Snellville for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered.
Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed or hired by the city manager or the entity selected by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article.
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface.
User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 1, 5-12-2008)
Sec. 62-84. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established.
(a)

(c)
It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(d)
If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents.
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 1, 5-12-2008)
Sec. 62-86. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 1, 5-12-2008)
Sec. 62-87. - Stormwater user fee charges authorized.
(a)
The stormwater utility manager is authorized to impose a service charge on each user of the stormwater system pursuant to the terms of this section. The stormwater user fee charge and rate structure may be amended from time to time by official action of the mayor and council. The stormwater utility manager shall review the stormwater user fee charge and rate structure on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the mayor and council.
(b)
For purposes of this article, an ERU shall be equivalent to 3,800 square feet of impervious property. ERU or "equivalent runoff unit" shall mean the average impervious area of a single-family detached residential dwelling unit located within the city as periodically determined and established as provided in this article. ERU rate shall mean the dollar value periodically determined and assigned to each ERU as a charge for stormwater services, and expressed as a dollar value per ERU per month.
(c)

(e)
Any changes to the stormwater user fee shall be accomplished by adoption of a resolution of the mayor and council.
(f)
No revenues generated by the stormwater enterprise user fee shall be used for any purpose other than stormwater expenses.
(g)
The stormwater fee for single-family residential property shall be the following percentage of the ERU rate:
EXPAND
Impervious Area of the Property (square feet) Percentage of
ERU Rate
Tier 1 (up to 2,850 square feet) 75%
Tier 2 (2,851 - 4,750 square feet) 100%
Tier 3 (greater than 4,750 square feet) 125%
  (h)
Commercial properties shall be billed one ERU for each 3,800 square feet, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for commercial properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a commercial property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the user will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU.
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 1, 5-12-2008; Ord. No. 2009-02, § 1, 3-23-2009)

(8)
If the stormwater utility manager, or their designee has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the stormwater utility manager, or their designee is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then upon obtaining the written approval of the city manager the stormwater utility manager, or their designee may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the violation, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private stormwater system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate any public nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater utility manager shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the violation. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater utility manager shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater utility manager determines that the violation presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record.

Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either cure the violation or file a written request with city for a hearing before the city manager pursuant section 62-89 to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the article.
(d)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager or if a property owner fails to cure a violation pursuant to subsection (c) above, the city may elect to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate such public nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Clerk of Gwinnett Superior Court.
