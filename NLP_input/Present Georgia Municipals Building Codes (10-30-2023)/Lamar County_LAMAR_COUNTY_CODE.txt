PREFACE
The Lamar County Code of Laws consists of two parts: Part I, Local Legislation, being a compilation of local legislation relating to Lamar County adopted by the General Assembly which were deemed advisable to be included; Part II, County Legislation, being a codification of legislation adopted by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners which is of a general and permanent nature.
As this volume contains three (3) distinct parts, each chapter is preceded by an arabic number designating the part. Thus, the second chapter of Part I (Local Legislation) is Chapter 1-2, and the second chapter of Part II (County Ordinances) is Chapter 2-2. Section numbers are keyed to chapters so the first section of Chapter 1-2 is section 1-2-1 and the first section of Chapter 2-1 is section 2-1-1.
Under this system each section is identified with its part and chapter number and any additions can be inserted in their proper place by the use of the decimal system. New material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-3-2 and 2-3-3 would be designated as sections 2-3-2.1, 2-3-2.2 and 2-3-2.3, respectively. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions for future expansion. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2-15 and 2-16 it will be designated as Chapter 2-15.5. New articles and new divisions may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Footnotes which tie related sections of this volume together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within this volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables, any local constitutional amendment, local act or ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code.
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by county officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
The publication of this Code was under the supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Norman Smith, County Attorney, and Mr. Robert Zellner, County Administrator, and to other county officers and employees too numerous to mention, for their invaluable cooperation and assistance in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication.
