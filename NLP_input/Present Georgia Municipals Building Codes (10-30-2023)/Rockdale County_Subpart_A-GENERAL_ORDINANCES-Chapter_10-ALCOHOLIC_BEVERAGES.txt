Sec. 10-55. - Prohibition of alcoholic beverages with nudity or in adult entertainment establishments.
(a)
The regulations that follow and that otherwise are contained in this Code regarding adult entertainment establishments constitute content-neutral requirements that have been carefully designed to minimize adverse impacts caused by secondary effects of these establishments. The county finds that studies in other jurisdictions demonstrating a correlation between these establishments and such negative secondary effects as diminishing market values in neighboring residential and related areas, increasing crime rates, difficulty in securing residential and related financing, an influx of patrons to these establishments from outside the immediate neighboring areas, and similar negative effects, are pertinent and relevant to the situation that exists in the county. These studies, as well as other evidence from the public and professional staff, have been carefully reviewed by the county prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. The county further finds that there is evidence considered by the county prior to adoption of these and other county regulations regarding the combined effects of adult entertainment establishments and alcohol, and showing that the combination of such activities create additional pernicious secondary effects upon surrounding communities. The county finds that adoption of regulations restricting these establishments to certain districts, barring alcohol sales within such establishments, and imposing distance and development standards is consistent with the general comprehensive planning standards and policies of the county, will reduce the negative secondary effects caused by these establishments, and will afford protection to residential uses and other uses consistent with residential uses so as to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morality while respecting and protecting the free speech rights of these establishments. The regulations in this section are adopted pursuant to, inter alia, Ga. Const. art. III, § VI, VII.
(b)
The definitions contained in this article and in section 22-142 shall apply to this section.
(c)
No person, association, partnership or corporation holding a license under chapter 22, article V, shall serve, sell, distribute or allow the consumption or possession of any alcoholic beverage or illegal controlled substance upon the premises of any such licensed establishment.
(d)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, including but not limited to employees or an independent contractor engaged in the sale or service of food or beverages, or promotions, contests, sales, or special events, in which such person, whether an employee, or an independent contractor, patron, customer, or otherwise, exposes any portion of his specified anatomical areas as defined in section 22-142, shall be prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcoholic beverages within the county. Such conduct shall constitute grounds for suspension and revocation of the alcoholic beverage license of any establishment licensed pursuant to this article.
(e)
This section shall not apply or prohibit the live performance of legitimate plays, operas, musicals, or ballets at mainstream theaters, concert halls, museums or licensed educational institutions, which derive less than 20 percent of yearly gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages.

(e)

At the request of the license holder, a hearing shall be held at a special meeting of the board of commissioners to be called within seven days after such request is filed with the county. The board of commissioners shall affirm or reverse the suspension, suspend for a definite period, or revoke the license permanently after hearing the evidence at the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners.
