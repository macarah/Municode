ARTICLE III. - INDIGENT BURIALS

Sec. 22-221. - County policy.
The following are the guidelines, which the county uses for those unable to pay funeral expenses. The county believes in the reverence and dignity of the deceased and will always hold the utmost respect for both the deceased and their families.
(1)
Because the primary responsibility is with the family, the county will not become involved unless there is truly a need. As with any expenditure by the county government, we are held accountable to the taxpayers of the county. In any situation where indigent services are requested, certain criteria must be met and an affidavit signed stating the deceased is truly indigent and no family member is capable of paying funeral expenses. The county Staff will also utilize DFACS as a source to verify indigent status.
(2)
The request for these services must be made only when there is truly an indigent need and the funeral director and/or the county commissioners must be made fully aware of the financial circumstances of the parties involved. After consideration of these circumstances, the request will be considered.
(3)
Should the county accept responsibility, the following services and merchandise will be provided at a cost not to exceed $500.00:
a.
Removal of remains.
b.
Embalming with no restoration.
c.
Minimum casket.
d.
Open and close grave.
e.
Graveside service.
f.
Two-hour visitation, same day as service.
(4)
In the event that the provided services exceed $500.00, the county reserves the right to remove one or more items from the list.
(5)
Anything other than the items listed above must be paid for in advance by the family of the deceased. If you choose to upgrade the services and merchandise, this agreement is void and the family is responsible for all expenses.
(6)
Cremation is an acceptable practice and if it is the family's desire, it will be considered as an option.
