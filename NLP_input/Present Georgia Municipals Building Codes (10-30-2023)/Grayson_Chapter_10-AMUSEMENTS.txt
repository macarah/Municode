Editor's note— Section 10-30 "Findings," the introductory language of the city's adult entertainment ordinance of November 4, 1996, is included here at the request of the city.

Sec. 10-30. - Findings.
(a)
The mayor and council find that adult entertainment facilities, if unregulated, may lead to an increase in prostitution, venereal and other sexually transmitted disease, drug and alcohol offenses and other criminal activity.
(b)
The law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment facilities are limited and are conserved by regulating the location of adult entertainment facilities.
(c)
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; City of Smyrna, Georgia; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach Florida; and South Bend, Indiana, which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such other bodies, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(d)
It is the finding of the mayor and council that based on subsections (a)—(c) of this section public nudity and seminudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale of and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas.
(e)
The mayor and council have reviewed or caused to be reviewed certain decisions of the appellate courts, including but not limited to Paramount Pictures Corporation v. Busbee, et al., 252 Ga. 250 (1982); Harris v. Entertainment Systems, Inc., 259 Ga. 701 (1989); Yarbrough v. City of Carrollton, 262 Ga. 444 (1992); Pel Asso., Inc. v. Joseph, 262 Ga. 904 (1993); and Gravely v. Bacon, 263 Ga. 203 (1993); World Famous Dudley's Food and Spirits, Inc. v. City of College Park, 265 Ga. 618 (1995) and Parker v. Whitfield Co., 265 Ga. 829 (1995).
(f)
The public health, safety, welfare and convenience require that the location of adult entertainment facilities shall be regulated in order to reduce the potential for harm, and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community.
(g)
The location of an adult entertainment facility and like or associated businesses in the same neighborhood or in close proximity of the same tend to attract an undesirable quantity and quality of transients, adversely affecting property values, cause an increase in crime and encourage residents and businesses therein to move elsewhere.
(Ord. of 11-4-1996(1), intro. ¶)
Sec. 10-31. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
