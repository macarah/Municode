It is the policy of the Berrien County board of commissioners to provide vehicles for business use, to allow employees to drive on county business, and to reimburse employees for the business use of personal vehicles according to the following guidelines:
1.
Employees may not drive vehicles for county business without the prior approval of their supervisor. Before approving a driver, the supervisor must check the employee's driving record to verify the existence of a valid driver's license and to insure the employee is eligible for coverage under all applicable county insurance.
2.
Employees holding positions designated as requiring regular driving for the county as a condition of employment must be able to meet the approved driver standards of this policy at all times. In addition, such employees must inform their supervisors of any changes that may affect their ability to meet the standards of this policy. For all other positions, driving is considered only a minor function of the position.
3.
County vehicles will be assigned to those departments which have demonstrated a continuing need for them. Additional vehicles are maintained in a motor pool for use as needed.
4.
Employees who need transportation in the course of their normal work may be assigned a county vehicle. All other employees requiring transportation for county business may use vehicles assigned to their department or those maintained in the county motor pool. As a last alternative, when no county vehicles are available, employees may use their own vehicles for county business purposes, but only with the prior approval of their supervisor/chairman/constitutional officer.
5.
Employees who drive a vehicle on county business must, in addition to meeting the approval requirements above, must exercise due diligence to drive safely and to maintain the security of the vehicle and its contents.

Employees are also responsible for any driving violations or fines as a result of their driving.
6.
Employees are not permitted under any circumstance to operate a county vehicle or a personal vehicle for county business when any physical or mental impairment causes the employee to be unable to drive safely. This prohibition includes, but is no limited to, circumstances in which the employee is temporarily unable to operate a vehicle safely or legally due to illness, medication, or intoxication.
7.
Employees may use county vehicles for non-county business purposes only with the prior approval of their supervisor or the chairman/constitutional officer.

Employees driving on county business may claim reimbursement for parking fees and tolls actually incurred.

All requests for reimbursement must be approved by the employees supervisor and the chairman/constitutional officer.

Employees who use their personal vehicle for approved county business will receive $.28 per mile reimbursement. This reimbursement is to compensate for the cost of gasoline, oil, maintenance, and insurance.
10.
Employees must report any accident, theft, or damage involving a county vehicle or a personal vehicle used on county business to their supervisor and the chairman regardless of the extent of damage or lack of injuries.

DISCIPLINARY ACTION
The county believes in a fair, positive, and a firm approach to issues of discipline. Disciplinary action shall be applied promptly on the base of facts without favoritism or discrimination.
Disciplinary action will be viewed as an attempt to change unacceptable work and/or personal behavior and to serve, motivate, and encourage the affected employee to become a more productive person.

1.
Verbal warning. In the event of unsatisfactory employee conduct of a minor nature, the county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall inform the employee promptly and specifically of the undesirable conduct and shall give counsel and assistance in correcting that behavior. A written record showing the date, time, and reason for the verbal warning shall be completed by the person issuing the warning following the discussion with the employee.

The original completed form shall be sent to the commissioner's office for placement in the employee's personnel file.
2.
Written reprimand. In situations where a verbal warning has not resulted in the expected improvement or where more severe action is warranted, a written reprimand may be issued to the employee by the county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor.

After discussing with the employee his or her unacceptable behavior or action, a copy of the written reprimand shall be provided to the employee and he/she shall be asked to sign the form acknowledging that he/she has received a copy of the form.

The original completed form shall be forwarded to the commissioner's office for placement in the employee's personnel file.
3.
Suspension. In situations where verbal warnings and the required written reprimands have not resulted in improvement or where more severe action is warranted, a suspension without pay may be issued. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor who discovers a violation warranting a suspension, demotion, or dismissal shall immediately stop the infraction and submit a completed recommendation for disciplinary form found in the appendix section of this manual. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall take the appropriate disciplinary action and forward said original form to the commissioner's office to be placed in the employee's personnel file.
4.
Demotion. In situations where verbal and written reprimands or suspensions have not resulted in the expected improvements or where more severe action is warranted, the employee may be demoted if a vacant position is available. A demotion is an involuntary reduction in the classification and job duties of the employee for just cause. A demotion may result in a reduction of pay. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall initiate the demotion in the same manner as provided for as a suspension.
5.
Dismissal. In situations where verbal and written reprimands, suspensions and/or demotions have not resulted in the expected improvement or where more severe action is warranted because of the offense, the employee may be discharged. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall handle the dismissal process in the same manner as a suspension.
B.
Notice and appeals:
1.
The employee shall be provided a written disciplinary meeting notice (see appendix) anytime a disciplinary hearing is held which may result in a suspension, demotion or dismissal.

2.
The employee shall be asked to sign the original notice as acknowledgment of having received a copy. The original shall be placed in the employee's personnel file in the commissioner's office.

The board of county commissioners may, but shall not be required to, hold another hearing and receive additional evidence.
5.
All county employees are responsible for knowing and understanding the rules and penalties to be applied for violations of any of these rules.
C.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
A.
[Requirements and procedures.] This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for evaluating the job performance of all, nonelected county employees.
B.
[Purpose.] The county's performance evaluation program is intended to be a system of communication among the board of county commissioners/constitutional officer/department supervisor and the employee. Positively and conscientiously applied, it can improve employee performance and morale by recognizing skills and strengths while constructively remedying short comings and weaknesses. It will also strengthen supervisory skills and identify areas in which training at either level would be beneficial. The ratings themselves will be useful in evaluation of potential candidates for promotion, in addition an intricate part of layoff procedures if such action becomes necessary.
C.
Types of evaluation.
1.
Employees serving initial or promotion probationary periods should receive at least two probationary evaluations during the course of such period. The first should be completed approximately halfway through the probationary period; the second no later than seven days prior to the completion of the probationary period. The appropriate supervisor may utilize fewer evaluations depending upon the applicant's prior qualifications and his/her length of probation. The first evaluation is intended to provide the employee timely information regarding the adequacy of his/her job performance. If the probationary performance is found to be unsatisfactory, the second evaluation should detail the reasons as specifically as possible.
2.
Employees not in probationary periods shall receive at least one performance evaluation per year which is to be completed 30 days prior to any scheduled salary adjustments.
3.
Employees may be given a special evaluation at the discretion of the chairman/constitutional officer or department supervisor. Such evaluations are to be used for internal department purposes (i.e., a supervisor leaving may want to evaluate his/her employees to assist an incoming supervisor, etc.).
D.
Rating procedure.
1.
Each county employee should be rated by the appropriate constitutional officer/department supervisor. Extreme care must be taken by each rater to insure fair and impartial ratings. Employees are to be rated on their performance over the entire rating period. The supervisor must discuss the rating with the employee, in addition to signing, and dating the form (see appendix of this manual).
2.
If an employee has been assigned or transferred to another department, both immediate supervisors should cooperate in completing the form which will require the new rater's (supervisor's) signature.
3.
The rater must discuss the evaluation with the employee in a private, unhurried, and uninterrupted session. The appropriate supervisor, may request the chairman to be present at the evaluation meeting. Areas of strength should be reviewed and highlighted as well as areas of weakness with employee. In addition, a constructive discussion on how to improve job performance should be included in the session. The employee should sign and date the evaluation form. If the employee refuses to sign the form, the rater should so indicate at the bottom of the signature page. The employee may comment in writing on any area(s) of disagreement with the ratings given. The employee's written comments will be attached to the evaluation form. Ratings shall not be changed once the employee has signed the form.
4.
Finally, the form is reviewed by the appropriate appointing authority. The final probationary evaluation must indicate either the employee should be retained or removed. The originals of all forms will be forwarded to the county clerk's office for placement in the employee's personnel file. In all cases, a copy of the evaluation must be returned to the employee.
E.
Employee appeals.
1.
The rater must advise any employee who disagrees with the performance evaluation ratings of his/her right to appeal such ratings.
2.
Such appeal will be reviewed internally by the chairman.
3.
The rater should impartially consider the employee's objections during the initial employee discussion. Unknown facts of problems that would warrant rating changes may be presented by the employee during the discussion. When a rating change is warranted, the rater may either complete a new performance evaluation form or cross out the old rating and mark the new one.
4.
If not resolved, the appeal may be forwarded to the board of county commissioners; whenever applicable.

TEMPORARY AND PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
A.
It is the policy of Berrien County to supplement the regular work force with temporary, part-time, or intermittent employees, or other forms of flexible staffing, when needed because of periods of peak work load, employee absences, or other situations as may be determined by the board of county commissioners.
B.
A temporary employee is an individual who is hired either part-time or full-time for a specified, limited period.

An intermittent employee is an individual who is hired on a yearround basis and is subject to fill in occasionally for regular employees or during peak work load periods. Other flexible staffing classifications or arrangements may be added as needed.
C.
Temporary and part-time positions will be filled as follows, if circumstances permit:

F.
Eligibility of temporary and part-time employees for paid absences, vacations, and holidays is governed by the individual policies contained in this manual. An employee whose status changes from full-time to part-time may use any days of paid absence or vacation earned as a full-time employee. An employee whose status changes from temporary or part-time to full-time will be considered as hired on the date of the change of status for purposes of eligibility for paid absences and vacation. Information concerning eligibility of temporary and part-time employees for other county benefits, is available in the county clerk's office.
TIME CLOCKS
A.
It is the policy of the county to establish the use of time clocks for all hourly employees of the county that are paid under Berrien County's Employer Taxpayer Identification Number. Time cards cover one week work period and must be completed by the close of each workday.
