Sec. 70-186. - Residential equivalent units.
(a)
A residential equivalent unit is that portion of a user's facility that has an impact on the water and wastewater system equivalent to a single-family residence. The determination of a facility's residential equivalent units shall be based on estimated water consumption as shown in guidelines below or on square footage. Peak water consumption of 300 gallons per day or a floor space of 3,000 square feet, shall be the equivalent of one residential unit. The method which results in the greater number of equivalent residential units shall be applied. The standards in the table below shall be used in the determination of water consumption. If the table does not provide information for a particular application, the estimated water consumption shall be as calculated by the director in accordance with sound engineering practices using information available from the state EPD, USEPA, or standard reference materials commonly used for estimating flows.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 70-301. - Stormwater utility established.
new
There is established a stormwater utility to be known as the "City of Darien Stormwater Utility," which shall be responsible for stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 2022-09, § I(Exh. A), 8-16-2022)
Sec. 70-302. - Purpose.
new
The city is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, article IX, section II, paragraphs II and III(a)(6) thereof and state law, to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the city. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff.
The city council has determined that development in the city to date, and development in the future, has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city. The city has engaged a consultant to perform a stormwater utility feasibility study of the city's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the city for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the city for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the city to support such costs. The city council finds and concludes from the stormwater utility feasibility study that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city.
The city council finds and concludes from the stormwater utility feasibility study that a fair and equitable rate structure for those owners of developed property in the city receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the city stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the city is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the city.

Sec. 70-303. - Findings.
new
The city council makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
The city is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, article IX, section II, paragraphs II and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city.
(2)
The management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the city is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of all residents and businesses in the city.
(3)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten to potentially damage businesses and residences, and other facilities and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city.
(4)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(5)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by the city by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(6)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements being imposed on the city's wastewater treatment facilities.
(7)
The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.) (the "Act"),and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act imposed by regulatory obligations of its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit require the city to reduce pollution in its stormwater discharge and increase water quality to the maximum extent practicable.
(8)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in the city. The city has two rivers and streams listed as impaired waters by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, or other appropriate authorities pursuant to section 303(d) of the Act.
(9)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for drainage and flood control.
(10)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(11)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(12)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of the City to provide for stormwater collection and disposal (Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, lll(a)(6)).
(13)
The city fully incorporates by reference into these findings the stormwater utility feasibility study, said document is on file in the office of the city manager.
(14)
The stormwater utility feasibility study conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the city.
(15)
Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the stormwater utility feasibility study submitted to the city, the city determines to establish a stormwater utility within the city that is dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(16)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city. Development in the city has altered the natural hydrology with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities. Even areas of the city that remain less densely developed and rural in character with natural stormwater drainage predominating, demand services along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, stormwater management services systems and facilities needs apply to all areas of the city.
(17)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems, facilities and regulation of their use renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of city, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the stormwater utility feasibility study.
(18)
The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties owned impose on the city's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(19)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(20)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the city through stormwater management charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described more fully herein.
(21)
A schedule of stormwater utility management charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city. Such charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the city council.
(22)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which significantly reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city and as set forth herein.
(23)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating periodic stormwater management charges.
(24)
In addition to impervious area, the amount and types of pollutants that are carried by stormwater runoff is closely tied to the use of the property. Sampling of stormwater runoff from across the United States has demonstrated that the runoff from the more heavily used property, such as commercial and industrial developments, contain greater quantities of pollutants than less intensely developed residential properties. The water quality component of the city's stormwater program will concentrate more heavily in those areas where the land use of the properties generates the greatest quantity of pollutants which may be reflected in the stormwater quality charge of those properties.
(25)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and the council directs that such proceeds of charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be disbursed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

(c)
To the extent practicable, credits against the stormwater service charge and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 2022-09, § I(Exh. A), 8-16-2022)
Sec. 70-308. - Stormwater utility rates.
new
(a)
Stormwater utility rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city council to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities to those property owners who benefit therefrom, and which, together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, nonoperating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city council.
(b)
The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services to all developed property within the city is established under this section. The amount of charge to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for the calculation of charges, the creation of customer classifications for the imposition of charges, and changes in such charges, formulas and customer classifications may be made by further resolution of the city council. All charges established pursuant to this section shall be fair and reasonable.
(c)
The director shall assign a customer classification to all developed property within the city. The director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area, land area, land use or other factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the stormwater fee based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, date supplied by the county board of assessors, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or developer. The director may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. The billing amount shall be updated by the director based on any additions to the impervious area as approved through the building permit process.
(d)
Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs of the stormwater utility. Such charges, established herein, may include the following components:
(1)
Base charge. A base charge may be imposed on all developed property in the city. The base charge represents each customer's fair share of the cost of the management and operation of the city's stormwater management program. The base charge is based on the ERU and is calculated using the formula identified in subsection (e) of this section.
(2)
Stormwater service charge. The stormwater service charge may be imposed on all developed property in city. It represents the city's capital cost that results in properly designed and maintained stormwater management facilities. The stormwater service charge shall be charged to collect sufficient revenue to fund the debt service for capital improvements, the capital replacement reserve, and the small/emergency project reserve. The stormwater service charge shall be charged based the ERU and is calculated using the formula identified in subsection (e) of this section.
(e)
Calculation of charges.
(1)
The monthly stormwater utility charges imposed to recover the cost of the stormwater utility program are as follows:
EXPAND
Base Charge ERU x $2.50 per month
Stormwater Service Charge ERU x $1.00 per month
Total Stormwater Management Charge $3.50 per ERU per month
  (2)
Estimating the equivalent runoff unit:
a.
The basis of the stormwater utility fee shall be the equivalent runoff unit (ERU).
b.
An ERU will represent 2,635 square feet of impervious area.
c.
The director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area and other required information for each developed property in city based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the county assessor, aerial photography, the property owner, developer or other method as may be required. The number of ERUs that will form the basis of the base charge and stormwater service charge shall be established in the following manner and based on the definitions set forth in section 70-304:
1.
Small single-family—The charges shall be equal to 0.6 ERUs.
2.
Medium single-family—The charges shall be equal to 1.0 ERU.
3.
Large single-family—The charges shall be equal to 1.7 ERUs.
4.
Other developed property ("other")—The charges shall be equal to the total impervious area of the property divided by the square footage of an ERU.
5.
Undeveloped—The charges shall be equal to zero ERUs and will not receive a stormwater utility bill.

Sec. 70-311. - Stormwater management charges billing, delinquencies and collections.
new
(a)
Billing.
(1)
Stormwater management charges shall begin to accrue September 1, 2022, and shall be billed in arrears. A bill for stormwater management charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater management charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. Any newly constructed structure which will normally and ordinarily be assessed a stormwater utility fee shall pay a monthly prorated portion of the fee, as calculated herein, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. A single day or more shall constitute a whole month for the purposes of this initial proration.
(2)
The stormwater management charge may be billed and collected separately, or pre-billed on the annual ad valorem tax bill clearly delineated as a fee, or along with water and sanitary sewer charges, or along with other fees for services, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager.
(3)
The stormwater management charge may be billed to the customer of record or the owner of the property, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager.
(4)
Frequency of the billing of stormwater management charges shall be specified by the city manager.
(5)
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater management charges shall be obligated to pay the stormwater management charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater management charge payments.
(6)
The owner of any property which is occupied by a customer of record shall have the right to examine, during normal business hours, the appropriate records of the city to determine whether such fees and charges have been paid.
(7)
If an account is underbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed land, the city stormwater utility may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the backbilled period.
(b)
Partial payment. A partial payment by a customer shall be allocated first to the past due amount of the account and then the current amount due for stormwater services, followed by the current amount due wastewater service, followed by the current amount due for sanitation services and finally to the amount due for water.
(c)
Delinquencies and collections.
(1)
Unpaid stormwater management charges shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. In no instance shall the unpaid stormwater charge constitute a direct lien against the property.
(2)
A ten percent penalty will be added for all stormwater service bills that are not paid by the 15th day of the current month's billing and an additional ten percent penalty will be assessed for each 30 days thereafter.
