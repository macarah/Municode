Sec. 98-2. - Parking.
(a)
How vehicles are to be parked.
(1)
Except as otherwise provided, every vehicle stopped or parked upon a two-way roadway shall be stopped or parked with the right-hand wheels parallel to and within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder.
(2)
Except when otherwise provided, every vehicle stopped or parked upon a one-way roadway shall be stopped or parked parallel to the curb or edge of the roadway, in the direction of authorized traffic movement, with its right-hand wheels within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder or with its left-hand wheels within 12 inches of the left-hand curb or as close as practicable to the left edge of the left-hand shoulder.
(3)
Angle parking on any municipal roadway may be permitted only if the city has determined that the roadway is of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic.
(4)
The city, with respect to municipal roadways under its jurisdiction, may place signs prohibiting, restricting, or limiting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles on any highway where, in its opinion, as evidenced by resolution or order entered in its minutes, such stopping, standing, or parking is dangerous to those using the roadway or where the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic thereon. Such signs shall be official signs, owned and maintained by the city, and no person shall stop, stand, or park any vehicle in violation of the restrictions on such signs.
(b)
Citizen request for a no parking zone.
(1)
Any citizen requesting a no parking zone shall do so through a written petition submitted to the city engineer or their designee which must be supported by the signatures of at least 70 percent of the owners of property abutting the street for which the no parking zone is requested. All property who will be affected by the proposed action should be contacted and given the opportunity to sign the petition, indicating their "yes" or "no" response concerning the designation of a no parking zone.
Once the petition has been submitted and validated by the city engineer the street will be reviewed, as soon as practical, to determine whether such parking is dangerous to those using the roadway or whether the parking of vehicles would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic thereon. If, in the city engineer's opinion, the street meets those criteria, and if all other laws and regulations have been met, the petition will be presented to the mayor and council at their regularly scheduled council meeting for consideration. The mayor and council may approve or disapprove the request under the criteria set forth above and this decision shall be final.
(c)
Removal of no parking zones and signs.
(1)
No parking zones and no parking signs may be removed only if the city, in its opinion, as evidenced by resolution or order entered in its minutes, determines that such parking is no longer dangerous to those using the roadway or that the parking of vehicles would no longer unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic thereon.
(d)
Exceptions.
(1)
Temporary exceptions to this section may be made by city staff for no more than consecutive 30 days, without council approval, to allow no parking zones to be established for matters of public safety, construction or engineer projects, or city sponsored functions. If those areas are to exceed 30 days, city staff will be required to submit a written request to the mayor and council to be considered under the criteria set forth herein.
