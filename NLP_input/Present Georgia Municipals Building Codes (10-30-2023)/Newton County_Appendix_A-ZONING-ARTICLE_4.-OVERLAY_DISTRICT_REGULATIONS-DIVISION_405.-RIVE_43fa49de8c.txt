DIVISION 405. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION OVERLAY

Sec. 405-010. - Purpose and intent.
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. ยง 12-2-8 and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division's Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria chapter 391-3-16, the river corridor protection overlay district establishes regulations to preserve rivers as habitats for wildlife, recreation sites, and sources of clean drinking water.
Sec. 405-020. - River corridor protection overlay district.
The river corridor protection overlay district includes all parcels or portions of parcels lying within a river corridor. For purposes of this ordinance, protected rivers shall include the Yellow River, South River, and Alcovy River and any other river meeting criteria as established by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The Newton County River Corridor Protection Overlay District Map is available for inspection during office hours in the Newton County Planning Department.
Sec. 405-030. - Permitted uses.
Except as noted below, the river corridor shall be maintained as a natural vegetative buffer and all construction within the buffer shall be prohibited:
A.
Single-family dwellings, subject to the state-mandated 25-foot stream buffer and subject further to the following conditions:
1.
The dwelling must be in compliance with all applicable zoning regulations.
2.
The dwelling must be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. No portion of the two acres may include any area that lies within the protected river.
3.
Only one such dwelling may be on the two-acre or larger tract of land.
4.
Septic tanks serving such dwellings may be located within the buffer.
5.
Septic tank drain fields shall not be located in the buffer.
B.
Industrial and commercial land uses existing prior to the establishment of the river corridor protection overlay district, subject to the following conditions:
1.
The industrial and commercial uses must not impair the drinking quality of the river water.
2.
The industrial and commercial uses must meet all state and federal environmental rules and regulations.
C.
Road and utility crossings provided the construction of such road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 and the applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control.
D.
The following uses of river corridors are permitted, provided that such uses do not impair the long-term functions of the protected river or the river corridor:
1.
Timber production and harvesting, subject to the following conditions:
a.
Timber production and harvesting must be consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission and all other state and federal regulations.
b.
Timber production and harvesting must not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
2.
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purpose of O.C.G.A. ยง 12-2-8.
3.
Wastewater treatment.
4.
Recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. For example, outdoor passive recreational activities such as fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating (including a boat launch ramp), horseback riding and canoeing would be consistent with the criteria, but a hard-surfaced tennis court would not. Parking lots are not consistent with this criterion.
5.
