(a)
Due cause for the suspension or revocation of the licenses identified in section 3-910 (Suspension or revocation; notice of hearing; refund), shall include a violation of any laws or ordinances regulating such business; or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business; or for the violation of any state or federal law; or for the violation of any city ordinances other than traffic ordinances or failure of licensee or employees to report promptly to the police department any violation of the law or ordinance, breach of the peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring inside the premises; or for any other legal and sufficient cause.
(b)
The violation of any term, condition or provision of this article in any particular, or as to any detail whatsoever, shall be cause for the suspension or revocation of any license as provided for in this article.
(c)
Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to manufacture or sell, at wholesale or retail, any alcoholic beverages, or suspend or revoke a state retail consumption dealer's license, said action shall automatically serve to suspend the applicable city license issued under the terms of this article pending a revocation as provided for in this article.
(d)
Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for a license permitting the consumption of alcohol on the premises hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license. Any failure to notify of the change in any relationship as specified in section 3-224 (change in relationships and/or ownership interest) within thirty (30) days within such change is made shall likewise constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder. Further, failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this article shall constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder.
(e)
Any licensed establishment that is found to be in violation of sections 3-350 (types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited) and 3-270 ("happy hour" promotions and sales) of this code shall be subject to immediate license suspension and the city clerk shall take action to revoke the license as provided for in this article, in addition to all other penalties provided for in this article.

(g)
The city clerk shall take action to revoke the license for any premises where alcoholic beverages have been sold or distributed during a period of suspension.
(h)
The city clerk may suspend or revoke the license of any establishment which does not meet the licensing qualifications set forth in this article any time such knowledge becomes known to him or her as provided for in this article.
(i)
In the case of an act of an employee, rather than the licensee, which presents cause for the suspension or revocation of a license, in determining whether to initiate such suspension or revocation hearings, the city clerk may take into consideration any documented evidence that the licensee has, on prior occasions, undertaken proactive efforts to promote compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the provisions of this chapter prohibiting the sale or serving of alcohol to minors. Documented evidence of such activities shall include, but shall not be limited to, written evidence that the licensee has promptly reported freely and of its own volition violations or attempted violations of this article.
