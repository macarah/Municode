Sec. 4-24. - Effect of prior criminal history; exceptions.

However, the 30 days of operation under the management agreement shall be counted as the first month of sales for the purposes of calculating the alcohol license fees that are due. If a violation of this chapter occurs during the 30 days that the business is operating under a management agreement pursuant to this section, both the prior licensee and the new applicant can be charged and held liable. Moreover, any such violation may serve as grounds for denial of the new license.

(1)
Three-fourths of the license fee if the licensee goes out of business during the first quarter of the calendar year.
