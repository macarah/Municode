Residential lots in floodplain. Residential subdivision lots shall be prohibited within floodplain areas where the cost of providing governmental services in the area would pose an unreasonable economic burden.
(6)
Width and area requirements. Lots hereafter established within subdivisions shall conform to the lot area as set forth in the general provisions for each zoning district and the lot width shall be a minimum of 60 feet at the building line.
(G)
Blocks. All blocks hereafter established within a subdivision shall conform to the following design standards.

Easement. The following kinds of easements shall be required within subdivisions:
(1)
Utility easements. Public utility easements shall be provided where necessary. Such easements shall be not less than 15 feet in width and shall be centered on side or rear property lines when possible. The location, elevation and construction of all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets, shall be in such a manner as to minimize or eliminate damage by flooding.
(2)
Drainage. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way which shall conform substantially with the lines of such watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream or shall be of such additional width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.
(3)
Maintenance easement. Where a drainage canal is such size that it requires mechanical means for cleaning, such as a dragline, there shall be a 12-foot access easement on either side of such canal for access purposes.
(I)
Water supply and sanitary sewage. Water and sewage facilities shall conform to the following requirements:
(1)
Public water and public sewer. When feasible every portion of a subdivision shall be served by public water; when feasible, as determined by the mayor and council, every portion of a subdivision shall be served by a sanitary sewer system.

(2)
Private water and private sewerage. Where either public water or public sewers or both are not available to a subdivision as determined by the mayor and council and a subdivider shall decide to establish a private water supply system and a private sewer system, then the plans and specifications for such private water system and sewer shall be so located as to avoid impairment of them, or contamination from them, during times of flooding.
(3)
Publicly owned water and sewer systems. Water and sewer systems must be constructed in accordance with Chatham County Health Department specifications; sewer systems must connect to an existing publicly owned treatment plant, where practical, and both water and sewer systems and trunk lines shall be conveyed to the city.

(2)
Large trees or other desirable natural growths located in public or private street rights-of-way or public or private easements shall not be removed unless such removal is necessary for the installation of utilities or drainage structures or for other purposes in the public interest and approved by the mayor and council.
(3)
Such removal may be prohibited if the amenity of adjacent property or the amenity of the general neighborhood is adversely affected.
