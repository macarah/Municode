The citizens and businesses of Powder Springs are entitled to have fair, ethical and accountable local government that has earned the public's full confidence for integrity. The City of Powder Spring's strong desire to fulfill this mission therefore requires that:

To this end, the City Council has adopted this code of conduct for elected officials and members of appointed boards, commissions, and committees to assure public confidence in the integrity of local government and its effective and fair operation.

As an expression of the standards of conduct for members expected by the city, this code of conduct is intended to be self-enforcing.

For this reason, standards shall be included in the regular orientations for candidates for City Council, applicants to boards, commissions, and committees and newly elected and appointed officials. Upon adoption of this code, annual thereafter and when sworn in, members entering office shall sign a statement affirming they have read and understood the city code of conduct.

Sec. 2-363. - Compliance and enforcement.
This code of conduct expresses standards of conduct expected for members of City Council, boards, commissions, and committees. Members themselves have the primary responsibility to assure that standards are understood and met, and that the public can continue to have full confidence in the integrity of government. The chairs of boards, commissions, and committees and the mayor have the additional responsibility to intervene when members' actions appearing to be in violation of the code of conduct are brought to their attention. The City Council, by a vote of a majority of its members, may impose sanctions on members whose conduct does not comply with the city's standards, such as reprimand, formal censure, removal from meeting (if the member's conduct is disruptive or impedes the orderly conduct of business at the meeting), or removal from any position or assignment to which the member has been appointed by City Council. The City Council also may act to remove members of boards, commissions, and committees from office.
