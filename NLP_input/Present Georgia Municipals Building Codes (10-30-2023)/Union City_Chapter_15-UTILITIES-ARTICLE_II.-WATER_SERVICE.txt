Sec. 15-18. - Application for water.
(a)
By owner of property. Application for the use of water shall be made to the City of Union City by owner or agent thereof, of the property to be benefited, designating the location of the property and the purpose for which water service is required.
(b)
By non-owner of property. Upon the express, written consent of the property owner, application for the use of water shall be made to the City of Union City by the non-owner of the property whom will occupy the benefited property (tenant, lessee, renter, or any similar person). Said application shall designate the location of the property and state the purpose for which water service is required.
(Code 1976, § 12-103; Ord. No. 2005-13, § 1, 9-20-05; Ord. No. 2005-17, § 1, 11-15-05)
Sec. 15-19. - Separate meters.
(a)
No person shall in any manner or through any fixture or device whatever, use water obtained through the city's water system except through water meters for each and every separate residence or place of business where water is used. However in those cases where residential users have made or make agreements with the city to share meters among two (2) or more residences and have made special arrangements for billings, these agreements will continue to be honored by the city subject to revocation at the will of the city.
(b)
For each office development or office component of a mixed-use development having more than one (1) tenant or unit requiring separate water service, a master water meter may be supplied by the developer or owner of the development to register the quantity of water being supplied to the entire project in lieu of individual meters for each tenant or unit. The developer or owner of the development may, by agreement, provide the city a means of billing each tenant or unit separately; however, the city shall have the authority to discontinue water service to the project if it is unable to discontinue a single tenant or unit's water service when necessary. Whether the developer or owner chooses to use a master water meter or individual water meters, any such meter shall be located on the city right-of-way.
(c)
All billing for water service provided by the city will be based on readings taken from water meters. Generally, residential water customers will have individual meters. If that meter is located on a public right-of-way, the city will read the meter and transmit a bill to the appropriate customer, based on that reading. If the meter is located on a private right-of-way, the developer or owner of the property to which water service is provided by city must cause a master water meter to be installed on a public right-of-way. Upon installation of said master water meter, the city will read the master water meter and transmit a bill to the appropriate party, based on the reading of the master water meter.
(d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no water shall be furnished to any newly constructed building or premises for industrial, retail, or residential use, including the industrial, retail and residential components of a mixed-use development except through individual meters and shall be charged at the established rates. These services are billed by the city to the tenant based on individual unit water meters which will be installed at the time of construction.

(b)
Notice of overdue payment. When bills for water service are not paid when due, water service will be scheduled for disconnection five (5) days subsequent to the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service.
(c)
Water bill disputes. A customer may dispute the amount of any water bill by filing an application in person at city hall for review by the comptroller, or his or her designee. Upon filing of said application, the comptroller, or his or her designee, shall make a determination as to the merit of the dispute and shall inform the customer of the determination within thirty (30) days of receiving the application. A customer may appeal the comptroller's determination to the assistant city manager by filing an application for appeal in person at city hall within five (5) days of the receipt by the customer of said determination. The assistant city manager will consider the appeal and rule accordingly. The decision of the assistant city manager will be the final decision. To the extent the city has adopted a leak protection program, any dispute arising due to a water leak shall be addressed through said program. The dispute process described herein shall not apply to such disputes, even if the customer has opted out of the leak protection program. The mayor and council may adopt additional policies governing the processing of any water bill dispute permitted herein, provided said policies are not in conflict with this section.
(d)
Discontinuing service.
(1)
Individual meters. Where a customer is provided service through an individual water meter as opposed to a master meter or shared meter, the city shall cause the water service of any customer not paying his or her bill five (5) days subsequent to the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service, to be discontinued. Service shall not be resumed until all delinquent bills and additional charges accrued, as provided hereinafter, have been paid in full.
(2)
Master meters or shared meters. In those situations in which two (2) or more residences or tenants are served by a master meter or a shared meter and where the entity responsible for making payment to the city has not paid the bill within five (5) days of the due date printed on the bill for water services, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service to the meter if payment is not made within five (5) days of receipt of the notification. If payment is not made within five (5) days of the entity's receipt of the notification, the city will notify all residences or tenants served by the master meter or shared meter of its intention to discontinue water service. If payment is not made within five (5) days of notification to the residences or tenants, the city shall cause the water service to be discontinued. Service shall not be resumed until all delinquent bills and additional charges accrued, as provided hereinafter, have been paid in full.
(3)
Combination of individual/master or meters. Where water service is provided through a combination of individual and master or shared meters, the procedures used for discontinuing service for nonpayment of the bill for water service shall be determined on a case by case basis.
(4)
Discontinuance of service where bill is in dispute. Regardless of the type of meter used, if the customer has filed an application to dispute his or her water bill with the city administrator, there shall be no disconnection of service pending the city administrator's determination as to the merit of the dispute. If the city administrator determines that the dispute is without merit, the customer's service shall be disconnected if the customer does not appeal the city administrator's determination to the mayor and city council within the time specified in subsection (c) above. If the customer appeals the decision within the specified time, there shall be no disconnection of service pending a hearing before the mayor and city council. However, if such delinquent customer fails to attend a scheduled hearing before the mayor and city council, the utility service shall be terminated as scheduled.
(5)
Service sharges. Every bill not paid by the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service shall be assessed a thirty dollar-service charge.
