A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon investigation or inspection by city employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or such other crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
