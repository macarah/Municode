Provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the city or the clerk to make any photo or machine copies of any papers or documents nor to permit the same to be done where the city does not have equipment available which is operative and capable of making such copies or where the copying of an original paper or document with a machine might, in the opinion of the clerk, damage the original, nor shall the city be required to permit an original paper or document to be taken from the immediate presence of the clerk, deputy clerk or some other person designated by the clerk for such purpose. The clerk may adopt a reasonable form to be used and required its usage to make copies of public records.

Copying fees shall be waived when the requester is acting in capacity of a council or board member and having requested records related to the business of that board, authority, commission, or council for which the requester is a member.
