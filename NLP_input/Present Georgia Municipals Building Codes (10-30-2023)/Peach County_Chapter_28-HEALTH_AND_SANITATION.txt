(3)
The minimum number of portable sanitation units required during anticipated peak attendance at a special event shall be determined in accordance with Table 2, after taking into consideration any sewered seated or urinal toilets that may be present at the site of the special event.
(h)
Portable sanitation units shall be located as close as practical to the highest concentration of participants, observers and employees of special events. However, the units should be placed as far from the food service area as possible. The safety of users shall be a primary consideration in the placement of the units. At special events, portable sanitation units shall be accessible at all times for maintenance by truck.
(i)
No strong bases, acids or organic solvents shall be used in the operation of a portable sanitation unit. Chemicals used in the cleaning, operation or maintenance of portable sanitation units shall be in accordance with applicable federal, state and local provisions.
