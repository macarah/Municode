ARTICLE II. - COMMERCIAL WASTE HANDLING (FATS, OILS AND GREASE)

2-16-21 - Purpose.
(a)
Excessive amounts of fats, oils, grease, grit, sand and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation and vehicle maintenance facilities. This ordinance sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial waste sludge and byproducts.
(b)
The objective of this ordinance is:
(1)
To minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system; and
(2)
To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with Chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the Rules and Regulations of the EPD.
2-16-22 - Coverage and Exclusions.
(a)
This ordinance applies to any facility that generates commercial wastes, to any person who removes commercial wastes, to any person who processes commercial wastes, and to any person who accepts commercial waste for final disposal.
(b)
This ordinance applies only within the geographical and political boundaries of the unincorporated area of Glynn County, Georgia. However, any transporter or disposal site operator within Glynn County, who receives commercial wastes (whether such wastes originate within or outside the County or State), must still comply with the registration, permitting, and manifest requirements.
2-16-23 - Requirements.
(a)
General.
(1)
It is the responsibility of the originator to assure that the commercial waste removed from the originator's facility is properly treated and discharged to the sewer system, wastewater, sludge and byproducts are transported by a permitted transporter, and disposed of at an EPD approved commercial waste processing and disposal facility.
(2)
The originator of commercial waste shall not allow a transporter to remove waste from their facility without a current commercial waste transporter issued by the Utility.
(b)
Permitting Process.
(1)
There is only one type of permit required under this ordinance, which is a Commercial Waste Transporter Permit.
(2)
The permit for the transporter is issued by the Utility under this ordinance. However, prior to obtaining a Commercial Waste Transporter Permit, the transporter must first register as a transporter of commercial waste with the EPD and obtain a transporter registration number. This registration number must be included in the permit number issued by the Utility.
2-16-24 - Manifests.
All originators, transporters, processing and disposal site operators, involved in the removal, transport, and disposal of commercial wastes and commercial waste sludge and byproducts, shall participate in proper maintenance of manifests. This manifest will require signatures from the originator, transporter and disposer in order to maintain and establish accountability. The approved manifest is a multi-copy form. A sample copy of an Approved Manifest is on file with the Utility.
(a)
The Originator Shall:
(1)
Sign the received manifest form, maintain such record on site for a period of three years, making it available for inspection by the Utility.
(2)
Upon receipt of the completed copy of the manifest from the transporter, the originator must provide a copy of the manifest within ten working days to the Utility. A manifest is considered complete after the commercial waste is delivered and disposed of at the commercial waste disposal or processing facility and the manifest has been signed and completed by the disposal or processing facility.
(3)
Report any spills to the Utility upon becoming aware of a spill that could impact any surrounding areas such as storm drains, adjacent streams or ground surface where the transporter has removed waste from the facility's pretreatment system. Failure to notify the Utility of a spill will constitute a violation of this ordinance and fines may be assessed to the commercial waste originator as well as the transporter.
(b)
The Transporter Shall:
(1)
Utilize a manifest for each location being serviced.
(2)
Sign the transporter portion of the manifest and leave a copy of the manifest with the originator.
(3)
Present the manifest to the disposal operator to complete and sign the disposal section, and shall leave one copy of the manifest with the disposal site operator.
(4)
Send a completed copy of the manifest to the originator with the signature of the disposal site operator within 30 days.
(5)
Keep one copy of the completed manifest form demonstrating delivery to the disposal site operator for their records and shall maintain such records for a period of three years; except that the transporter's manifest (or copy thereof) covering not less than the immediately preceding 30-day period for a particular tank truck shall be kept in the transporter's tank truck. All such records shall be available for inspection.
(6)
Ensure that the manifest contains all the information required on the manifest form prescribed and furnished from time to time by the EPD.
(7)
A transporter must remove the entire contents of any commercial tank that is serviced and dispose of such contents, unmingled with hazardous wastes or septic wastes, and only at a facility authorized to receive such waste.
(8)
A transporter shall provide a copy of the commercial waste transporter permit for the tank truck to each disposal site where the transporter disposes of commercial wastes.
(c)
Processing or Disposal. A processing or disposal facility of commercial waste shall maintain copies of all manifests of tank pumping at their principal place of business for a period of three years and make such records available for inspection.
