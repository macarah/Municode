(Ord. of 7-20-2009, § I)
Sec. 2-72. - Decorum of debate.
The following practices shall be followed in the discussions (debate) on motions and matters presented to the board of commissioners:
(1)
Adherence to agenda.
a.
In discussion, the remarks made by the commissioners shall be confined to the motion or matters immediately before the body.
b.
Concerning the opportunity for commissioners to address the public at regular meetings:
1.
Each commissioner shall have an opportunity to address the public on any topic.
2.
During these remarks, a commissioner must observe the same rules of decorum as those in subsection (2) of this section and may be called to order by the chairman if there is a breach of those applicable rules.
3.
A commissioner may not use this time to interrogate another commissioner, staff or citizens. No one shall attempt to enter into discussion with a commissioner who has chosen to avail himself of this opportunity to share his opinions with the public.
(2)
Discussion of the item of business. In discussion, a commissioner may condemn the nature or likely consequences of the proposed measure in strong terms, but must avoid personalities, and under no circumstances may he attack or question the motives of another commissioner or staff. The item, and not a person, shall be the item under discussion.
(3)
Call to order; remarks. The chair shall immediately call as out of order any remarks made in regards to comments outside the issue being addressed; or another commissioner may call this breach of procedure to the attention of the chair and other commissioners. In either case, the errant commissioner shall immediately cease the breach of decorum and continue with his remarks confined to the topic.
(4)
Discussion through the chair. All discussion shall be made through the chair, and one commissioner may not interrogate another commissioner or person speaking from the public except through the chair (or with the permission of the chair).
(5)
Equal opportunity. After a commissioner has spoken or asked questions on a matter before the commission, other commissioners shall be given the opportunity to speak. If no other commissioner wishes to speak to the issue, the commissioner may continue speaking to the issue.
(6)
Common disruptions. During discussion or voting, a commissioner shall not disturb the other commissioners in any way that may be considered disruptive to the proceedings or hamper the transaction of business.
(7)
Call to order; action. The chair may rule as out of order any action deemed inappropriate or dilatory and may interrupt a speaker for reasons deemed necessary by the chair. The chairman shall say, "Commissioner, those remarks are out of order. Please cease this line of comments and restrict your comments to the inquiry and the merits of the agenda item."
(8)
Out of order. If a member of the commission refuses to comply with these rules as adopted by the commission, the following procedure shall be used:
a.
The commissioner shall be called to order by the chair, who shall say, "Commissioner ___________ (using name), you are now personally out of order. If you persist, an official reprimand (or censure) will be entered into the record."
b.
If a commissioner chooses to defy the ruling of the chair, the chairman shall state, "Commissioner, you are personally out of order. Madam/Mr. Clerk, let the record indicate a reprimand against Commissioner ___________. Commissioner ___________, you have a right at this time to appeal the ruling of the chair by asking that a roll call vote of the commissioners present be taken and a statement by each commissioner be recorded as to why he is for or against the ruling of the chair. A majority vote of the board present shall govern."
(Ord. of 7-20-2009, § II)
Sec. 2-73. - Procedure in meetings.
(a)
Motions. Prior to taking the vote, the chair should state the motion (or resolution) or its substance.

e.
Limit discussion or debate by the commission;
f.

g.
Refer back to staff/committee; or refer to staff/committee;
h.
Amend;
i.
Main motion.
(2)
A main motion shall be a motion whose introduction brings business before the commission.
a.
Assumed main motions. A recommendation from staff, or another item published in the agenda for action, shall be handled as an assumed main motion by the chair. That is, the chair shall, upon the conclusion of a report, state, "The question (or motion) before you is …" (stating the motion in the affirmative). No second will be required in these instances and the chair, in assuming such motion, is not presumed to be in favor of the motion and may speak against it if he so wishes.
1.
Possible dispositions of such a motion assumed by the chair include:
(i)
Adopt;
(ii)
Amend and adopt with amendments (or stipulations);
(iii)
Defeat;
(iv)
Refer back to staff/committee; or refer to staff/committee;

Incidental motions such as consider en gross, consider by paragraph, or divide the motion (each described in subsection (d) of this section) may also be applied to such assumed motions.
b.
Other main motions (motions that are incidental or relating to business of the commission, or its past or future action, or arising as non-agenda items (see section 2-71(i))) shall require a second, and, if such motions fail to obtain a second, the chairman shall state, "Since there is no second, the motion is not before this meeting."
(3)
Concerning the amending of particular motions:
a.
If a commissioner feels that the main motion might be more acceptable in a way other than the way presented, the commissioner may amend through substitution, insertion of stipulations, striking out portions, or striking out and inserting portions. Such proposed amendments shall be handled in one of the following ways:
1.
By unanimous consent of the commissioners; the chair, or another commissioner, through the chair, may suggest changes or stipulations, and if there are no objections from the commissioners, the motion shall be amended by unanimous consent.
2.
With a second, discussion and a majority vote on the proposed amendment.
b.
If a proposed amendment fails to obtain unanimous consent or a majority vote, the main motion considered shall be the one originally presented.
c.
An amendment must be germane (relating to the substance of the main motion) and may not introduce an independent question.
d.
Improper amendments shall be:
1.
One which is not germane;
2.
One which would make the adoption of the amended motion equivalent to a rejection of the motion;
3.
One which is frivolous or absurd.
(4)
If the commissioners feel that adequate information has not been given, the board may, by majority vote, refer the motion to staff (or an agency, committee, etc.) for more information. A date may be set for hearing the additional information or it may be open-ended. This motion shall require a second and shall be debatable only as to whether or not it shall be referred to whom it shall be referred, or when the person to whom it is referred shall report back. If the motion fails, the motion to be considered shall be that motion which was on the floor prior to the motion to refer.
(5)
A motion to hold to a time certain (postpone) may be used if a majority of the commission feels that the motion before them should be considered at a more convenient time or if the discussion shows that a final decision should be made at a later time or date. This motion shall be used if the commissioners themselves feel that they may obtain information that is needed or that the facts as presented are not adequate for their final vote. A second shall be required and discussion shall be limited to the reason for holding the motion or the time to which it is to be held. If the motion fails, the motion to be considered shall be that motion which was on the floor prior to the motion to hold.
(6)
If a commissioner feels that a set period of time for discussion of a motion should be limited as to time for the motion as a whole, or as to individual time given, the commissioner may move to "limit discussion (or debate) to _____ minutes." This motion shall require a second and no discussion on the motion shall be allowed. It shall require a four-fifths vote to adopt. Should only four members of the commission be present, a unanimous vote shall be required.
(7)
A commissioner may call the question (a motion to end discussion) when it is clear that further discussion is unnecessary or that discussion is becoming repetitive. This motion shall require a second and no discussion on the motion shall be allowed. It shall require a four-fifths vote to adopt. Should only four members of the commission be present, a unanimous vote shall be required.
(8)
If any matters occur such as to impede a commissioner in attending to the business, e.g., too much noise, the microphone not working, matters that affect the safety, orderliness, or comfort of the commissioners, or affect the honor of an individual commissioner, such commissioner may state to the chairman that he has a question of privilege and the matter must be addressed before the pending business of the commission continues. No vote is required unless a motion arises out of the privilege.
(9)
A recess may be taken as it appears on the agenda or declared by the chair when he deems it advisable or by a motion from a commissioner. If the motion is made by a commissioner, a second and an affirmative majority vote shall be required to recess.
(10)
The highest-ranking motion shall be the motion to adjourn, requiring a second and a majority vote with no discussion allowed, except that the motion shall contain a time to hear any noncompleted items on the agenda, if such exist. If all business on the agenda has been completed, the chair may assume the motion and, without a second, obtain unanimous consent to adjourn.
(c)
Motions used to bring back an issue. Except as otherwise provided by law, if a commissioner wishes to bring back to the board a matter which has been adopted, he may do so through the motions to reconsider, rescind and amend something previously adopted. These shall have the same rank as a main motion.
(1)
If a commissioner wishes to amend an action taken at a previous meeting, the motion to amend something previously adopted shall be followed. This motion shall be used when a matter which was previously adopted by the commission needs to be amended. A second shall be required and full discussion shall be allowed. If the item has been listed on the published agenda, a majority vote shall be required for adoption. A majority vote shall be required if the item is not on the official agenda, except that, should only four members of the commission be present, a unanimous vote shall be required.
(2)
If in the same meeting, new information or changed situations make it appear that a different result might reflect the will of the board, any commissioner (regardless of how he originally voted on the matter) may move to reconsider the vote. A motion to reconsider may be applied to a vote that was either affirmative or negative and shall propose no specific change in a decision but simply shall propose that the motion be reopened for discussion and another vote taken. A second shall be required to this motion and discussion shall be allowed as to the reasons for wishing to reconsider the vote. A majority vote shall be required to adopt the motion to reconsider.
(3)
If a commissioner wishes to annul an action taken at a previous meeting, the motion to rescind may be used. The motion to rescind shall require prior notice at a regularly scheduled meeting of the intent to rescind a motion at the next scheduled meeting. The motion to rescind shall not be in order if:
a.
The motion to reconsider is made, i.e., at the same meeting;
b.
The motion to reconsider was taken and lost;
c.
The matter is routine and only part of the action needs to be changed, in which case the motion to amend something previously adopted shall be used;
d.
Something has been done as a result of the vote to implement the earlier action adopted.
The motion to rescind shall be placed on the agenda for the following meeting, a second shall be required, and discussion may go into the merits of the motion involved in rescinding. A majority shall be required to pass the motion after such prior notice.
(d)
Incidental motions. Incidental motions have no rank but shall be decided immediately before business may proceed and may be used throughout the meeting as follows:
(1)
A point of information is a request, directed to or through the chair, for information relevant to the business at hand, but not related to parliamentary procedure.
(2)
A commissioner may call for a point of order if he believes that the chair has failed to notice a breach in the rules. This point of order shall require the chair to make a ruling on the question involved.
(3)
Whenever a commissioner believes that the chair is mistaken in his ruling, a commissioner may appeal the chair's decision. An appeal shall require a second and shall be debatable with the chair speaking first to explain his ruling. The chair may also close out the debate with a statement defending the ruling. An appeal may be made only on a ruling and may not be made:
a.
In response to a parliamentary inquiry or point of information;
b.
In areas that challenge verifiable rulings of factual nature.
The chair shall state the motion as "Shall the chair's decision be sustained?" A tie vote shall sustain the chair because a majority of those voting shall be required to overturn the chair's ruling.
(4)
A parliamentary inquiry is a question directed to the chair to obtain information on a matter of parliamentary law or the rules of the commission. The chair will answer such questions or may ask the county attorney or parliamentarian for an opinion. The chair's reply, whether or not he has requested advice from the county attorney or parliamentarian, is an opinion, not a ruling. If a commissioner does not agree with the chair's opinion, he may act in a way contrary to this opinion and if ruled out of order may then appeal the chair's ruling. The chair is not obligated to respond to hypothetical questions.
(5)
If the motion presented contains two or more parts capable of standing as separate motions, a commissioner may move to divide the motion. This motion shall require a second and discussion shall be allowed only on why it should or should not be divided. A majority vote shall be required to adopt the motion to divide the motion.
(6)
If a main motion is in the form of a resolution or document containing several paragraphs or sections which are not separate motions but could be discussed more efficiently if discussed in sections, a motion to discuss by paragraphs, sections, or numbered agenda items under a tab may be made. A second shall be required and discussion shall be brief as to the necessity for the action. A majority vote shall be required to consider by paragraphs, sections, or numbered agenda items under a tab.
(7)
Once a motion has been moved and seconded, it belongs to the entire commission and not to the maker of the motion; therefore, if a commissioner wishes to withdraw a motion that is officially before the board, action of the board must be taken in either of the following ways:
a.
The chair may ask the board if there are any objections to the motion being withdrawn. If there are no objections, the motion shall be withdrawn by unanimous consent, without the need for the seconder to withdraw his second;
b.
If there is an objection to the motion being withdrawn, then the chair shall take an official vote, a second being required. A majority vote shall be required to adopt the motion to withdraw the motion.
(8)
When several alternatives need to be considered (such as staff recommendations that propose various options for the board to consider), unlimited choices may be considered by filling the blank in the motion:
a.
No commissioner may suggest more than one proposal for filling the blank without unanimous consent from the other commissioners;
b.
Each proposal shall be debatable and shall be treated as an independent item to be voted on separately until one has been approved by a majority. As soon as one proposal has received a majority, no others shall be considered;
c.
Alternatives (from staff recommendations and/or suggestions by commissioners) are listed in logical order for voting:
1.
Names are listed in the order in which they were proposed;
2.
Other proposals are listed in the order of their probable acceptability, beginning with the least popular choice.
(Ord. of 7-20-2009, § III)
Sec. 2-74. - Parliamentarian.

(Ord. of 7-20-2009, § V)
Sec. 2-76. - Suspending the rules of order/amendments.
(a)
The board reserves the right to waive any or all of these procedures and rules of order upon its own motion; however, any such motion shall require the unanimous consent of the board.
(b)
These rules may be amended by a majority vote of the entire commission at a regular meeting or special meeting of the board of commissioners, provided notice has been given of the amendment at the meeting prior to the vote on the amendment.

(a)
Purchases of less than $5,000.00 may be authorized by the department head of the using agency. The using agency must determine that the price is fair and reasonable. One method of this is to obtain and document a minimum of three phone quotes prior to initiating a purchase. The using agency is responsible for ensuring the vendor is established in the accounts payable system.

(e)
Emergency purchases shall be authorized by the county manager whenever a condition exists that presents a threat to the safety, health, and welfare of the citizens of the county and when it is determined that following the normal procurement process would cause undue delay in the delivery of essential services under the emergency conditions.
(f)
Sole-source vendor. The county manager shall approve the purchase of any item that is available from only one vendor and is considered a sole-source vendor purchase. This approval should be obtained before the requirement is sent to the purchasing manager for processing.

(Ord. No. 17-004 , § 5, 2-20-2017)
Sec. 2-156. - Procurement procedures.
(a)
Verbal quotes on purchases below $5,000.00. Quotes for purchases may be obtained by contacting the vendors who are capable of supplying the product or services required and asking them for a quote over the phone. The person obtaining the quote should record the date, vendor's name, contact's name, and the price for the product or service.
(b)
Written quotes on purchases $5,000.00 to 30,000.00. Quotes for purchases may be obtained by contacting the vendors who are capable of supplying the product or services required and asking them to send a written quote by mail, fax, or email. The quote should contain the date of the quote, the vendor's name, contact's name and phone number, and the price for the product or service.
(c)
Sealed bids on purchases over $30,000.00. Under the sealed bid method, the county issues an invitation to bid (ITB) that explains the requirements of the supplies or materials being required or the project specifications. The bid or contract that is awarded must be to the lowest responsible bidder who meets all the requirements of the ITB. Bids are valid for only 60 days unless otherwise agreed by the county and the bidder. Under the sealed bid method, the county may negotiate only with the lowest responsible bidder if all responsive bids exceed the county's budget for the supplies, material or project.
(d)
Sealed proposals on purchases over $30,000.00. The proposal method allows the county to select the offer based on evaluation factors established in the request for proposals (RFP). In the RFP, the county must list all of the factors that will be used to evaluate each offering to select the best proposal. The RFP must also assign a relative weight to each factor. Each responsive proposal is scored according to only those factor listed in the proposals. Once all the proposals are scored, the relative weight of each factor is applied, and the firm with the best score wins or the county may "short list" the top three firms that the county feels are capable of meeting all the requirements of the RFP for future negotiations. The scoring sheets must be used to evaluate firms and are subject to open records requirements once the project is awarded. Because price does not have to be an evaluation factor, the county is not restricted in hiring the firm that offers the lowest price. If the contract is awarded, it must be to the firm determined in writing to be most advantageous to the county based upon the factors specified in the RFP. Proposals are valid as long as specified in the RFP, but vendors/contractors not on the short list must be released after 60 days. If specified in the RFP, the county may negotiate with those firms on the short list for purposes of obtaining a best and final offer under the proposal method.
(e)
Federal and state funding. Should the procurement of goods and/or services be funded in whole or partially utilizing federal or state funds, then all federal and/or state procurement regulations must be followed to ensure proper reimbursement of these funds to the county. The finance director and purchasing manager will coordinate efforts to ensure the county adheres to these regulations.
(f)
Bid bonds, performance bonds, or deposits. The manager shall be authorized to require a bid bond, performance bond, or deposit, payable to the county for contracts up to $100,000.00 from vendors bidding on any goods or services when, and in such amounts, the nature of the goods or services warrant such a bond or deposit, or whenever such bond or deposit is required under state law. Notice of bond or deposit shall be included in the public notice and ITB/RFP specifications. Contracts over $100,000.00 shall require a bid bond, performance bond, or deposit. Such bond or deposit shall not exceed 100 percent of the bid amount.
(g)
Addenda modifying plans and specifications. Addenda modifying plans and specifications shall not be issued within a period of three days of the advertised time for the bid or proposal to close, excluding weekends and legal holidays. If it becomes necessary to issue an addendum modifying plans and specifications within the three days immediately preceding the advertised time for the bid or proposal to close, the be closing date and time will be extended by exactly one week without the requirement to re-advertise. Any addenda issued to modify plans and specification must be acknowledged by every vendor submitting a bid or proposal using the form provided with the bid or proposal. Failure to acknowledge all addenda issued will result in the bid or proposal being rejected.
(h)
Local vendor preference. Except for matters required to be bid by state law, such as public works contracts and materials, any purchase or contract under $100,000.00 that is put out to bid under this division may be handled in the following manner. When a non-local business submits the lowest bid price and the bid submitted by one or more local business is within five percent of the price submitted by the non-local business, the local business with the lowest submitted bid shall have the opportunity to match the low bid of the non-local business. If they match the low bid, they will be awarded the contract. If this local business does not desire to match the low bid, then the local business with the next lowest bid within the five percent price range will be asked until all local businesses within the five percent range have had the opportunity to match the low bid. If a local business does not desire to match the non-local business' bid, the non-local business will be awarded the bid/contract.
(i)
Single responses. When only one response is received on a solicitation, the county will review the response to determine if all specifications have been met, that the response is a responsive and responsible bid, and that the response is within the budget for the solicitation. If these conditions are met by the vendor, then the county may accept the response and award to the responding vendor. However, if the response does not meet all three of these conditions, the county will withdraw the solicitation and will determine the actions that must be accomplished to release a new solicitation to attempt to obtain competitive responses.
(j)
Unopened responses. If a response is rejected without being opened because the information on the response does not match the requirements of the solicitation or the response is received after the announced closing time, the response will be returned to the vendor as having been rejected for noncompliance.
(k)
Rejected responses. Responses may be rejected for any of the following reasons by the purchasing manager, the finance director, the county manager and/or the board of commissioners. Once a response is rejected at any level of review, the response cannot be considered for the award.
The response to the solicitation was received after the announced closing date and time of the solicitation.
The response fails to comply with any provisions or specifications outlined in the solicitation.
The response includes an escalation clause that was not authorized by the specifications of the solicitation.
The response includes alternate bids but the solicitation did not authorize the acceptance of alternate bids.
The response, when opened, contained multiple responses to the solicitation. A vendor may submit multiple responses but each response must be submitted separately, as outlined in the solicitation, to be considered.
The vendor discusses the solicitation with the county personnel or elected officials who are not authorized to answer questions or to be contacted as outlined in the bid documents and/or request for proposals from the time the solicitation is released until the time the board of commissioners approves the award of the bid or the contract.
The county manager or the board of commissioners may deem it necessary and in the best interest of the county to reject all responses because of funding constraints, new specifications that become evident during the review process but were not provided to the vendors, lack of responsiveness on all responses received, or other justification that comes to light after the closing date and time and before the award of the bid or contract.
(l)
Tie bids. If two or more bids received in conjunction with a valid ITB are received for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the bid will be awarded to a local business. When a local business is not one of the vendors with the tied bid, the board of commissioners shall award the contract at their discretion.
(m)
Protests. After the board of commissioners has awarded a bid or contact, any vendor who submitted a valid response to the solicitation and feels they have a legal challenge to the award, must file a written letter of protest outlining their reason for challenging the award within three days of the award of the bid. Should the vendor failure to present the protest in three days, excluding weekends and legal holidays, the vendor forfeits their right to protest the results of the board's decision and the vendor must then seek an injunction through the courts to challenge the process.
(n)
Payments on bids and contracts. Payment(s) to vendors who have successfully responded to a solicitation and have been awarded a bid or contract by the board of commissioners shall be made after all material and services have been received and the board of commissioners or their representative have accepted the material or services as compliant with the specifications of the solicitation. The acceptance of goods and services should be provided by a signed delivery ticket, bill of laden, or letter of acceptance. The vendor will submit an invoice with a copy of the acceptance paperwork to the finance department for processing of payment under the terms of net 30 from the date of the invoice. Exceptions to the net 30 payment can only be made by the finance director or the county manager.
Partial payments are allowed on purchase orders based upon delivery and acceptance of material and/or services as outlined in the above paragraph. The vendor will submit an invoice with a copy of the acceptance paperwork to the finance department for processing of payment under the terms of net 30 from the date of the invoice. Exceptions to the net 30 payment can only be made by the finance director or the county manager.
Payments on public works projects will be subject to a retainage of ten percent of the total amount paid out to date. The vendor may request payment of the retainage after the architect has signed off on the project as complete, the board or the board's representative has signed off on the project as complete, the representative of the federal government or state government signs off on the project as complete in the case where funding from these organizations in involved, the contractor has provided a waiver of liens, and the entire punch list of items requiring attention, correction, or repair have been resolved.
(o)
Conflict of interest. No county elected official or county employee shall have a direct interest or indirect interest in any business wishing to engage in an agreement with the county for the purchase of goods or services.
(p)
Equal opportunity. The county will provide equal opportunity for all businesses to participate in county contracts regardless of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicap status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. The county will actively seek to ensure that minority-owned and operated firms have the opportunity to participate in the purchasing process, including binding, negotiations, and contract awards. The county will not knowingly conduct business with contractors that discriminate or permit discrimination against persons for any reason.
(q)
Ineligible vendors. Any person, firm, or corporation in arrears to the county for taxes, or otherwise, will not be eligible to bid on any county solicitation until their lien to the county has been cleared. Any person, firm, or corporation barred from participating in solicitations at the federal or state levels of government will also be barred from participating in county solicitations. Any vendor knowingly violating the county purchasing ordinance to gain an advantage in the solicitation process shall be barred by the purchasing manager from participating in future solicitations for a period of three years.
(Ord. No. 17-004 , § 6, 2-20-2017)
Sec. 2-157. - Purchases with a purchasing card.
(a)
The purchasing card (P-card) is a credit card issued by the approved vendor awarded the state contract for providing P-card services. It is a fast and flexible purchasing tool that provides an extremely efficient and effective method of purchasing and paying for necessary goods and services. Purchases can be completed over the phone, in person, or over the internet utilizing the P-card.
The P-card will be issued in the name of the employee with the county BOC and the county seal clearly present on the card. Employees who are issued a P-card will sign a policy statement that they understand the proper use of the P-card and will adhere to the policies set forth in the BOC P-card resolution when utilizing the P-card. Additionally, the guidelines for purchases outlined in section 2-156 above must be followed when P-card purchases are being transacted.
(b)
The purchasing manager will be assigned the responsibility to monitor and manage the county's P-card system. Should a transaction warrant additional explanation, the purchasing manager may contact the P-card user for additional information that can be documented in the P-card transaction record to record this information for audit purposes. Department heads will be responsible for reviewing and signing off on all P-card transactions transacted by any employee in their department who has been authorized a P-card. The purchasing manager, in coordination with the county manager, may suspend and/or cancel a P-card when activity on the card may be suspicious.
(c)
At the end of the month when the billing statement is received from the bank, the purchasing manager will reconcile the statement to the transactions in on-line monitoring program and will produce the import file that will be processed into the finance software to ensure payment of the statement in accordance with the terms of the P-card agreement.

The term "county official" also includes all individuals, including county employees, appointed by the chairman and/or county commission as appropriate to county authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the chairman and/or county commission.
