Sections:

4.02.010 - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
"Burial space or grave" is a location where a dead body (typically that of a human, although sometimes that of an animal) is buried. See Cemetery Lot or Plot.
"Cemetery plot" means and consists of enough land in which a deceased person may be buried in single spaces, as defined in the plat of the cemetery and as described in the deed of the burial rights to the owner thereof. Also knows as a cemetery lot, grave, or burial space. The parts of a cemetery plot usually consist of the following:
"Grave cut." The excavation that formed the grave. This can vary from a shallow scraping, to removal of topsoil to a depth of six feet, or more where a vault is to be constructed.
"Excavated spoil." The material dug up when the grave is excavated. Often piled up close to the grave for backfilling and then returned to the grave to cover it.
"Burial vault." A vault is a structure built within the grave to receive the body as part of the interment. It may be used to prevent crushing of the remains. Sometimes a crypt is used and is typically an above-ground or sometimes an in-ground burial chamber often where the body of the deceased is placed.
"Interment or burial." The process of placing a deceased person in the cemetery plot, with or without personal possessions of the deceased.
"Grave backfill." The soil returned to the grave cut following burial. The fill may be left level with the ground or mounded.
"Monument or marker." Headstones are best known but they can be supplemented by decorative edging, foot stones, posts to support items, a solid covering or other options.
"Disinterment." The process by which a deceased person is removed from a cemetery plot as prescribed herein.
"Square" means the unit area of land consisting of fourteen feet by twenty feet within the cemetery that contains a minimum of six contiguous cemetery plots,
