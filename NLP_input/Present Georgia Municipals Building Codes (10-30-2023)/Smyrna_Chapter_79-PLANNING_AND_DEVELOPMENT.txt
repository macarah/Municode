ARTICLE III. - WAIVER OF DEVELOPMENT FEES

Sec. 79-32. - General.
In order to waive development costs associated with distressed residential developments under article II of chapter 79 of the City's Code of Ordinances (Economic Incentive Program), the following conditions outlined in section 79-33 must exist. Development costs in this context are defined as building permit fees, plan checking fees, sewer tap fees, water meter fees, garbage container fees and records fees.
( Ord. No. 2013-05 , 3-18-13)
Sec. 79-33. - Eligibility for incentives.
At a minimum, a residential development shall meet the following criteria:
(1)
The proposed units are designed and intended to be owner occupied structures. With this in mind, no incentive requests will be considered for apartment developments.
(2)
The proposed development must be on property that previously received a land disturbance permit or a building permit prior to January 1, 2009, and which became void due to inactivity (the purpose of this requirement is to encourage distressed properties to begin development again but not apply to newer developments that were started after the economic downturn as it is assumed that the market has already been reset for those properties).
(3)
A waiver of the total development costs, up to 50 percent, may be granted.
(4)
If a certificate of occupancy is issued for the final unit of the project within 24 months from the date when the first building permit is issued, the project may receive a rebate of an additional 10 percent of the overall development fees which would have been applicable prior to any waiver.
(5)
A wavier of fees shall not be retroactively applied to projects that are currently under development or have an active land disturbance permit or building permit for the site.
If these conditions exist, the mayor and council have the right, but not the obligation, to consider and approve, deny or modify such a request in a public meeting. In order to consider the validity of such a request, a letter from the developer addressed to the community development director must be submitted outlining both the breakdown of their request by each element involved in their development costs as well as the corresponding rationale for requesting such.
