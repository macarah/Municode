ARTICLE IV. - FLINT RIVER PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 18-101. - Purpose.
(a)
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(b)
The Flint River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Flint River as defined herein.
(Ord. of 9-10-2001(1), § 1)
Sec. 18-102. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the state Hazardous Waste Management Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq.))
Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
Natural vegetative buffer and buffer area mean a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in the state Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
Port facility means any facility for the docking, loading, and unloading of ships.
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400-cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.) are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limits of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.).
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. 12-5-440 et seq.), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. 12-5-280 et seq.), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.
Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
(1)
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
(2)
Rare or exemplary natural communities;
(3)
Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
(4)
Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources, and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.

ARTICLE V. - WETLANDS PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 18-191. - Purpose.
(a)
The wetlands in the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(c)
The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

Sec. 18-192. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for the county.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344).
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344), as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 9-10-2001(3), § 3)
Sec. 18-222. - Protection criteria; requirement for local permit or permission.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the building inspector using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit (section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344) or letter of permission is issued.
(Ord. of 9-10-2001(3), § 4)
Sec. 18-223. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations (section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344) provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit (section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344). However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (33 USC 403), a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the Unites States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit (section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344).
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344).
(4)
