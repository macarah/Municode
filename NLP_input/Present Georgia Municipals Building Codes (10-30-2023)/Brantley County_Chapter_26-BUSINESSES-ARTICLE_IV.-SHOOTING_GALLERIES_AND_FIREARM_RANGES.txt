State Law reference— Discharge of firearm near public highway or street, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-103; discharge of firearm on property of another, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-104; Georgia Firearms and Weapons Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-120 et seq.

Sec. 26-131. - Findings.
(a)
The board of commissioners, based on common knowledge, investigation, and experience derived from other local government jurisdictions, believes that shooting galleries and firearm range establishments as defined in this article, if unregulated, would likely have an adverse impact upon adjacent property and the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the county.
(b)
The county's law enforcement resources available for responding to problems generally associated with unregulated shooting galleries and firearm ranges are limited and are best conserved by regulating such operations.
(c)
The protection of the public's health, safety, welfare and property interest require that shooting galleries and/or firearm range establishments, their locations and operations be regulated in order to reduce the potential for harm, and preserve the quality of life in residential and business areas of the community.
(d)
It is the duty of the board of commissioners to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, its residents, and the character of its neighborhoods and developments.
(e)
The laws of the state authorize a county governing authority to adopt rules and regulations for the protection of the health, safety, welfare and property of its citizens, and O.C.G.A. § 48-13-9 authorizes a local government to require a regulated business to pay a regulatory fee.
(Ord. of 8-17-1999)
Sec. 26-132. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses to the end that the adverse effect on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed, and to impose a regulatory fee on such regulated businesses. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests for the protection of people and property through the regulation of shooting galleries and firearm ranges versus any legally protected rights of such operations and its patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
