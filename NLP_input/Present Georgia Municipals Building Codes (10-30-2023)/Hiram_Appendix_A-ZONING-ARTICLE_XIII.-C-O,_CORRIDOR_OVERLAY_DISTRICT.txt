ARTICLE XIII. - C-O, CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. A. - Purpose, intent and authority.
(1)
Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within certain designated transportation corridors.
The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the Corridor Overlay District.
(a)
All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area.
(b)
The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments.
(c)
Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted.
(d)
Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
(e)
Any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings.
(f)
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.
(2)
Statement of Intent. These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the selected transportation corridors.
The creation of the Corridor Overlay District will promote developments that will allow the City of Hiram, Georgia, to grow in positive and sustainable patterns. These standards include regulatory control and design of building development and materials, parking areas, signage, transportation (pedestrian and vehicular), green-space and trees/vegetation.
(3)
Authority. Authority underlying creation of the Corridor Overlay Zoning District is provided for in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, Section 36-66-2, the Charter of the City of Hiram, Georgia, and/or the Code of Ordinances, of the City of Hiram, Georgia.
(4)
Statement of Significance.
(a)
State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) traverses the City of Hiram, Georgia, from the east, beginning 0.11 miles Southwest from Stephens Mill Drive, and ending 0.08 miles Northeast from Bobo Road. State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) is a divided, four-lane with median from the Cobb County line to its intersection and convergence with U. S. Highway 278. Marietta Highway is considered by the County Comprehensive Plan and associated Future Land Use Map, of Paulding County, Georgia, to be one of the County's primary commercial corridors. Future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of the City of Hiram, Georgia.
(b)
Bill Carruth Parkway f/k/a West Hiram Parkway is located in the eastern portion of the City of Hiram, Georgia, along U. S. 278/GA 6. The City of Hiram, Georgia's, portion of the roadway begins at the intersection of Marietta Highway with U. S. Highway 278 and extends southward 0.08 miles. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. Bill Carruth Parkway is expected to continue to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(c)
In addition thereto, State Route 92 traverse the City of Hiram, Georgia, beginning north of U. S. 278/GA 6 0.35 miles, running south ending at the intersection of Nebo Road. State Route 92 is heavily traveled and has varied new developments. The introduction of the Corridor Overlay District will encourage the development in this area to project a uniform, high-quality appearance.
(d)
US Highway 278 is the most heavily traveled roadway in Paulding County, and is one of only two four-lane highways in the Paulding County, Georgia. It traverses the City of Hiram, Georgia, from the shared boarder of Powder Springs, Georgia, in Cobb County, Georgia, to the intersection of Palisades Parkway. US 278 travels through the City of Hiram, Georgia's, commercial center. As US 278 is considered by the Comprehensive Plan and associated Future Land Use Map, of Paulding County, Georgia, to be one of Paulding County, Georgia's, primary commercial corridors, future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of the City of Hiram, Georgia.
(e)
The East Hiram Parkway is a highway corridor which begins at the terminus of the Bill Carruth Parkway and continues through the eastern portion of Paulding County, Georgia, ending at the intersection of U. S. 278/GA 6, in the City of Hiram, Georgia. The portion of the roadway that lies in the jurisdiction of the City of Hiram, Georgia, begins at the intersection of U. S. 278/GA 6, running south ending 0.10 mile from U. S. 278/GA 6. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. East Hiram Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(f)
In addition thereto, all State Routes in the City of Hiram, Georgia, are designated as commercial areas in the Future Land Use Map and Comprehensive Plan, of Paulding County, Georgia. The City of Hiram, Georgia, does not have interstate access and therefore, the State Routes remain the only other viable commercial corridors. Thus, it is important that these areas develop in a consistent manner to ensure the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards, and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(g)
In recent years, Nebo Road has emerged as a mixed use corridor in the City of Hiram, Georgia, with commercial and residential developments throughout the length of the thruway. The City of Hiram, Georgia's, portion of Nebo Road extends from State Route 92 to Dallas Nebo Road. As Nebo Road continues to develop, it will be important to ensure continuity with design, quality, workmanship and materials in order to complete a visually pleasing development area.
