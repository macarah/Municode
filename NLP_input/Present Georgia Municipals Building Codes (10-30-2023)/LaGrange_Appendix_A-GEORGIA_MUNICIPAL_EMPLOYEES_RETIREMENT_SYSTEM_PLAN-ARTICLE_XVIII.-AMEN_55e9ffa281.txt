ARTICLE XVIII. - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

Section 18.01. - Amendment of the Plan by an Adopting Employer.
The Governing Authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of its elections in the Adoption Agreement; provided, however, that no such amendment shall:
(a)
Reduce the previously accrued benefits of any Participant or Beneficiary; or,
(b)
Authorize or permit any part of the Trust Fund held by the Board to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries; or,
(c)
Operate to deprive any Participant or Beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably Vested in him under the Plan prior to such amendment, except that the Governing Authority may make any and all changes or modifications to the Adoption Agreement necessary to qualify the Plan or to keep the Plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto; or,
(d)
Become effective until approved by the Administrator. In order to be approved by the Administrator, any amendment must comply with all applicable state and federal laws and the Master Plan. If the Administrator does not approve an amendment, the Administrator shall continue to administer the Plan as if such amendment had not been made.
In no event may an Adopting Employer amend the Master Plan or the GMEBS Trust Agreement.
Section 18.02. - Amendment of Plan by GMEBS.
The Board hereby reserves the right to amend the Master Plan or the elective provisions of the Adoption Agreement in its sole discretion without the consent of the Adopting Employers or of Participants (or any Beneficiaries thereof). Any modification, alteration, or amendment made in accordance with this Section may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate. A certified copy of the resolution of the Board making such amendment shall be delivered to the Administrator and the Adopting Employers. The Plan shall be amended in the manner and effective as of the date set forth in such resolution, and the Adopting Employers, Employees, Participants, Beneficiaries, the Administrator, and all others having any interest under the Plan shall be bound thereby.
Section 18.03. - Amendment for Qualification of Plan.
(a)
It is the intent of the Board that the Plan shall be and remain qualified for tax purposes under the Code. The Administrator shall promptly submit the Master Plan for approval under the Code and all expenses incident thereto shall be borne by the GMEBS Investment Fund. With the approval of the Board, the Practitioner may make any modifications, alterations, or amendments to the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or Addendum necessary to obtain and retain approval of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate as may be necessary to establish and maintain the status of the Plan as qualified under the provisions of the Code or in compliance with other federal legislation, as now in effect or hereafter enacted, and the regulations issued thereunder. Any modification, alteration, or amendment of the Plan, made in accordance with this Section, may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate. A certified copy of the resolution of the Board approving such amendment shall be delivered to the Administrator and the Adopting Employers, and the Plan shall be amended in the manner and effective as of the date set forth in such resolution, and the Adopting Employers, Employees, Participants, beneficiaries, Administrator, and all others having any interest under the Plan shall be bound thereby.
(b)
With the approval of the Board, on and after February 17, 2005, the Practitioner shall amend the Plan on behalf of all Adopting Employers, including those Adopting Employers who have adopted the Plan prior to this restatement of the Plan, for changes in the Code, the regulations thereunder, revenue rulings, other statements published by Internal Revenue Service, including model, sample, or other required good faith amendments (but only if their adoption will not cause such Plan to be individually designed), and for corrections of prior approved plans. These amendments shall be applied to all Adopting Employers. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for all Adopting Employers before the effective date of February 17, 2005.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Practitioner shall no longer have the authority to amend the Plan on behalf of any Adopting Employer as of either:
(1)
the date the Internal Revenue Service requires the Adopting Employer to file Form 5300 as an individually designed plan as a result of an amendment by the Adopting Employer to incorporate a type of Plan not allowable in a volume submitter plan; or
(2)
as of the date of the Plan is otherwise considered an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the amendments.
If the Adopting Employer is required to obtain a determination letter for any reason in order to maintain reliance on the advisory letter, the Practitioner's authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Adopting Employer is conditioned on the Plan receiving a favorable determination letter. In any event, any amendment made by the Practitioner is subject to the approval of the Board.
GMEBS will maintain or have maintained on behalf of the Practitioner, a record of the Participating Employers, and GMEBS on behalf of the Practitioner will make reasonable and diligent efforts to ensure that Adopting Employers have actually received and are aware of all Plan amendments and that such Adopting Employers adopt new documents when necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall supersede other provisions of the Plan to the extent those other provisions are inconsistent.
Section 18.04. - Termination by Adopting Employer.
(a)
The Adopting Employer expects the Plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate its Plan and Contributions thereunder at any time by action of the Governing Authority, subject to the Administrator's approval. Such termination shall be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance or resolution (as applicable) by the Governing Authority terminating the Plan. Such ordinance shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Board governing Plan termination to the extent they are consistent with this provision.
(b)
Upon termination, all Eligible Employees shall be deemed to be Participants, and the Accrued Benefits of such Participants shall be Vested to the extent funded. The Pension Committee shall notify Participants, Terminated Participants, Retired Participants, and Beneficiaries of the termination of the Plan, and shall provide a copy of such notice and the names and addresses of the persons notified to the Administrator.
(c)
Upon termination, the Adopting Employer shall provide to the Administrator current Participant information necessary to calculate Accrued Benefits. Upon receipt of such information, the Administrator shall prepare a list of all the Adopting Employer's Participants, Retired Participants, Terminated Participants, and Beneficiaries, showing for each the present value of his Accrued Benefit, as determined by the GMEBS Actuary as of the date of termination.
(d)
The Administrator, in accordance with the Board's current rules and regulations, and with generally accepted accounting practices, shall determine the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the termination date. All mandatory Employee Contributions, if any, plus interest, shall be paid from the Trust Fund to the Participants, to the extent of available Trust Fund assets. The Administrator shall then deduct from the Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMEBS for services provided in terminating the Plan. The Administrator, pursuant to the Board's rules and regulations, shall then allocate the remaining assets for distribution of the present value of Accrued Benefits in lump sums to the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining Plan assets would be insufficient to provide the present value of Accrued Benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets shall be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes shall receive no benefit. The pro rata allocation referred to above will be determined based upon the comparative value of each class member's Accrued Benefit (present value expressed in a lump sum) when measured against the lump sum present value of Accrued Benefits for the class as a whole.
CLASS A — Retired Participants or Beneficiaries who are receiving payments as of the termination date.
CLASS B — Participants delaying Retirement beyond the Normal Retirement Date.
CLASS C — Participants eligible for Early Retirement.
CLASS D — Other Participants, terminated or active, who have met the requirements for vesting as of the termination date.
CLASS E — All other Participants on a pro rata basis. Payment of benefits to Retired Participants, Beneficiaries, and Participants by the Administrator as a result of a Plan termination shall be limited solely to the assets available in the Trust Fund.
(e)
In its termination ordinance, the Governing Authority shall instruct the Administrator as to the distribution of excess assets, if any, remaining after the satisfaction of Accrued Benefits for the classes enumerated herein. In the absence of such instructions, any excess assets shall be distributed to the Adopting Employer.
(f)
Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the Adoption Agreement, Master Plan, and GMEBS Trust Agreement shall be regarded as terminated as to that Adopting Employer and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim herein.
Section 18.05. - Amendment of the Plan to Transfer Assets; Termination of Contract.
(a)
The Adopting Employer may amend the Adoption Agreement by ordinance or resolution (as applicable) so as to provide for the transfer of assets to a successor trustee and to terminate the existing Contract between the Adopting Employer and the Board. Any such ordinance or resolution shall comply with Section 18.01 and with the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Board regarding amendment and transfer of Plan assets, to the extent they are consistent with this Section.
(b)
In addition to other requirements, such ordinance or resolution shall:
(1)
Designate a new trustee or trustees to replace the Board;
(2)
Establish a month-end termination date, which shall be used for purposes of valuing the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets and which shall be fixed by the Administrator, taking into account the time reasonably required to liquidate GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund assets (if necessary) for purposes of the termination and transfer, the impact of the termination on the financial integrity of the Retirement System, and the time reasonably required for GMEBS and the terminating Employer to complete necessary administrative tasks associated with the termination. The termination date will be no earlier than forty-five (45) days after the Adopting Employer provides written notice to the Administrator of its intent to terminate;
(3)
Provide that after the established termination date, GMEBS shall have no further responsibility or obligation to administer the terminating Employer's retirement plan, except as otherwise agreed and provided for by GMEBS and the terminating Employer in the ordinance or resolution;
(4)
Provide that the value of assets of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the established termination date shall be determined based upon the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as reflected in the unaudited financial statements for the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund as of the established termination date, subject to verification and reconciliation against the most recent GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund audit coinciding with or following the termination date.
(5)
Provide for the transfer of assets held in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund to the successor trustee as follows:
(A)
That no transfer shall take place until a successor Code Section 401(a) retirement plan and trust document have been adopted by the Adopting Employer and furnished to GMEBS, together with a current IRS determination letter or an opinion letter from an attorney confirming that the successor retirement plan is tax qualified under Code Section 401(a);
(B)
That as soon as reasonably practicable after the established termination date, the Administrator will make an initial transfer to the successor trustee of an amount to be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund, as reflected in the then most recently completed unaudited monthly financial statement for the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund; and that prior to the completion of the initial transfer, the Administrator shall deduct from the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMEBS for services provided in effecting the termination of the Adopting Employer's participation in GMEBS and the transfer of assets to the successor trustee;
(C)
That as soon as reasonably practicable after completion of the GMEBS Retirement Fund unaudited financial statement for the month including the established termination date, the Administrator will make a second transfer to the successor trustee in an amount equal to the remainder of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets, if any; and that in any event distribution of assets to the successor trustee shall be completed within the time limits specified in the GMEBS Trust Agreement;
(D)
That after the established termination date, any funds remaining in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund shall not share in the gains or losses of the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund, notwithstanding any provision of the GMEBS Master Plan or Trust Agreement to the contrary; and that any investment gains or losses that would otherwise be credited to or debited from the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund after the established termination date shall not be taken into account. Rather, after the established termination date through completion of the transfer of assets, any amount remaining in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund shall earn interest at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account which shall be credited monthly until the transfer of assets is completed; and,
(E)
That if the audit of the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund for the year including the established termination date reflects that the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund on the termination date was understated or overstated in the unaudited financial statement relied upon, then GMEBS or the Adopting Employer shall remit to the other the amount of any overpayment or underpayment, unless said amount is less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000). Such remittance shall be made in a lump sum with interest. Said interest shall be calculated at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account and credited monthly as of the last day of each month following the established termination date up until the date of the remittance.
(6)
State that the existing retirement rights of Employees, Participants, and Beneficiaries shall not be impaired.
(7)
Provide that upon completion of the transfer of assets, the GMEBS Board of Trustees shall have no further fiduciary responsibility for investment of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets or payment of liabilities, and the Adopting Employer's Contract and participation under the GMEBS Trust Agreement shall be considered terminated.
Section 18.06. - Involuntary Termination.
(a)
The Board may involuntarily terminate the Plan as to an Adopting Employer in the event of any of the following occurrences:
(1)
Failure of the Employer to comply with the terms of the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or GMEBS Trust Agreement including, but not limited to, failure to pay required Contributions in a timely manner;
(2)
Receipt of written notice from an Adopting Employer's Governing Authority of its intent to discontinue further Contributions;
(3)
Insistence by the Employer on enforcing an amendment to the Adoption Agreement which the Board has disapproved; or
(4)
Failure of the Adopting Employer to maintain qualification status under Code Sections 401 (a) and 414(d).
(b)
The rights, benefits, and entitlements under the Plan of any Participant, including those of his Beneficiary, any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, before or after Retirement, death, or other termination of employment shall, upon the failure of the Adopting Employer to pay and to continue to pay its required Contributions, be limited as specified in this Article.
(c)
In the event of an involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board may in its sole discretion adopt a resolution providing for: (i) designation of the members of the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustees for the Plan; (ii) designation of a person or entity other than the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustee for the Plan; or (iii) outright termination of the Plan and distribution of assets to Participants and Beneficiaries. The specific terms and conditions associated with involuntary termination shall be as provided in the Board resolution.
(d)
The Administrator shall notify the Governing Authority, Participants, and Beneficiaries in writing of an involuntary termination and the reasons therefor. Said notice shall also fix a termination date. Upon the request of the Administrator, the Employer shall within a reasonable period provide the Administrator with the last known addresses of Participants and Beneficiaries for this purpose.
(e)
The Administrator shall determine the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the termination date in accordance with the procedures described in Section 5(b)(4) of this Article. The Board shall deduct from the Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMESBS for services provided in effecting termination of the Adopting Employer's participation in GMEBS.
(f)
Successor Trustee.
(1)
Governing Authority as Successor Trustee. If upon voluntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution designates the members of the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustees, the Adopting Employer shall be obligated to furnish GMEBS with a successor retirement plan and related documents as provided in Section 18.05(b)(5)(A). Distribution of assets to the Governing Authority or to a designee specified by the Governing Authority in writing, as successor trustee, shall then occur in accordance with the transfer procedures described in Section 18.05(b)(5). Payment of benefits to Retired Participants and Beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the Governing Authority, as successor trustees, as of the termination date, except as otherwise provided in the Board's termination resolution.
(2)
Other Entity as Successor Trustee. If upon involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution designates a successor trustee other than the members of the Employer's Governing Authority, distribution of assets to the successor trustee shall occur in accordance with the transfer procedures described in Section 18.05(b)(5) upon the Board's receipt of retirement plan and related documents as described in Section 18.05(b)(5)(A), and any other information reasonably requested by the Board. Payment of benefits to the Retired Participants and Beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the successor trustee as of the termination date, except as otherwise provided in the Board's termination resolution.
(3)
Termination without Successor Trustee. If upon involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution terminates the Employer's Plan outright, the assets of the Employer's Trust Fund will not be transferred to a successor trustee, but will be distributed to Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with and subject to the termination provisions of Section 18.04(b)-(f), except as otherwise provided in this subsection. The Employer shall provide current Participant information necessary to calculate Accrued Benefits as required under Section 18.04(c), within a reasonable period after the Administrator's request for such information. Any excess assets remaining after satisfaction of Accrued Benefits and payment of the termination fee shall be distributed to the Employer.
(g)
Freezing of Benefit Accruals. In the event of an Employer's failure to pay required Contributions, the GMEBS Board may by resolution freeze benefit accruals under the Employer's Plan, as an alternative to involuntary termination. If the Board adopts such a resolution, the Employer's Plan must continue to be maintained as a qualified plan and the Employer will be responsible for funding benefits as determined under the frozen Plan's provisions. The Board's resolution to freeze benefit accruals shall specify the extent to which Service and Earnings after the freeze date will or will not be counted for purposes of computing the amount of benefits payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the minimum service requirements for vesting and benefit eligibility under the Plan. The resolution shall also specify the conditions for recommencing benefit accruals under the Plan. The resolution may also provide that, in the event of an Employer's continued failure to pay required Contributions, the Employer's Plan will be terminated outright as of a date certain or upon the Board's adoption of a resolution providing for outright termination, consistent with the provisions of subsection (f)(3).
(h)
The Board in its discretion may require an Employer to obtain appropriate IRS approval of the qualified status of the terminating Plan or a successor plan.
(i)
In the event that an Adopting Employer fails to comply with the terms of the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or GMEBS Trust Agreement including, but not limited to, failure to pay required Contributions in a timely manner, the Board may in its sole discretion pursue any other legal or equitable means that it deems appropriate, including the filing of a writ of mandamus, to facilitate such compliance.
Section 18.07. - Termination of the Master Plan by the Board.
The Board reserves the right to completely terminate the Master Plan and the GMEBS Trust Agreement. In such an event, the provisions of Section 18.04 shall be applied to each Adopting Employer.
