Sec. 14-243. - Order of the court.
(a)
If, after notice and hearing as provided in section 14-242, the court determines that the dwelling or building under consideration is unfit for human habitation, or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use; or is vacant, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall issue an order that states in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing, an order as follows:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation, and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.
(b)
The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in the Real Estate Appraiser Classification and Regulation Act (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alternation, or improvement of the structure shall be the costs necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations enforced in the jurisdiction.
(Ord. No. 2008-O-004, § 9.5, 11-4-2008)
Sec. 14-244. - Failure to comply with order of the court.
If the owner fails to comply with an order of the court to repair, alter, improve, remove, close, or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the administrator may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The administrator shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the dwelling, building, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this dwelling, building, or structure is prohibited and unlawful."
Sec. 14-245. - Salvage of reusable materials.
If the administrator has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any money shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid, according to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(a)(6). The administrator and city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from, or occasioned by, the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials consistent with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(a)(6).
Sec. 14-246. - Lien on property.
(a)
The cost of repairing, altering, improving, removing, closing or demolishing the dwelling, building or structure incurred by the administrator in accordance with exercising his authority as described in this division, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Said lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required in this division. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
(b)
Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the administrator shall transmit to the city treasurer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the administrator shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of city treasurer to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including, specifically, O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The city treasurer shall remit the amount collected to the city council.
(c)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city treasurer of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this section.
(d)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this division shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section, together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the city and the city treasurer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(e)
This section is intended to adopt and be consistent with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(b).
Sec. 14-247. - Waiver of lien.
The city may waive and release any lien imposed on property if the owner of such property enters into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
Sec. 14-248. - Appellate review.
Review of the municipal court's order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the city superior court, according to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
Sec. 14-249. - Summary proceedings.
Nothing in this division shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise when, upon a majority vote of the city council, the city determines that a nuisance exists and the repair, alteration, improvement, removal, closing or demolition will not exceed $1,000.00.
