ARTICLE V. - VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION DEVICES

Sec. 58-200. - Purpose.
The City of Snellville finds that at least one business within the city limits of Snellville employs the practice of the immobilization or "booting" of vehicles by private companies. Based upon the State of Georgia's regulation of the impoundment and removal of trespassing vehicle upon private property, the City of Snellville believes that any local legislation to regulate the practice of vehicle immobilization or "booting" would be preempted by the state. In an effort to protect the citizens of Snellville from unknowingly parking upon property where their vehicle may be immobilized or "booted", the city has determined that the notice requirements of this article are necessary.

Said notice may be either oral or written, but may not be made by merely, yelling across the parking lot or placing a written notice on said vehicle. Further, said notice shall be made in a cordial, non-confrontational manner. It shall be the responsibility of the booting operator to prove that a warning meeting the requirements of this article has been issued.
