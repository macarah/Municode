d.
The sheriff's department and the county health department shall approve or deny their approval within ten days of an application for a temporary use. If denied, reasons for the denial shall be stated in writing. Within 15 days of the receipt of a completed application, the zoning administrator shall approve or deny the temporary use in writing to the applicant.

Establishments with five or fewer manufacturing employees in connection with a commercial activity are considered to be primarily commercial and compatible with a commercial district. Manufacturing activities with more than five employees would be considered large enough to belong in a manufacturing district with other such uses rather than in a commercial district.)

None.
E.
All accessory uses must meet the following standards:
