(a)
Every question of order at a council meeting shall be decided by the chair without debate, subject to an appeal of the council, and the chair may call for the consent of the council on any question of order. If repeated calls do not produce order, the member is to be called by name.
(b)
Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a question, he is to withdraw, and when such an interest has appeared his voice is to be disallowed.
(c)
No motion shall be debated or put until the motion is seconded. It is then, and not until then, in possession of council, and cannot be withdrawn but by leave of council.
(d)
When a proposition is moved which is useless or inexpedient, the previous question is introduced for suppressing, for that time, the motion and its discussion, in which case the main question is to be put immediately without any further debate, and in the form in which it then exists; but, as the previous question applies that day only, and it may recur again, if it is desired to suppress entirely, the motion shall be to postpone indefinitely.
(e)
When a proper motion is made, but information wanted, the motion is to postpone to a day certain.
(f)
When a matter is introduced claiming present attention, but which it is desired to reserve for a more suitable occasion, the order is to lay on the table, and it may then be called for at any time.

On motion to amend an ordinance, any member may move to commit it or refer it to a committee, and the question for commitment shall be first put. An amendment to an amendment is admitted, but to amend an amendment to an amendment is not.
(h)
The question is to be put first on the affirmative and then on the negative side.
(i)
When a question has been moved and seconded, and been put by the chair in the affirmative and negative, it becomes a full question, and cannot be debated afterwards, unless under motion for reconsideration.
(j)
The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms, but to arraign the motives of those who propose or advocate it is a personality and against order.

Any member shall be heard at any time on a matter of personal privilege, and such request to be heard shall be given precedence.

(1)
Illegal activity;
(2)
Employment that by virtue of association will reflect upon the reputation of the city; and,
(3)
High hazard or fatiguing work which might detract from or reduce city job performance.

Prior to beginning any regularly scheduled outside employment, employees will obtain specific written approval from the city administrator or his/her designee on request forms which indicate the name of the outside employer, the nature of the work, hours of work, address and telephone number where the employee can be reached. Such information will become a part of the employee's official personnel record.

Any employee accepting or engaging in outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make arrangements with the outside employer to be available to respond immediately to any emergency call of duty whenever the city administrator or his/her designee shall determine that the employee's services are necessary.
