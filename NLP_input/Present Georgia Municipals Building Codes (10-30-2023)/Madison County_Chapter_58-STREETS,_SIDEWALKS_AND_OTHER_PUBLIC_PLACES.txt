(3)
Once the person has obtained the required signatures on 100 percent of the right-of-way acquisition document(s), he or she shall turn the original right-of-way acquisition document(s) over to the county clerk for verification that all have been appropriately executed. Upon such verification, the clerk shall place the issue on the next available board agenda, and shall notify the person as well as the road superintendent to be present at that board meeting.
(4)
The board shall, at that meeting, consider whether to accept the private road, constructed before April 25, 2022, applying the following criteria:

If the road is rejected, the right-of-way acquisition document(s) shall be considered rejected, shall not be recorded, and shall be destroyed. If the road is accepted, the board shall determine the appropriate level of maintenance/improvement to be initially provided and shall assign the priority of such work in the context of the county's road improvement and maintenance schedule, and such direction shall be included in the motion to accept the road.
(c)
Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the board's discretion to acquire right-of-way by purchase, gift, or condemnation for the construction or improvement of new or existing county roads, nor to restrict the board's discretion to establish special tax districts for the construction of new roads or improvement and/or maintenance of existing roads.
