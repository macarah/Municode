The application of the Ordinance to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;

Appealing an action of the Codes Enforcement Officer.

Finding of fact however may not be appealed. Appeals of the granting or denial of a conditional use permit or variance shall be made as set forth below in Section 155 and Section 156. All other appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of action by the Codes Enforcement Officer.
The Board of Zoning Appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning administrative actions of the Codes Enforcement Office related to this Ordinance. Applications for appeals may be obtained from and submitted to the Codes Enforcement Officer, who will transmit them to the Board of Zoning Appeals for its consideration.
When an administrative action of the Codes Enforcement Officer is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however the Codes Enforcement Officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property.
Then, the Codes Enforcement Officer may certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the Board of Zoning Appeals or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
When an application for appeal of an action of the Codes Enforcement Officer is received, the Board of Zoning Appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Bowdon or Carroll County at lease fifteen (15) days before the hearing.
