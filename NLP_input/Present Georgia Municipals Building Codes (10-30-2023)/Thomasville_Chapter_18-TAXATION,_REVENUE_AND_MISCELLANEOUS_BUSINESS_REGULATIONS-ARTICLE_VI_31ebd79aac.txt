Sec. 18-170. - Purpose.
modified
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating peddling, itinerant traders, traveling salesmen, and other door-to-door salesmen, generally known as peddlers. Such persons typically market magazines, appliances, house wares, and other goods and services by going door to door in neighborhoods and business districts. Peddling is sometimes carried out by questionable organizations or individuals, with illegitimate products, or with no intent to deliver, and unlicensed peddling by unregistered peddlers exposes the citizens of Thomasville to fraudulent peddlers and harms legitimate businesses. Therefore, this article requires peddlers seek licenses, authorizes background checks, and imposes certain restrictions. However, it is not the intent of this article to require sales representatives, visiting business or persons they previously have made appointments with, or already have a legitimate business relationship with, to obtain a peddler's license. Neither is it the intent of this article to unconstitutionally infringe upon the First Amendment rights of persons going door-to-door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing, or other free speech reasons.
