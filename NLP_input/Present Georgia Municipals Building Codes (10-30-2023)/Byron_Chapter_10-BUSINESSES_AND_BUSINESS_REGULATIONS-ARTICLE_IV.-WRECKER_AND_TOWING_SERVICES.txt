Vehicles damaged in motor vehicle accidents and collisions which cannot safely be driven from the scene;
(2)

(6)
Vehicles of the city which become mechanically disabled.
(b)
Any wrecker service which desires to be placed on the rotational call list shall apply for such placement to the police chief. Each such wrecker service, by so applying, acknowledges that placement on the rotational call list is a privilege, not a right. The police chief shall refer the application to the building official, who shall inspect the wrecker service premises, or who shall designate the code enforcement officer to inspect the wrecker service premises, for compliance with the provisions of this Code, appendix A, part IV, section 6, special exceptions or section 9, permitted uses, subsection (ff), as applicable, as well as subsections 10-153(b), (d)(1), (e) and (h) of chapter 10, article IV of this Code. Upon receipt of written approval from the building official, the police chief and/or the building official shall obtain the agreement by the wrecker service to comply with the provisions of subsections 10-153(f), (g) and (h), chapter 10, article IV. They, or either of them, shall further obtain the proof of insurance required by subsection 10-153(i), chapter 10, article IV, and said proof shall be provided annually thereafter if the wrecker service is placed on the rotational call list. The police chief shall prepare and maintain a rotational call list of no more than six qualified wrecker services which are engaged in the towing business in the city on a regular basis and who meet the qualifications, standards and requirements enumerated in this article. The rotational call list will be maintained by the police department, and a current copy shall be provided to all shift supervisors. The approved rotational call list shall initially be ordered so that the two current approved wrecker services with heavy duty wreckers shall occupy the second and fourth positions on the list, and approved wrecker services shall be placed on-call sequentially, proceeding down the list of wrecker services, each service receiving two months of the year. If there are less than six wrecker services on the rotational call list, then the first wrecker service on the list shall receive the next month after the last wrecker service on the list, with every effort made to evenly distribute the on-call months. The police chief shall provide the 911 center for Peach County with the name of the on-call wrecker service for each month. The police chief shall have no authority to waive compliance with any of the qualifications, standards, and requirements enumerated in this article. A continuing responsibility for eligibility shall include compliance with all of the requirements contained in this article, including, but not limited to, response time to calls made to the on-call wrecker service company to ensure efficient service on a 24-hour basis and provision to the police chief of proof of insurance annually.
(c)
If for any reason it shall become necessary for the police department to remove any damaged or undamaged vehicle from the public right-of-way or from other public places, the senior Byron police or officer on scene shall contact the 911 center for Peach County by radio to request that the on-call wrecker service be dispatched to the location. However, if the owner or person in possession of a vehicle about to be removed designates a wrecker service to be used, it shall be the duty of the investigating officer to inform the senior officer on scene of this request, and the senior officer, or the investigating officer if no senior officer is on scene, shall then notify the 911 center of this request before requesting the on-call wrecker service to be dispatched to the scene. All requests for wrecker dispatch, if made by the Byron police, shall be made by radio. In no event shall an investigating officer or senior officer on scene undertake to call directly for a wrecker service by personal or city issued cellular telephone, but all such calls shall be made by radio through the 911 center.
(d)
No Byron police officer may provide the names or telephone numbers of available wrecker services to the person in control of or the owner of any vehicle being towed, other than the name of the on-call wrecker service. Officers may allow such persons a reasonable time to use a smart phone or other means to look up a wrecker service if the on-call wrecker service is unacceptable to such person, but may do so only when, in the judgment of the officer, the officer's safety or the safety of the driver, owner or other persons will not be jeopardized. In every instance where an arrest of the driver, owner or person in control of the vehicle to be towed has been made or is being made, the on-call wrecker service shall be used. In every instance where the driver, owner or person in control of a vehicle to be towed is not present and cannot be immediately located, or has left or been removed from the location of the vehicle by medical personnel, the on-call wrecker service shall be used. No vehicle shall be left on or in any public right-of-way in any instance where the owner or person in control of a vehicle to be towed is not present and cannot be immediately located, or has left or been removed from the location of the vehicle by medical personnel. All such vehicles shall be towed, and no vehicle shall be left to be retrieved later or by another person.
(e)
If a wrecker has not arrived at the scene where needed within 25 minutes of being dispatched by the 911 center, the investigating officer may contact, or if a senior officer is on scene, request that the senior officer contact, the next approved wrecker service on the approved call list and cancel the dispatch of the previously requested wrecker service. In no instance of cancellation of the on-call wrecker service due to failure to arrive within 25 minutes shall any public safety officer of the city request any wrecker service to be dispatched other than the wrecker service which would have the next on-call month.
(f)
In the event any vehicle owned by the city should need to be towed, the on-call wrecker service shall be contacted by radio as provided in subsection (b) of this section, which shall be utilized in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as for any other vehicle removed from public right-of-way at the request of a public safety official of the city.
(g)
The police chief shall develop and submit to the city council for approval a standard operating procedure in conformity with the provisions of this section, including notice that failure to adhere to the requirements set forth subjects employees to discipline.
(Ord. No. 2002-18, § 12-151, 12-30-2002; Ord. No. 2018-10 , 9-24-2018; Ord. No. 2021-9 , 7-12-2021)
Sec. 10-153. - Qualifications of wrecker service companies.
(a)
Any wrecker service desiring to be qualified to be placed on the rotating schedule for use by the city, under the conditions set out in this article, shall file an application with the chief of police. The police chief shall have no authority to waive compliance with any of the qualifications, standards, and requirements enumerated in this article. A continuing responsibility for eligibility shall include compliance with the requirements contained in this article concerning response time to calls made to the scheduled wrecker service company to ensure efficient service on a 24-hour basis.
(b)
The wrecker service owners, including any holder of more than 25 percent of the stock of a corporation, and all members of a partnership must submit to a background police and general records check for prior offenses or irregularities to determine suitability, reliability and financial stability in order to properly protect the public against abuse, neglect or malfeasance. No wrecker service owned by a corporation having a stockholder who holds more than 25 percent of the stock who has been convicted of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude shall be placed on the approved call list. No wrecker service owned by a partnership having a partner who has been convicted of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude shall be placed on the approved call list. No wrecker service owned by a person who has been convicted of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude shall be placed on the approved call list.
(c)
Every wrecker operator shall have the proper driver's license from this state for the type of vehicle which he is operating. All drivers shall also be qualified under state public service commission rules and regulations.

At least one class A and one class C wrecker in lawfully operational condition and marked as provided in subsection 10-154(h), subject to the provision of subparagraph (4) below. No wrecker service may satisfy the obligation for required wreckers set forth herein by any cooperation agreement or cover agreement as defined in subsection 10-151, and any leased wrecker operated by a wrecker service must be marked as provided in subsection 10-154(h).
(2)
Each approved wrecker service shall provide to the police chief and the building official a list of its available wreckers. Whenever a wrecker service which is the on-call wrecker service does not have a wrecker of the necessary class immediately available for a rotational call, the officer requesting a wrecker shall immediately notify the 911 center to contact the next wrecker service on the on-call rotation list to dispatch a wrecker of the required class. This shall not displace the on-call wrecker service from the remainder of its month on call. However, on and after January 1, 2023, this subparagraph shall apply only when the on-call wrecker service is without the required class of wrecker due to mechanical breakdown of the wrecker of the necessary class or when its wrecker of that class is already dispatched or in use handling another vehicle. On and after January 1, 2023, in the event of mechanical breakdown causing a wrecker service to be completely without a class of wrecker as specified on subparagraph (1) of this subsection, the wrecker shall be returned to service within 45 days, or the wrecker service will be removed from the rotational call list.
(3)
The provisions of this subsection must be complied with at all times by every wrecker service on the rotational call list to remain on the active rotation list. The application for a business license by any wrecker service which seeks to be placed on the rotational call list, the renewal of a business license by any wrecker service which has been placed on the rotational call list, and any request by a wrecker service already in possession of a business license to be placed on the rotational call list, shall constitute a certification by the wrecker service that it is in compliance with the provisions of this subsection.
(4)
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this subsection (d) shall not prevent a wrecker service from remaining upon the rotational call list if, at the time of adoption of the amended ordinance from which this section is derived, said wrecker service was on the active rotational call list in good standing and not suspended therefrom. However, any wrecker service so exempted must come into full compliance herewith on or before January 1, 2023. The police chief and the building official shall maintain a list of any such wrecker services and shall determine that any such service seeking to remain on the rotational call list has come into compliance with all provisions of this section by said date.
(e)
Each wrecker shall carry at all times when in service or use a full complement of service items which includes a fire extinguisher, chains, proper emergency reflectors, and other equipment, including dollies where appropriate, needed for lifting, extricating, or righting wrecked vehicles and the removal of such vehicles by towing or carting.

(j)
Approved wrecker services may not enter into cover agreements or cooperation agreements which, in the judgment of the police chief, building official or code enforcement officer, enable any wrecker service to increase call volume or relieve it or another wrecker service from any requirement set forth in this article, or which directs any business to a wrecker service not on the rotational call list. No approved wrecker service may, either with or without a cover or cooperation agreement, utilize the services of a wrecker service which not on the rotational call list in the event a tow job requires the use of more wreckers than are owned or leased by the on call wrecker service.

The provisions of this subsection and the provisions applicable to wrecker services under this article must be complied with at all times by every wrecker service on the rotational call list in order to remain on the rotational call list. The application for a business license by any wrecker service which seeks to be placed on the rotational call list, the renewal of a business license by any wrecker service which has been placed on the rotational call list, and any request by a wrecker service already in possession of a business license to be placed on the rotational call list, shall constitute a certification by the wrecker service that it is in compliance with the provisions of this subsection.

Sec. 10-157. - Removal from approved call list.
(a)
If a wrecker service which has been included by the police chief on the rotational call list is found by the police chief, the building official, or the code enforcement officer to be out of compliance with any of the requirements provided for in this article, or if any such wrecker service violates any of the approval specifications, the police chief or the building official shall notify the wrecker service in writing of the lack of compliance. The wrecker service shall correct such deficiency within 15 days. If compliance is not achieved within said time, the police chief or the building official shall summarily remove the wrecker service from the rotational call list. If a wrecker service is so removed from the approved call list, the wrecker service shall be notified in writing by the police chief within three business days after expiration of the corrective period. If the building official removes a wrecker service from the approved call list, the wrecker service shall be notified in writing by the building official within three business days after expiration of the corrective period. If the noncompliance involves an act which cannot be corrected except by non-repetition of same, then a second violation after the written notice shall result in removal from the rotational call list. The wrecker service may be excluded from the rotational call list for a period not exceeding one year, at which time the wrecker service may make application to be returned to the rotation list. The wrecker service, upon approval, shall be placed at the bottom of the approved call list, as it then exists. If a wrecker service is removed from the rotational call list during a month for which it is the on-call wrecker service, the next wrecker service on the rotational call list shall become the on-call wrecker service and shall complete the month for the excluded wrecker service and shall the be the on-call wrecker service for the following month, during which it would already have been scheduled as the on-call wrecker service.
(b)
Any removal from the approved call list which exceeds 30 days may be appealed to the city council. Such appeal shall be filed within five working days of the written decision notifying the wrecker service of the removal from the approved call list by the chief of police. Such appeal shall set forth the reasons why the wrecker service contends that the proposed action should not have been taken and, in reasonable detail, the grounds and facts which the wrecker service contends support its position. Failure of the wrecker service to request a hearing within the specified time shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing, and the action of the chief of police shall be final.
(c)
If requested, a hearing shall be held within 45 days after the date of the filing of the request for a hearing with the city council. The wrecker service shall be provided five days' advance written notice of the hearing date by hand delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested. Such hearing shall be informal and not subject to the rules of evidence applicable in the courts of the State of Georgia, except that irrelevant and extraneous matters shall not be heard. The wrecker service may present relevant evidence concerning the facts. Upon hearing the facts, if the council finds that the alleged violations have not been satisfactorily shown to have existed, it may, but is not required to, return the wrecker service to the rotational call list. If the council is satisfied that the violations existed, the decision of the chief of police shall be upheld. In making its determination, the council may consider remedial measures undertaken by the wrecker service since its removal from the list.
