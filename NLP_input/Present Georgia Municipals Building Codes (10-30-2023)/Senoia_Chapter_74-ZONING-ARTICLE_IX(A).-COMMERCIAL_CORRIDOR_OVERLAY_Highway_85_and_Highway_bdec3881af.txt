Editor's note— Article IX has been renumbered as Article IX(A) in order to facilitate inclusion of Article IX(B).

Sec. 74-178. - Introduction.
Senoia Georgia is a small, enclave community with a recognized, historic town center. Senoia's early neighborhoods form a significant national register historic district. These historic assets lend character and an identity to the city and, together with Newnan, Senoia is one of only a few Southside communities with a sense of place.
Senoia lies along two regional arterials, Highway 85 and Highway 16, which form an important gateway to the community and is located within reasonable commuting distance of the Atlanta airport and major employment centers in the region. Downtown Senoia is the location of a station on the planned commuter rail line. At the doorstep of burgeoning Peachtree City in Fayette County, Senoia is poised for substantial residential and commercial growth.
Senoia seeks a commercial development model that will prevent creation of the all too familiar "strip commercial corridors" characterizing many undesirable commercial corridors.
The Senoia City Council tasked the city administrator with developing the regulatory tools necessary to preserving the historic character of the community while accommodating projected growth. The city administrator consulted with the Senoia Planning Commission that serves as the historic preservation commission in framing the underlying concepts influencing this Highway 85 and Highway 16 commercial overlay.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 9, § A, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-179. - Purpose.
The purpose of the overlay is to establish architectural design and site development standards for regulation of development and construction on Highway 85 and Highway 16 in the City of Senoia. Residential growth in Senoia is expected to propel commercial growth along these arterials. The city seeks standards that will ensure development of architecturally appealing and functional commercial settings. It is the express legislative intent of this overlay that strip or single lot, commercial development will undermine the objectives sought through adoption and implementation of this overlay.
These standards are intended to give direction to both owners and potential developers of property encompassed by the overlay. The further purpose is to ensure quality development and preserve and enhance Senoia's historic character and small town charm. The City of Senoia Comprehensive Plan projects an increase in population from an estimated 3,059 residents in 2006 to 7,800 in 2026. An expansion in commercial services will be needed to serve this market as well as the commuter market on Highway 85 and Highway 16. The overlay is intended to encourage development consistent with the City of Senoia Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 9, § B, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-180. - Applicability.
The standards and requirements of this Highway 85 and Highway 16 commercial overlay shall apply to all commercial properties within the geography depicted on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Senoia. These standards shall apply to all new construction and shall apply to the affected portions of any redevelopment site or refurbished building where such renovation exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value within the overlay.
Whenever the standards of the overlay impose a more restrictive standard than the provisions of any other ordinance, statute or covenant, the standards of the overlay shall govern.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 9, § C, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-181. - Geography.
The general boundary of the Highway 85 and Highway 16 commercial overlay shall be defined by those properties having frontage on Highway 85, between Seavy Street and the southern city limits, and/or on Highway 16, between Dead Oak Creek and the eastern city limits, to a depth of 1,000 feet. In no case shall these standards apply to that portion of Highway 85 properties also having frontage on an existing city street that comprises a depth of 300 feet on the lesser street frontage. The actual overlay zoning boundary shall be as approved by the mayor and city council and as subsequently designated on the official zoning map.

(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 9, § H, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-186. - Design requirements.
(a)
Transportation infrastructure. A primary objective of the overlay as concerns Highway 85 is establishment of a "secondary road network." Such a network is intended to minimize disruption of traffic flow on Highway 85 and to provide opportunities for provision of abundant landscaping characterizing the overlay. Platting of properties being developed within the overlay shall afford construction and dedication of such a network either through provision of single loaded building sites to the rear of the secondary road or by platting of building sites along Highway 85. In either case, a 40-foot landscaped buffer or, at the developer's option, a 30-foot buffer with berming having a minimum height of four feet, shall be maintained adjacent to the Highway 85 right-of-way, encroached upon only by public streets and sidewalks.
(1)
It is encouraged that each site plan submitted for any development within the overlay provide for present or future dedication of right-of-way as previous platting may accommodate for construction of public roads. Such roads shall provide access to property interior to the development. Approval of any site plan for development along the proposed secondary access road shall be conditioned upon agreement of the developer of the property to fully fund the cost of construction of such proposed public road along that development's frontage. The site plan shall consider the alignment of such secondary road on adjacent parcels and shall cooperate with the city in design and layout of an efficient and economical secondary road network.
(2)
Upon a finding by the city engineer that a development poses inordinate traffic impacts, the applicant shall prepare a professional traffic study according to the standard traffic methodology. In addition to the general standards of the methodology, the traffic study shall include weekend traffic generation and impact analysis. The traffic study shall also evaluate all intersections nearest to the site, or any area designated by the city engineer.
(b)
Interparcel access. Interparcel vehicle access between all contiguous office and commercial lots is encouraged.
(c)
Access. All building lots along Highway 85 shall be accessed from a city road; direct access from Highway 85 shall be as determined by GDOT. No building lot shall have direct access from Highway 85 or Highway 16 unless specifically approved by the city.
(1)
No new driveway shall be permitted to provide ingress or egress to property on Highway 85 following adoption of this overlay, except for the purpose of serving existing lots of record. Access to Highway 16 shall be controlled by limiting the number of curb cuts, which shall not exceed two for the first 200 feet of frontage, with 24 feet being the maximum curb cut width. The number of such cuts may be increased by one for each additional 150 feet of road frontage on Highway 16.
(d)
Street width. Where secondary roads are approved, the combined pavement and curb and gutter width of undivided streets within the overlay shall not exceed 24 feet.
(e)
Parking. Unless a parking courtyard design can be achieved, off-street parking shall be uniformly distributed across the building site. In the case of freestanding buildings or shopping centers that do not have a street along the front and rear of the property, the area between the front of the building and the right-of-way shall be limited to a maximum of 25 percent of the required parking and limited to a maximum of one double row of parking. A maximum of 50 percent of off-street parking shall be located to the sides of the building, with the remaining parking located to the rear of the building.
(1)
Development tracts having no public right-of-way to the rear of the site and accommodating truck loading areas to the rear of the principal building shall be exempt from these requirements; however, parking located between the front of the building and the right-of-way shall be limited to a maximum of 50 percent of the required parking.
(2)
No parking or service areas shall be permitted within 50 feet of the property line of an adjoining residential zoning lot. Parking and service areas shall be separated from adjoining residential zoning lots using a suitable landscaped screen across the entire width of this 50-foot buffer, which may be provided in combination with a fence or wall. Installation of such fence or wall shall not be a substitute for plant materials distributed appropriately across the entire buffer. Such screening shall achieve a reasonable visual separation between the properties, subject to approval by the city administrator.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 9, § I, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-187. - Parking.
A minimum of one parking space for every 300 square feet of commercial floor area available to the public shall be provided on all retail developments within the overlay. Any parking area re-construction involving an area equal to or greater than 50 percent of the paved surface shall trigger compliance with this article. Resurfacing shall not be deemed re-construction.
