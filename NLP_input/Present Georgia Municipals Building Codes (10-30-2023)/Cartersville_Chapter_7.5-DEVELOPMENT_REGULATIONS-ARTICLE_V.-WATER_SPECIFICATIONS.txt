(b)
Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If hydrants, blow-offs or air release valves are not available at the high places, the contractor shall make the necessary taps, as per the standard detail for tap construction, at points of highest elevation before the test is made and close the corporation stop after the test has been completed.
(c)
Prior to the pressure test, pipe laid in trenches shall be backfilled adequately to secure the pipe during the test. Any observed leakage shall require corrective measures to pipe lines and/or joints as otherwise provided for in these specifications and to the satisfaction of the inspector. During the final pressure test the specified pressure shall be maintained in the pipe being tested for a minimum time of one (1) hour. Test pressure shall be maintained within five (5) psi of the specified test pressure for the duration of the test. Should the pressure drop more than five (5) psi at any time during the test period, the pressure shall be restored to the specified test pressure. An accurate pressure gauge with graduation not greater than five (5) psi shall be used.
(d)
The city will furnish the necessary water for testing the lines. However, any water lost through breakage of lines or unnecessary or excessive flushing of line will be charged to the contractor. Each valved section must be flushed and tested at a pressure of two hundred (200) psi for one (1) hour. Lines shall be tested in sections in a manner that assures testing of the tapping valve and all main line valves. When testing at the above specified pressures, the rate of leakage shall not exceed fifteen (15) gallons per twenty-four (24) hours per inch diameter per mile of line. See the table below.
