ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS
DIVISION 1. - INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 28-65. - Design guidelines for major subdivisions and site developments.
(a)
Continuation of existing streets. Where feasible, existing streets shall be extended for access into the subdivision. Such extensions shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case shall be less than the required width. However, street extensions shall connect developments of similar uses only as defined by the zoning ordinance. In no case shall a street in an industrial development be connected to a street in a residential zoning district. Traffic loading on the existing street system must be considered. If the additional traffic volume is determined by the director to exceed the design specifications of the existing street and/or the nearest street intersection, the director may deny access or require the developer to improve the existing street and/or intersection approaches to accommodate the additional volume.
(b)
Linear street vertical grades. Maximum and minimum linear street grades shall be as follows:
(1)
County arterial street: not more than six percent.
(2)
County collector street: not more than ten percent.
(3)
Local streets: not more than 12 percent.
(4)
Alleys: not more than 12 percent.
(c)
Horizontal curvature. The minimum radii of centerline road curvature shall be as follows:
(1)
County arterial street: 300 feet.
(2)
County collector and local street: 200 feet.
(3)
Local streets: 100 feet.
(d)
Tangents. Between reverse curves, there shall be a tangent having a length not less than 50 feet on local streets and 100 feet on county collectors and 200 feet on county arterials.
(e)
Vertical alignment. There shall be a horizontal sight distance at all intersections, when measured from a height of three feet, according to the requirements of Chapter Three of the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control.
(f)
Intersection design. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible. No street intersection shall be at an angle of less than 78 degrees. Street intersections must be separated from each other in accordance with Table 3-1 in Chapter Three of the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control.
(g)
Cross slope. Street and road cross slopes shall be at least two percent (one-fourth inch per foot) measured tangent to the center run of the road. Appropriate cross slope design considerations shall be made for transitions into and through super elevations at curves.
(h)
Driveway turnouts/curb cuts. Where deemed necessary by the director, the driveway or entrance (residential or industrial) shall have a paved turnout, meeting Georgia DOT specifications. Commercial driveways or entrances shall have a paved turnout, meeting Georgia DOT specifications, extending from the edge of the existing pavement of at least 20 feet into the property.
(1)
Turnouts/curb cuts shall be designed and constructed so as not to release runoff waters onto the roadway but rather into curb inlets or roadside ditches before reaching the existing street/road. Runoff waters from a 25-year or less storm event are not allowed to drain off a driveway onto a street/road. In high traffic/volume areas (typically county arterials and collectors) designs accommodating larger storm events will be required.
(2)
No curb cut shall be located closer to the nearest radius return of the intersection of two streets than 100 feet. Curb cut spacing shall adhere to Table 3-1 "Driveway Spacing Criteria" in Chapter Three of the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control unless the width of the parcel requesting the curb cut is insufficient to achieve this standard because of the existence of curb cuts on adjacent parcels or where the length of the street on which such curb cut is proposed is less than 100 feet and only one parcel is served by such street. If either condition exists for a curb cut to be within 100 feet of the intersection of two streets, the director shall determine which location protects the rights of the property owner and the protection of safety of the public.

The requirements of this section shall apply to every major subdivision and site development and shall be planned for and provided by the developer by installation and/or payment prior to the approval of the final plat. Where indicated by an asterisk (*), the requirement is not necessarily applicable to a site development as shall be determined by the director in consultation with the developer.
(a)
* Street names. All streets shall be named and marked with MUTCD signs. Street names shall have the approval of the director and shall not duplicate, nor closely approximate phonetically or visually, the name of any other street in the county. A street that is in alignment with an existing street shall continue the name of the existing street.
(b)
Streets. All streets, whether public, private or curb cuts, shall be designed, constructed and paved in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
(1)
No street or drainage structure shall be accepted by the county until it shall have been in public use for two years (two-year warranty period) and all repairs required by the county have been completed to the satisfaction of the county.
(2)
To initiate the two-year warranty period the county must conduct an inspection of all drainage structures, the road, grading, grassing, and the use of best management practices for soil and erosion control. The developer/owner must post a surety or cash bond per section 28-82 of this chapter.
(3)
It is the responsibility of the developer to maintain all streets until they are accepted by the county, and issue a surety bond to the county, to provide for such maintenance and repair, should the developer not be able to conduct the required repairs, as provided by this chapter.
(4)
The developer shall install all necessary traffic control signs, signals, and street name signs as required by the county or GDOT at its sole cost. In addition, the subdivider shall provide suitable ground cover, such as grass, on all unpaved areas of street right-of-way or other public areas. All grassing shall be done to DOT specifications.
(5)
If at the end of the two-year warranty period the road or drainage structures are not in good maintenance, the county will require the developer/owner to make such repairs to bring the road or drainage structures into good maintenance. If after 60 days notice from the county the developer/owner has not made the required repairs, the county may seek to call the bond or other surety.
(c)
Utilities.
(1)
Generally. All water, sewer, natural gas lines and hydrants shall be along street rights-of-way. The water, sewer and natural gas lines shall be underground and located on back slopes of rights-of-way across drainage ditches away from pavements in order to prevent damage to the pavement during utility construction or maintenance. Only gravity-fed sewer lines may be placed under the pavement. Where required, because of topography, location of existing utilities or other factors, the director may allow the installation of utilities in other areas; however, the alternate location must be shown on the construction drawings and the as-built survey. Water and sewer lines must be on opposite sides of the street. Underground power lines must be located above and four feet to the side of either a water or sewer line.
(2)
Water. If a public or private water system is proposed to service the area of the subdivision within two years of the approval of the subdivision, water mains shall be installed by the subdivider within the subdivision with connections to each lot in each phase extended to the lot lines. If a public water system is available within 1,000 feet of either a residential or commercial development, a hookup to such is required. If a public or private water system is not available, the subdivider shall provide a water supply through a community water system or individual wells in conformity with the regulations of the county health department and this chapter.
(3)
Sewer. If a public sanitary sewer system is proposed to service the area of the subdivision within two years of the approval of the subdivision, sewer mains shall be installed by the subdivider within the subdivision with connections to each lot in each phase extended to the lot line. If a public sewer system is not available, the subdivider shall provide a community sewage collection and treatment system or individual septic tank systems in conformity with the regulations of the county health department and the state department of natural resources.
(4)
Fire hydrants (see chapter 32-19 of the Putnam County Code of Ordinances).
(d)
Storm drainage.
(1)
Design. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and lot drainage patterns for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots and any drainage feature must be capable of handling a 25-year storm event. Sensitive or high-risk areas will require handling larger storm events, which will be the responsibility of the designing engineer. Multifamily, commercial and industrial developments must take particular care in the design of the parking facilities and buildings with respect to the amount and direction of the runoff.
(2)
Design certification. A professional engineer must certify that the proposed storm drainage improvements and other proposed construction is adequate, complies with the requirements of this chapter, and complies with accepted engineering practice.
(3)
Connection to existing systems. If a storm system is located reasonably near the proposed development or subdivision, then the development or subdivision must contain an underground storm drainage system, which will be connected to the existing system. Should a storm drainage system not exist then adequate surface drainage facilities shall be installed. The professional engineer must ensure that the existing system is capable of accepting the additional stormwater without surcharging or damaging the existing system.
(4)
Stormwater management. Stormwater detention facilities or other forms of suitable storage features will be required where more than a five-percent increase in runoff occurs between the calculated pre-developed flows and the calculated post-developed flows. In addition, detention/retention facilities shall be required if the downstream facilities are not adequate to allow increased runoff. If the facility is deemed to be inadequate, the developer can request permission to modify (at his expense) the downstream facilities to allow a reduction in detention facilities as long as no downstream facilities or lands of others are harmed by the change. The maximum predevelopment rational method runoff coefficient ("C" factor) to be utilized while calculating flows shall be 0.25 for flat and rolling terrain and 0.30 for hilly (seven percent plus) terrain. Post development "C" factors to be utilized shall be related to the density of the development and amount of impervious area included in the development. All "C" factors shall be in accordance with accepted Rational Method Runoff Tables published. Calculations utilizing the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method of determining the runoff shall utilize the SCS soil group tables and covering to determine the SCS CN number to be used in the calculations. Calculations shall be shown for the two-, five-, ten-, and 25-year storm events. Emergency spillways shall be sized to handle a 100-year storm event. For pre-developed flows, the time of concentration (TOC) shall not be less than five minutes.
(5)
Roadside ditches. Front and back slopes for roadside ditches shall be 3:1 or flatter. Ditches shall be designed to handle at least a 25-year storm event and velocities within the ditch are recommended to be held below two feet per second. Velocities above two feet per second will require additional stabilization practices. Erosion matting meeting DOT specifications is recommended and may be required within any ditch. Check dams or other suitable structures shall be placed in accordance with the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition.
(6)
Drainage structures. Where drainage pipes, curb inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, and other structures are utilized, these shall conform to the Georgia DOT Standard Detail Manual, latest edition.
(7)
Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter meeting Georgia DOT Standard Detail Manual specifications is recommended for any new development. In residential areas, curb and gutter may either be 18 to 24-inch standup ("L" backing) or rollback type. In commercial and industrial areas, 30-inch standup is required. Associated junction boxes, piping, transitions, and other appurtenances shall meet Georgia DOT specifications.
(e)
Development along arterial or collector streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial or collector street or railroad right-of-way the following are required:
(1)
In a village, commercial or industrial-manufacturing zoning district of ten acres or more, the following shall apply: a two-lane access road parallel to the arterial or collector, separated from the arterial or collector by a ten-foot wide landscaped strip through which access shall be provided at intervals of no less than 500 feet or whenever coincident with a median break should one exist in the arterial or collector street shall be required.
(2)
In residential zoning districts (including multifamily), a 20-foot wide nonaccess buffer along the entire length of the back of the lots abutting an arterial or collector street is required.
(3)
Setbacks from arterial roads: 50 feet.
(f)
Lot sizes. All lots shall conform to the Putnam County Zoning Ordinance. The arrangement of the subdivision lots and design of the development and the required improvements, however, are controlled by this chapter.
(g)
* Lot lines. All subdivision side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless otherwise approved by the director in furtherance of creative design models.
(h)
* Double and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be required to provide separation of development from an arterial street or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(i)
Easements. The director of the planning and development department may require easements having an adequate width and located along rear and/or side lot lines for utility lines, drainage and underground cables, with provision for access from a public way. The director may also require access easements to existing parcels not otherwise fronting on a public road.
(j)
Reserve strips. Reserve strips that control access to street and public grounds shall be permitted only when the reserve strip is deeded to the county.
(k)
Deceleration lanes and center turn lanes.
(1)
Deceleration lanes or a center turn lane are required if sight distances required by this chapter cannot be achieved or the number of dwelling units in a development exceeds 50, at each entrance to a multifamily or nonresidential development project intersecting a county collector or a county arterial road, or if the director deems either a deceleration or turn lane or both are necessary to protect the safety of the public.
(2)
Deceleration and turn lane construction standards.
a.
Deceleration lanes shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control. The lane shall be 12 feet in width exclusive of the curb and gutter width. Additional right-of-way to accommodate the deceleration lane and a ten-foot shoulder shall be dedicated by the developer to the county.
b.
Left turn lanes may be required if the average daily traffic (ADT) exceeds 2,000 vehicles per day or if the director has knowledge of other information that would warrant a detailed traffic impact study as established by the Georgia Department of Transportation to determine if a left turn is needed. The study shall be prepared in accordance with the Georgia Department of Transportation Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control.
c.
Other project access improvements as deemed necessary by the director of the planning and development department in addition to a required deceleration lane in order to ensure adequate site access, pedestrian access, convenience, and safety to the motoring public may be required.
(l)
Minimum water main sizes. To allow for fire protection, all plans for development must meet all applicable fire protection codes. All water mains servicing any development shall be no less than eight inches in diameter.

Accel/decel lanes shall meet these requirements or match existing whichever is thickest.
(1)
Clearing and grubbing right-of-way. This work shall consist of removing and disposing of all vegetation and debris within the right-of-way to a depth of at least three feet below the existing grade for any fill sections and three feet below finished subgrade for any cut sections. Topsoil shall be stripped and stockpiled for later use. All stump holes shall be backfilled and compacted to 95 percent of the Standard Proctor density with a suitable material, Class I or II Soil.
(2)
Subgrade. This work shall consist of placing, mixing, compacting and shaping the top 24 inches of soil. This work also includes subgrade stabilization.
(3)
Compaction. The entire surface shall be plowed, harrowed and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be compacted at 98 percent of the Standard Proctor density. The appropriate roller for the soil to be compacted shall be used. Compaction tests shall be made by a certified engineer or from a certified laboratory. Tests are to be made along the roadbed at 500-foot intervals and at every two feet of fill. Any areas that do not meet with the specified compaction shall be excavated and replaced with suitable material. Test results shall be submitted to the director. The developer shall incur all costs for compaction tests. In addition, proof-rolling of the area shall be required consisting of a ten-ton payload on a standard tandem axle dump truck or other mutually agreed upon piece of loaded machinery, which shall be done in the presence of the public works department representative.
(4)
Subgrade material. All streets shall consist of Class I or II soil. If such material is not available on-site, it shall be furnished by the developer.

Suitable concrete paving is also acceptable for turnouts or curb cuts. Turnout/curb cuts serving single driveways shall have a minimum width after radius of 12 feet with commercial/industrial turnouts/curb cuts meeting requirements of subsection 28-65(h).
(4)
Commercial/Industrial entrance and lots. Due to the Americans with Disabilities Act, any and all ingress, egress, and parking lots/area including internal roads to and from, shall be paved by suitable conventional asphalt paving or concrete paving.
(h)
Shoulder requirements. The street right-of-way shall be graded to provide at least a five-foot gently sloping strip (sloped at approximately two percent away from the road) measured from the back of the curb or edge of the pavement on both sides of the street to provide utilities, to prevent the encroachment of driveways into the street surface, and to provide, however, that eight feet shall be provided for walkways off the paved vehicular surface; provided, however, that the director of the planning and development department may waive this requirement in cases where the subdivider can demonstrate that the topography of the land being subdivided is such that compliance with this section would be impractical. Topsoil, striped and stockpiled before paving, shall be spread at a minimum depth of four inches in preparation of the seedbed. The soil shall be thoroughly broken, well pulverized, smoothed and firm before planting. The shoulder shall be seeded with tall fescue and Bermuda applied at a rate of 40 pounds per acre. Mulch shall be used on all seeded areas. The mulch material may consist of rye, oat or wheat straw of good quality, free of seeds of competing species.

All cross drainpipes for multifamily driveways shall be fully bituminous-coated corrugated metal pipe with the appropriate bedding, inlet/outlet protection, and headwalls/flared-end sections. Installations shall be in accordance with state DOT standards. A hydrology study with pre- and post-development flows and routing computations shall be submitted with the design. Pipe gauge (thickness) shall be as determined by the height of the fill. Minimum cover pipes shall be 12 inches. HDPE (hydro polyethylene) pipe with smooth inside lining may be substituted for the CMP (corrugated metal pipe) if adequate cover can be achieved in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Reinforced concrete (RC) pipe is required under county arterials and county collectors and local streets. Multibarrel culverts are permitted if single barrel pipe installations cannot adequately provide the flow capacity and achieve cover over the pipe.
(j)
Design standards for cul-de-sacs. Except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable, as determined by the director, cul-de-sacs (dead-end streets) should not be greater than 1,200 feet in length measured from the nearest (existing or proposed) intersection. It is recommended that they be not greater than 500 feet in length in multifamily areas. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least 60 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet for residential developments and a 70-foot property line radius with an outside pavement radius of 50 feet for commercial and industrial developments. Temporary paved turnarounds are required at the end of any roadway of each phase until the next phase of the development is initiated.
