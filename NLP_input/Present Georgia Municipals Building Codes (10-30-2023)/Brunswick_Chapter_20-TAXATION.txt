ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 20-1. - Administration.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk, as ex-officio tax commissioner, shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection, and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in this article. The city clerk shall be assisted by the finance director and the city marshal, who shall have specific responsibilities set forth hereinafter. In any case where this article does not specifically provide a procedure, said officers shall act in the manner established for the collection of state and county taxes under applicable state law.
(b)
In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes, as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-352.
(c)
Following adoption of the budget for each fiscal year, the city commission shall adopt a resolution setting the millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed for the current tax year. Prior to adoption of the mileage rate, the commission shall publish notice of the proposed ad valorem tax rate, as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied.
(d)
The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon to assure delivery; provided, however, that failure of the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), the net amount of tax due thereon, and the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill shall also state such other information as may be required by law, including the information required by O.C.G.A. § 48-8-91 with respect to proceeds of the local option sales tax if applicable.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-2. - Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes.
(a)
All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, or on such date as the commission shall establish, not less than 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date specified in the ordinance or resolution imposing the tax or assessments.
(b)
All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance, no partial payments shall be accepted.
(c)
Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in statistical release H. 15 or any publication that may supersede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of statistical release H. 15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall begin to accrue from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk shall be authorized to waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that the clerk reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to action or inaction of the clerk's office.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999; Ord. No. 1054, § 1, 3-7-2018)
Sec. 20-3. - Penalties.
(a)
All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article.
(b)
In any instance in which any taxpayer willfully fails to pay a tax or assessment within 120 days of the due date, such person shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. After 120 days from the imposition of the initial penalty, an additional penalty of five percent of any tax amount remaining due shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. If any tax amount remains due after 120 days from the imposition of such additional penalty, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. Should any tax amount remain due 120 days after such date, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. The aggregate amount of penalties imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to 20 percent of the principal amount of the tax originally due.
(c)
The city commission may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent that said body finds and determines that the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999; Ord. No. 1054, § 1, 3-7-2018)
Sec. 20-4. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments.
(a)
After the last day for payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days an execution shall be issued.
(b)
The city clerk shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) above. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi.fa. (taxpayer), the tax year(s) for which the execution is issued and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular the sheriffs and constables of the state."
(c)
The city clerk shall cause all executions issued for delinquent taxes on real property to be recorded on the general execution docket in the county prior to any tax sale. All executions issued for delinquent taxes on personal property or special assessments shall be recorded on the general execution docket in any county where any property of the taxpayer can be found.
(d)
All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for delinquent taxes and assessments.
(e)
The city clerk shall cause all executions to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi.fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the property of the defendant in fi.fa., whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-5. - Levy of executions; sale of property.
(a)
The chief of police is hereby designated as the marshal of the city, and he and any deputy marshal designated by him shall be responsible for carrying out the duties specified in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the city clerk. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on any process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi.fa.
(b)
In all cases of levying on real property, written notice of the levy shall be given to the defendant in fi.fa. and to any tenants in possession personally or by certified mail within five days of the levy. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi.fa. therein.
(c)
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the duty of the marshal, before proceeding to advertise the property for sale, to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk.
(d)
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi.fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e)
The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the tax year(s) for which execution has been issued.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal at City Hall, in the meeting room of the city commission, on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale nor the city may make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
(g)
The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash, and upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi.fa or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
(h)
Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property to be sold for taxes after the property has been offered for a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-6. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired.
(a)
If during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager or his designee may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 20-9 of this article.
(c)
The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 20-9 of this article.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-7. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement.
(a)
The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the city clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess.
(b)
In any event, if, within 90 days form the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectible in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing.
(c)
It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket upon their final payment or collection.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-8. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment.
(a)
Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi.fa on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to the effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi.fa or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi.fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
(b)
When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of nulla bona has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi.fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi.fa maintains, place of business or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi.fa does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county, where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. ch. 48-3.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-9. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi.fa.; vesting of title in grantee.
(a)
Whenever real property is sold by non-judicial sale for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the non-judicial sale until the right of redemption is foreclosed by giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which code sections are incorporated herein by reference as a part of this article.
(b)
Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a non-judicial tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) above, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed, provided the defendant in fi.fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi.fa is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-10. - Costs.
(a)
For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi.fa.
(b)
Once a levy is made or posed on the property of a defendant in fi.fa, in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00.
(c)
In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorneys' fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00.
(d)
The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as part of the redemption price.
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999)
Sec. 20-11. - Judicial in rem tax foreclosure proceedings.
(a)
In addition to the non-judicial tax sales authorized by section 20-5 above, the city clerk, with the assistance of the city attorney, is hereby authorized to proceed with judicial in rem tax foreclosure proceedings in the county superior court in accordance with the terms of O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4, art. 5 and by resolution of the city commission dated February 3, 1999.
(b)
