ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 6-1. - Necessity of regulations.
In accordance with the laws of the state, it is necessary and expedient for the county to exercise its police powers to establish and promulgate certain standards and regulations in regard to the sale, tax and control of packaged malt beverages and/or wine, as well as the sale for consumption on the premises of malt beverages and/or wine, in the unincorporated areas of the county. The business of manufacturing, distributing, selling, handling, and otherwise dealing in or possessing malt beverages and/or wine, as well as the business of selling malt beverages and/or wine for consumption on the premises, is declared to be a privilege, not a right, and such privilege shall not be exercised in the county except as licensed under the terms of this chapter. This chapter does not permit the sale of distilled spirits by the drink or otherwise for consumption on the premises. Such sale of distilled spirits by the drink or otherwise for consumption on the premises is expressly prohibited. This chapter does not permit the sale of any alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises of the licensee. Licensing shall be solely for the unincorporated areas of the county.
