(A)
Notice, hearing. Any license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the county to any licensee may be denied, suspended or revoked by the Clay County Board of Commissioners for due cause. Before the Board of Commissioners shall deny any application for a license or shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the County Clerk to show cause before the Board of Commissioners at a time and place specified therein not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice, why the application for, or renewal of, a license should not be denied, or why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefore, and at the appointed time and place the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exist, why the applicant should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the Board of Commissioners shall take such action as it, in its judgment, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice.

In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney and have testimony recorded at his or her expense.
(B)
Due cause generally.
(1)
Due cause for the suspension, revocation or denial of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the Board of Commissioner, after a hearing as above provided, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business or for the violation of any state or federal law, breach of peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring on or inside the premises or for the violation any county ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances.
(2)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof or the owner or any person connected therewith ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter.
(3)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original or renewal application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(4)
Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the Board of Commissioners, after proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the alcoholic beverage license for such establishment or the denial of renewal application for same.
(C)
Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with peace officers acting in line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or employee hereunder to cooperate with any peace officer or on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all legal powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the Sheriff shall immediately order all sales of any alcoholic beverages suspended until after a hearing as set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (A) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(D)
Terms of suspension for first offense. Upon presentation of reasonable evidence to show cause for revoking or suspending of a license, the Board of Commissioners shall revoke or suspend said license for such period of time as provided herein for the first offense:
(1)
Breach of peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring on or in the premises or for the violation of any state or federal law, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, prostitution, gambling or failure or refusal to cooperate with peace officers acting in the line of duty: 30 days;

(E)
Terms of suspension for second offense. The revocation or suspension shall be twice the term of the first offence if revoked or suspended for a second violation. Upon a second violation, the licensee shall install or cause to be installed a video monitoring and recording system of the type and number approved by the Sheriff.
(1)
Such video monitoring and recording systems shall be capable of recording time, and the recording medium used shall be of a quality capable of being reproduced onto a still frame.

(G)
Effect of revocation by state. Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell any alcoholic beverage at retail, the county license to deal in such thereupon shall be automatically revoked without any action by the Board of Commissioners or any law enforcement officer. If the state has suspended the license or placed the same on probation, then the county license is automatically suspended or probated, as the case may be.
(H)
Emergency situation. The Chairperson of the Clay County Board of Commissioners is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in any emergency situation, and the suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the Board of Commissioners. In addition, in any emergency situation, the Sheriff is authorized to cause the business in question to close temporarily until he or she decides the emergency or possible riotous situation to be at an end, or until such decision is made by the Board of Commissioners at its next regular meeting, whichever occurs first.
