This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Fayette County Sign Ordinance."

Sec. 108-2. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The board of commissioners of the county understands that signs are an integral part of the ability of every person to exercise their right to freedom of speech. It is, however, important to understand that there is a fundamental need to protect the county as a whole from the unchecked proliferation of unregulated signage. It is with this understanding in mind that the board of commissioners of the county provides the following purposes for the regulation of signage:
(1)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the unincorporated county;
(2)
To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the county's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth;
(3)
To improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
(4)
To minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and
(5)
To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions.
(b)
This sign chapter is adopted under the zoning authority of the county in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in chapter 110, zoning.

Should the process exceed 45 days, it shall be deemed that the application is approved and the zoning administrator shall issue a permit to the applicant.
