B.
Submission of application for R-6 approval:
1.
The applicant must file an application with the administrative officer for approval of the proposed R-6 development. This application must be supported by a site development plan and a written plan of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. Eight (8) copies of the site development plan and written plan of intent must accompany the application. The site development plan shall consist of a series of drawings which must show the following:
a.
A general location map.
b.
The site development plan shall be drawn at a scale suitable to show the extent of the proposed development. North arrow and correct scale will be shown on all drawings. Scales of 1″=100′ are acceptable.

b.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.

Review and approval of R-6 application:
1.
An application for approval of R-6 zoning is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because R-6 districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed R-6 development. Upon approval of the R-6 zoning, existing zoning must be changed to an R-6 zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in sections 414 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the R-6 development. Approval of R-6 zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.
2.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the R-6 district (section 2302). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
3.
The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer.
4.
No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners.
D.
Issuance of building permits: The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See: Section 408.)
E.
Revision of development plan after approval of plan:
1.
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval of the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 2302. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
