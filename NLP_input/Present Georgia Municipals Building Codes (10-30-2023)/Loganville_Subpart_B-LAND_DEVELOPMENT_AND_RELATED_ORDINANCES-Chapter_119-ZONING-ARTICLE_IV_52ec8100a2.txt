The provisions of this section apply to the PUV planned urban village district.
(2)
The planned urban village (PUV) district is intended to encourage and accommodate high-quality, pedestrian oriented, unified design and combinations of retail, cultural, public and residential uses and facilities in accordance with an approved master plan. The district allows for flexibility and encourages creative, efficient and aesthetically desirable design and placement of buildings, open spaces, circulation patterns and parking facilities in order to best utilize special site features of topography, size or shape.
(3)
The PUV district is intended to:
a.
Promote more efficient and economic uses of land while respecting historic context and landscape features.
b.
Encourage land uses that reduce transportation need and that conserve energy and natural resources to the maximum extent possible.
c.
Encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment with emphasis on street level commercial and/or cultural activities.
d.
Encourage, cultural, retail and residential uses in a mixed-use, urban setting with uses in close proximity to maximize opportunities for pedestrian traffic, thereby reducing the need for automobile dependency and demand for parking.
e.
Preserve, to the greatest extent possible, and incorporate in harmonious fashion, mature trees and unique topographic and hydrologic features of the site.
f.
Create an atmosphere with wide sidewalks and associated public spaces and amenities, providing access to a variety of commercial, civic, residential, recreational and pedestrian uses and activities.
(b)
Applicability; eligibility. Properties proposed for designation as a PUV shall contain a minimum of 20 acres but in no case shall be larger than 250 acres. The proposed site must have a minimum of 100 feet of frontage on and access to at least one arterial or major collector road as classified by the City of Loganville.
(c)
Unified control/ownership. All land included for the purpose of development within a planned urban village district shall be owned by or under the complete control of the applicant for such zoning designation, whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, or other entity, group or agency. Unified control shall be maintained throughout the development and construction of all phases of the project. For purposes of this paragraph, the meaning of complete control shall include land use regulations, operational limitations, architectural design standards, mandatory reviews of plans, such as architectural elevations, site plans, or landscape designs, and/or other regulations or operational controls established in a declaration of covenants, property owners association, or other similar instrument.
(d)
Detailed master plan required.
(1)
Development in this district requires approval by the mayor and city council of a detailed master plan that shall become a condition of zoning approval. All development shall be in substantial conformance to the approved master plan. Substantial deviations from or modifications to the approved master plan, as determined by the director of planning and development, shall require mayor and city council approval.
a.

(2)
Building permit concurrency:
a.
Building permits in the PUV zoning classification will be issued in 25 percent increments of the total amount of proposed development of each of the three types of structures allowed in this classification (i.e., 25 percent of the total proposed commercial development; 25 percent of the total proposed single-family dwellings; and 25 percent of the total proposed townhomes). No additional building permits shall be issued until the previously permitted 25 percent of each type of structure has been fully completed and a certificate of occupancy has been issued for all of the structures subject to the previous permit. At that time, the developer may apply for a permit to build the next 25 percent of the total amount of proposed development of each of the three types of structures. Once the certificates of occupancy have been issued for that second 25 percent, the developer may apply to develop the next 25 percent of the total amount of proposed development of each of the three types of structures. This procedure shall apply for each 25 percent of the total proposed development until 100 percent of the development has been permitted. No building permit will be issued pursuant to this subsection unless and until certificates of occupancy have been issued for any and all structures that were previously permitted.
