(Ord. No. 1-94, § 1-15, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-54. - Main motion.
In order for the city council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-01, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-55. - Debate.
(a)
After the main motion is recognized by the mayor, the city council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all councilmembers. Councilmembers can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor.
(b)
During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion (section 2-58). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated.
(c)
Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-59). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-02, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-56. - Voting procedure.
Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways:
a.
If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the mayor can call for the vote; and if there are no objections, the mayor can proceed with the vote.
b.
If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a councilmember may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by at least three councilmembers, the debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the city council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers.
(2)
Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the mayor. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-03, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-57. - Ranking of motions.
(a)
Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion for lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the city council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence.
(b)
A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list.
LOWEST RANK:
a.
Main motion.
Subsidiary motions (debatable):
b.
Postpone indefinitely.
c.

d.
Refer to committee (commit).
e.
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely).
Subsidiary motions (undebatable):

g.
Vote immediately (previous question).
h.
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
Privileged motions (undebatable):
i.
Question of privilege.

HIGHEST RANK:

Adjourn.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-04, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-58. - Subsidiary motions.
During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the city council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions, and they allow the city council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate, and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. The concurrence of at least three councilmembers shall be required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend.
a.
If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain, and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times.
b.
Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. If the amendment is adopted, the council shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a councilmember believes that further information is needed before the council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date the committee or department will report back to the council. This motion is debatable and amendable.
(4)
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-05, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-59. - Privileged motions.
Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the mayor concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The mayor is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended.
(3)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-06, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-60. - Incidental motions.
Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their rights as a member of the city council. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(1)
Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the mayor, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The mayor has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The council shall decide if the mayor's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(2)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the mayor to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(3)
Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can make a ruling on the question. However, if the council so chooses, it can debate the issue and overrule the holding of the mayor. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(4)
Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the mayor and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required, and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-07, 10-24-1994)
Sec. 2-61. - Supplementary main motions.
Three motions allow the city council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified.
(1)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember can make a motion to reconsider, and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided; and the council will return to debate and revote the original motion.
(2)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, the mayor and councilmember shall debate and vote on rescission. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(3)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion.

(Ord. No. 2019-27, 8-12-2019)
Sec. 2-97 - Centralized purchasing and procurement methods.
(a)
Centralized purchasing. It shall be the policy of the city to maintain a centralized purchasing process with the purchasing agent. It shall be the purchasing agent's responsibility to administer purchasing policies, institute reports necessary to permit analysis or purchasing performance, negotiate and approve term contracts in concert with city departments, consolidate purchases of like or common items, analyze prices paid for materials and equipment, and generally define how to obtain savings and to coordinate purchasing procedures.
(b)
Budget allocation and control. Unless a budget appropriation is available, no procurement will occur which obligates the city to pay for goods or services. Each respective department head or designee has the responsibility of reviewing the budget availability prior to beginning the ordering of goods or services.
(c)
Procurement thresholds. Policy pertaining to the amount of a purchase determines how the purchase will be handled. Listed are general minimums for quotes, bids, and proposal guidelines for goods and services. These thresholds apply to aggregate purchases. For example, purchase 10,000 screws for $1.00 each, the aggregate price is $10,000.00, not the individual price of $1.00. Purchase orders may not be split to avoid following these threshold requirements. The finance department will strictly monitor these requirements.
(1)
Up to $999.99—Department director;
(2)
$1,000.00—$2,499.99—Finance director;
(3)
$2,500.00—$4,999.99—City manager; and
(4)
$5,000.00 and over—Mayor and city council.
The mayor and city council must approve all invoices over $5,000.00 before payment may be issued.
(d)
Methods of procurement. All purchases of, and contracts for, supplies and contractual services shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be based on three or more bids. In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used.
(1)
Competitive sealed bid (ITB). In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
a.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.
b.
Two or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process.
c.
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $50,000.00.
d.
Revenue is greater than $50,000.00.
(2)
Competitive sealed proposal (RFP). When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
a.
Whether quality, availability or capacity is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services.
b.
Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest.
c.
Whether a fixed price or a cost type contract is more advantageous.
d.
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
e.
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $50,000.00.
f.
Revenue is greater than $50,000.00.
(3)
Informal purchase. Those purchases $25,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduction of competitive sealed bids or proposals. Such purchases will be obtained competitively as follows:
a.
Up to $999.99: Department directors are granted the authority to handle purchases where the cost is less than $1,000.00.
b.
$1,000.00—$4,999.99: The purchasing agent shall obtain goods and services competitively through telephone solicitations where the cost is greater than $1,000.00 but less than $5,000.00. A minimum of three quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available.
c.
$5,000.00—$49,999.00 The purchasing agent shall obtain goods and services competitively through written quotations where the cost is $5,000.00 to $49,999.99. A minimum of three written quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available.
(4)
Sole source purchase. A contract may be awarded or a purchase made without competition when the city determines that there is only one source for the required products, supply service, or construction item. The purchasing agent shall conduct negotiations as appropriate, as to price, delivery, and terms. A separate file of sole source procurements shall be maintained as public record and shall list each contractor's name, the amount and type of each contract, and a listing of the item(s) procured under each purchase order/contract.
(5)
Emergency purchase. An emergency exists when there is a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of people or property, or when there is a material disruption of goods or services. The competitive process should be followed whenever possible in an emergency as long as the ability to respond to the emergency is not seriously impaired. All emergencies where cost is greater than $5,000.00 require ratification of the mayor and city council.
(6)
Cooperative purchase. The purchasing agent may elect to purchase products or services through a cooperative purchasing process authorized by any intergovernmental agreement with other units of government. The process provides discounting through combining the "purchasing power" of local entities to achieve economies of scale associated with this type of relationship.
(7)
State contract or other governmental contract use. The purchasing agent may use an approved State of Georgia contract or other competitively bid governmental contract for purchasing any products or services that are available to local governments.
(e)
Purchase orders. Purchase orders shall be required for all purchases; however, no purchase orders shall be required for budgeted regularly recurring expenses, such as utility bills. Purchase orders shall be authorized under the same thresholds provided in section 2-96(c).
(f)
Modification of specifications. Once a contract is bid and awarded by city officials in accordance with this section, the city reserves the right to further negotiate all terms of the contract if the city determines that is in the city's best interest to do so without the necessity of re-bidding any such contract; provided, however, that any negotiations permitted hereunder shall not result in a variance of the price term exceeding ten percent of the original price.
(g)
Change orders. Change orders within the current budget shall be authorized by the city manager up to $5,000.00. A report must be provided to the mayor and city council. Change orders exceeding the current budget and/or above $5,000.00 shall require approval by the city council.
(h)
Disposition of personal property. The mayor and city council shall determine whether a particular item or category of personal property can no longer be used advantageously by the city and has therefore become unserviceable. Unserviceable personal property having a value of $500.00 or greater shall be sold in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-37-6 to the highest responsible bidder, either by sealed bids or by auction after due notice has been given. The mayor and council shall have the right to reject any and all bids or to cancel any proposed sale. The city shall cause notice to be published once in the official legal organ of the county or in a newspaper of general circulation in the community, not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days preceding the day of the auction or, if the sale is by sealed bids, preceding the last day for the receipt of proposals. The legal notice shall include a general description of the personal property to be sold. If the sale is by sealed bids, the notice shall also contain an invitation for proposals and shall state the conditions of the proposed sale, the address at which bid blanks and other written materials connected with the proposed sale may be obtained, and the date, time, and place for the opening of bids. If the sale is by auction, the notice shall also contain the conditions of the proposed sale and shall state the date, time, and place of the proposed sale. Bids received in connection with a sale by sealed bidding shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the legal notice. A tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection following the opening of all bids. All such bids shall be retained and kept available for public inspection for a period of not less than 60 days from the date on which such bids are opened. Personal property having a value of less than $500.00 may be sold on the open market without the necessity of advertisement or public bid.
(i)
Disposition of real property. All dispositions of municipal real property shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 37-36-7, and other applicable statutes in accordance with the character of the real property.
(j)
Conflict of interest. All officials and employees of the city shall avoid conflict of interest in procurement. A conflict of interest arises when a purchase of goods or services would result in the official or employee, or any member of the official or employee's family, directly or indirectly realizing a financial gain. In such situations, the affected official or employee shall refrain from any participation in the procurement activity or decision making.
(k)
Purchases in violation. Any purchase of a good or service made in violation of this section by any person shall be null and void and shall not be binding upon the city or any department or committee of the city.
(l)
Conflicting provisions. All sections or parts of this section in conflict with this section are hereby repealed in their entirety.

(a)
Any person having a complaint against any member of the governing authority for an alleged ethics violation shall file in writing a verified complaint setting forth the particular facts and circumstances which constitute the alleged violation. The complaint shall be filed with the city manager or city attorney. Upon receipt of a complaint the city manager or city attorney shall randomly draw the names of three members from the board of ethics pool. The three members along with the city attorney as legal counsel, shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. The investigating committee shall have the right to request supporting documentation from the complaining party if the committee deems it reasonable to avoid the pursuit of frivolous complaints. If the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous or patently unfounded, it shall be dismissed and the complainant notified immediately. If the complaint is found to state sufficient facts to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, the board shall be appointed as provided in subsection (b).
(b)
The board of ethics of the city shall be composed of seven registered voters of the city to be appointed as provided in this subsection. Each member of the board of ethics shall have been a resident of the city for at least one year immediately preceding the date of taking office and shall remain a resident of the city while serving as a member of the board of ethics. No person shall serve as a member of the board of ethics if the person has, or has had within the preceding one-year period, any interest in any contract, transaction or official action of the city.

The city attorney shall maintain a listing of these 18 qualified registered voters of the city. Should the investigating committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the first public meeting after such determination, shall draw names randomly from the listing of qualified citizens until the specified seven members of the board of ethics have been appointed. Such board will elect one of its members to serve as chairman.
The governing authority of the city shall provide a meeting space for the board of ethics. Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities.
