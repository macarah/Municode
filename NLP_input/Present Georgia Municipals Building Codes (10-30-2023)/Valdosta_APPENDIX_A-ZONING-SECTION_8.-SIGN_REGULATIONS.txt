SECTION 8. - SIGN REGULATIONS

8-1. - Purpose and Intent.
8-1.1. In General. The regulation of location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the City of Valdosta without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Signs are recognized as a development standard in keeping with other development standards such as uses permitted, building setbacks, minimum parking requirements, minimum lot size, minimum landscaping, maximum unit density, etc. It is therefore the intention of the City of Valdosta to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will:
A.
Promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B.
Enhance the economy, business, and industry of the City by promoting reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
C.
Restrict signs and lights which increase visual clutter, or increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision or creating undue visual distraction.
D.
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings in terms of zoning, existing land use, and architectural characteristics.
As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signs and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider:
1.
The character of the proposed sign and the audience for which the sign is designed. The applicant is urged to think not only of the sign itself, but also the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area.
2.
The character of the sign structure; that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element.
Before applying for a permit or erecting an exempted sign, anyone contemplating a sign is also encouraged to contact the Building Inspector's office of the City of Valdosta and/or a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice or assistance in planning a sign.
8-1.2. Jurisdiction. This ordinance shall apply to all properties located within the corporate limits of Valdosta, Georgia. This ordinance shall not relate to the copy or message on athletic field scoreboards, official signs of any government, gravestones, commemorative plaques, or display of construction not defined herein as a sign.
8-1.3. Applicability of Other Code Requirements.
(a)
All signs and other advertising structures shall be constructed and/or maintained in strict conformity with the building and electrical codes adopted by the City of Valdosta.
(b)
If any provisions or requirements of this ordinance are found to be in conflict with any other provision or requirement of this ordinance or of any other applicable governmental law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or other governmental regulation of any kind, the more restrictive rule or standard shall take precedence.
8-1.4. Variances. Variances from the provisions of this ordinance may be requested. All such variances shall be considered and decided by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with officially adopted procedures and standards contained in the City of Valdosta Zoning Ordinance. Granting of a variance shall not establish precedence in the consideration of any other variance request.

The area shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(2)
Area of Multifaced Signs. The area shall be computed by adding together the area of all individual sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 36 inches apart, the two faces shall be considered one sign and the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)
Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign or sign structure, whichever is higher. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
8-4.6. Sign Setbacks.
(a)
Unless otherwise provided, no freestanding or portable sign at its nearest point shall be closer than five feet (vertical line ground distance) from a street right-of-way line or property line.
(b)
All freestanding signs containing copy area between a height of three feet and nine feet above ground shall be located a minimum of 20 feet from the intersection of two street right-of-way lines, or the intersection of a street right-of-way line with a driveway pavement edge. Sign supports in excess of two feet in diameter or which cumulatively provides less than 70 percent visibility, shall be subject to this same setback requirement.

Banner displayed 60 days; banner removed 30 days.
