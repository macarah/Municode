(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.7. - Injunctive relief.
When the county finds that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition one or more courts of Forsyth County through the county attorney for the issuance of temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate. Said temporary or permanent injunction shall, as appropriate, restrain the violation and/or compel the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, order, or other applicable requirement. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any user or person. The Georgia EPD shall have authority to seek judicial relief and may also use administrative penalty authority to enforce these ordinances or any other applicable provision of law when the POTW has sought a relief which the Georgia EPD believes to be insufficient.
