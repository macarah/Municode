Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code of Ordinances of Lee County, in the event that the county planning and zoning department receives an application for a building or other permit for the construction of a commercial building in the unincorporated areas of Lee County where the proposed commercial building is located at the intersection of a state highway or county road and a federal highway which federal highway consists of at least two lanes of traffic in each direction, the planning and zoning department shall review the permit request and submit it, along with a written report of the results of such review, to the board of commissioners for final review and approval or denial of the requested permit or permits. The planning and zoning department may, but shall not be required to, recommend approval or denial of such permit request at the time the written report is submitted to the board of commissioners. In undertaking such review, the board of commissioners shall consider the following criteria:
(1)
Whether there are State of Georgia approved, owned and operated traffic-control devices at such intersection which provide traffic control as to all roads and highways constituting the intersection through the use of red, green, and yellow lights, but which are not flashing circular red lights or flashing circular yellow lights; and

Whether the commercial business or businesses to be located in the commercial buildings at such an intersection are projected to have an average traffic count of more than 50 vehicles entering or leaving the property where such commercial buildings are located and flowing onto either the state highway, the county road, or the federal four-lane highway which constitute such intersection from such commercial property. The determination of the projected average traffic count accessing and leaving the property where the commercial building is located on a daily basis shall be as determined by the Lee County Planning and Development Department as part of its review of the permit application.
(3)
Whether the proposed commercial development, and the type of business to be operated at such location after the completion of the construction of such commercial development, will likely pose safety hazards to the public as a result of increased traffic at such intersection;

Whether the proposed commercial development, and the type of business to be operated at such location after the completion of the construction of such commercial development, will likely result in the normal flow of traffic at such intersection being impeded upon a regular basis;
(5)
Whether the type of commercial business to be operated at such intersection, when taking into account the types of commercial businesses already being operated such intersection and the immediate area of such intersection, will result in an increased traffic volume that will significantly exceed the normal traffic volume at such intersection as it existed prior to the construction and operation of the new commercial business;
(6)
Whether the proximity of residential dwellings or residential subdivisions in the immediate area of the proposed commercial development will have a significant negative impact specifically upon the safety of children being transported by school buses to and from local schools
(7)
Whether there are any additional public health or public safety situations likely to occur on a regular basis at such intersection, or in the area of such intersection, resulting from the location of the particular proposed commercial development, or resulting from the location of the type of business to be operated at such location after the completion of the construction of such commercial development, which would negatively impact the health and safety of the public.
