ARTICLE I. - SIGN ORDINANCE

Sec. 13-1. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "Gordon County Sign Ordinance."
(Ord. of 2-22-2000, § I)
Sec. 13-2. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The intent of this article is to provide for the regulation of outdoor advertising signs, which are erected on and visible from the road system of Gordon County, Georgia. A sign by its very nature is designed to draw an individual's attention to that sign. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication. However, this same characteristic can distract motorists and pedestrians and thus create traffic hazards. In addition, the clutter created by an excess in number, size and height of signs creates a distraction to travelers and negatively impacts the general appearance of an area. Signs lessen the aesthetic qualities of an area and intrude upon the residential character of an area. Therefore, signs must be regulated to insure that they are structurally safe and sound and free of all hazards and to limit the negative impact of signs while encouraging the positive and constructive uses of signs.
The purposes of this article are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication within Gordon County; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and Gordon County's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to protect the public traveling along primary and interstate highways from distractions, from aesthetic desecration and from nuisances and all associated with the proliferation of signs in a concentrated area along said highways; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; to regulate signs by zoning district, size, height, location on a lot, number, methods of visitors and businesses within Gordon County.
(b)
This article is not intended, and shall not be applied in any manner, to control the message or content of the message on any sign allowed under this article and the laws of the State of Georgia. This article is intended to regulate signs in the unincorporated areas of Gordon County while showing full deference to the right to engage in constitutionally protected speech.
(c)
Nothing in this article shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power or duty in conflict with the preemptive effect of any federal or state law.
(d)
Nothing in this article shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any liability on Gordon County, its employees, agents, or officials which enforce or fail to enforce any of the provisions provided herein or any applicable provisions of state law.
