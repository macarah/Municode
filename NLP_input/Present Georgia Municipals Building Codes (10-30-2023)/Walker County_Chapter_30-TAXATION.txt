ARTICLE VII. - VEHICLES

Sec. 30-174. - Legislative findings.
The Board of Commissioners makes the following findings with respect to this article:
(1)
State law requires that residents register and license their motor vehicles, tractors, motorcycles and trailers (collectively referred to in this article by the term "motor vehicles") within 30 days after becoming residents of this State. Further, each resident is required to register and license their motor vehicles within 30 days after the purchase, rental or lease of the motor vehicles.
(2)
The Board of Commissioners finds that many bona fide residents of the County have moved here from other states and at the time they became residents of the County, their motor vehicles are registered and licensed in the State from which they have moved.
(3)
Motor vehicles are subject to ad valorem taxes in this State, which said taxes help to directly fund the schools and County government.
(4)
The Board of Commissioners finds that numerous residents of the County have failed to register their motor vehicles in the State within 30 days after becoming residents of the County.
(5)
The Board of Commissioners finds that other residents of the County have registered their new or used motor vehicles in other states to avoid paying ad valorem tax.
(6)
The Board of Commissioners finds that the failure of these individuals to register their motor vehicles and pay the ad valorem tax on these motor vehicles puts an undue tax burden on the other taxpaying citizens of the County.
(7)
The Board of Commissioners finds that, under O.C.G.A. § 40-2-8(a), any person operating a motor vehicle described in O.C.G.A. § 40-2-20 upon any public highway or street without complying with O.C.G.A. § 40-2-20 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor under State law, and that this provision applies to a person who becomes a resident of this State and fails to register his motor vehicle within 30 days after becoming a resident of this State.
(8)
The Board of Commissioners finds that the provisions of general law are being evaded because operation of an unregistered motor vehicle without proper registration is a moving offense and, therefore, the motor vehicle must be operated on the public streets or roads in order to be cited for a violation. Because of the County's proximity to Alabama and Tennessee, this makes enforcement of moving violations difficult. The Board of Commissioners desires to provide for local enforcement of this article, which makes it a violation of this Code to fail to register a motor vehicle in the County within 30 days after becoming a resident of this State or for residents to fail to register and license their motor vehicles within 30 days after purchase, rent or lease of the motor vehicle.
(9)
The Board of Commissioners finds that the Sheriff, County Police, or County Code Enforcement Officers should enforce this article by issuing a County citation to every resident who fails to register his motor vehicle within 30 days after becoming a resident of this State or within 30 days after acquiring the motor vehicle.
(Code 2005, § 54-71)
Sec. 30-175. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Motor vehicle means a motor vehicle, tractor, motorcycle or trailer which is required to be registered and licensed under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-2-8 and 40-2-20.
Resident means a person who has a permanent home or abode in the County, to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning. For purposes of this article, there is a rebuttable presumption that any person who, except for infrequent, brief absences, has been present in the County for 30 days or more is a resident.
(Code 2005, § 54-72; Ord. of 5-2-2001, § I)
Sec. 30-176. - Registration required.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any resident who owns, rents or leases a motor vehicle to fail to register his motor vehicle in this State, as required under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-2-8 and 40-2-20, within 30 days after becoming a resident.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any resident who purchases, rents or leases a new or used motor vehicle to fail to register his motor vehicle in this State, as required under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-2-8 and 40-2-20, within 30 days after acquiring the motor vehicle.
