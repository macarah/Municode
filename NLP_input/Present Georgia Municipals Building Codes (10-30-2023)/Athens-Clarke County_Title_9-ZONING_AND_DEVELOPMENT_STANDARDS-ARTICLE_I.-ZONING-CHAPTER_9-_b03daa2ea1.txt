Sec. 9-3-3. - Official zoning map.
A.
The following maps are adopted contemporaneously with the text of this title and shall be considered an integral part of this title:
1.
The location and boundaries of the districts designated in Section 9-3-2 and the design areas for the C-D district designated in section 9-10-6 are established as shown on the map entitled the "Official Zoning Map of Athens-Clarke County" (hereinafter referred to as the "zoning map"), dated as of the adoption date of this ordinance, July 2, 2019, and signed by the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Clerk of Commission, with the following certification: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in the Zoning Ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. Pursuant to section 9-3-7 of such ordinance, this map supersedes the Official Zoning Map adopted February 4, 2014 and certified February 6, 2014." Said map is made a part of this title by reference and incorporation as if fully set forth herein.
2.
Future Development Map, adopted on July 3, 2018, as an integral component of the Athens-Clarke County Comprehensive Plan, and signed by the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Clerk of Commission, with the following certification: "This is to certify that this is the Official Future Land Use Map of Athens-Clarke County referred to and incorporated in the Zoning Ordinance of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia." This map supersedes the Official Future Development Map adopted February 4, 2014, and certified February 6, 2014. Said map is made a part of the Athens-Clarke County Comprehensive Plan by reference herein and a part of Title 9 of the Code of Athens-Clarke County by reference and incorporation as if fully set forth herein.
B.
The signed originals of said maps shall be maintained on file in the office of the clerk of the Athens-Clarke County Commission and, by reference, are made a part of this title as if fully incorporated herein.
C.
Exemplified copies of said maps may also be maintained in the office of the Athens-Clarke County Planning Department for public inspection. Distribution copies shall be available for sale in the planning department at such cost as from time to time established by resolution of the Athens-Clarke County Commission.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 9-2-2003, § 2; Ord. of 2-7-2006, § 3; Ord. of 2-7-2006, § 3; Ord. of 6-5-2007, § 2; Ord. of 7-1-2008, § 2; Ord. of 5-5-2009, § 3; Ord. of 2-2-2010, § 2; Ord. of 4-6-2010, § 11; Ord. of 9-4-2012, § 3; Ord. of 12-4-2012, § 1; Ord. of 12-4-2012, § 2; Ord. of 2-4-2014, § 1; Ord. of 2-4-2014, § 2; Ord. of 7-3-2018(2), § 4 ; Ord. of 7-2-2019(3), § 1 )
Sec. 9-3-4. - District boundaries.
When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, the following rules shall apply:
A.
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following the Athens-Clarke County line; a corporate limits line; a militia district line; a lot line; the centerline of a street, a public road, a state highway, an interstate highway; or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary line. Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as following the right-of-way boundary of an existing or abandoned street, public road, state highway, interstate highway, or railroad, the existing or abandoned centerlines of such rights-of-way shall be construed as the zoning district boundary line. In those cases where only a portion of a right-of-way has been abandoned, the new centerline of the remaining right-of-way shall be construed as the zoning district boundary line.
B.
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being the noted distance, or failing such a note, the scaled distance from the centerline of the street or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.
C.
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the noted distance, or failing such a note, the scaled distance from the lot lines. If a district boundary divides a lot into two districts, the entire lot shall be placed in the district that accounts for the greater area of the lot by the adjustment of the district boundary, provided the boundary adjustment is for a distance not to exceed 20 feet.
D.
Where zoning district boundaries are in doubt, the planning department staff shall identify such boundaries using the appropriate scale from the official zoning map.
E.
In those cases where only a portion of a lot is within a zoning district, required setbacks shall be measured from the property line and not the zoning district boundary.
F.
Whenever a zoning district boundary line divides a structure, the use of the entire structure shall either be those uses permitted in the less intensive district, or if more than 50 percent of the heated area of the structure and lot are located in the more intensive district and has its street frontage and access located in the more intensive district, the entire structure may be used for any use permitted in the more intensive district. This clause only applies to the use of the structure and not the surrounding property. The use of the surrounding property or expansion of the structure must follow the requirements of the district in which it is located. In addition, the heated floor space of such structure cannot be increased (if less than 50 percent of the structure is located in the more intensive district) so as to increase the percentage of the structure located in the more intensive district above 50 percent. If a structure is more than 50 percent located in the more intensive district, expansion of the structure for nonresidential use may only occur in the more intensive district. If such structure is used for any nonresidential use, front, rear, and side yard buffer requirements are applicable with the necessary buffer/screening requirements situated on the property lines and not the zoning boundary. Lot coverage, whether residential or nonresidential, may be calculated using the entire area of the lot; however, no development from the more intensive district can occur within the less intensive district. Lots split by a zoning boundary which do not involve a structure are restricted to the uses and standards outlined in each district. Lots involving structures that are split by a zoning boundary which do not have at least 50 percent of the heated floor space of the structure in the more intensive zoning classification are not eligible for any extensions and must abide by the regulations of the two districts.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 6-6-2006, § 1)
Sec. 9-3-5. - Digital mapping.
Digital maps, created through the use of geographic information system technology, containing registration points recorded on the Georgia State Plane Coordinate System of 1985, as amended, may be used in the administration and enforcement of this title, but shall not replace the paper originals of official maps required by this title, as referenced in section 9-3-3.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-3-6. - Changes to map; located in clerk's office; clerk to be final authority.
A.
If, in accord with the provisions of this title, changes are made in district boundaries portrayed on the official zoning map, the date of such changes shall be promptly noted on the official zoning map after the amendment has been approved by the mayor and commission of Athens-Clarke County and duly noted in the minutes of the commission meeting.
B.
No changes of any nature shall be made to the official zoning map except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this title.
C.
Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map shall at all times be located in the office of the clerk of Athens-Clarke County Commission, and the clerk shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of Athens-Clarke County.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-3-7. - Replacement of official zoning map.
In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the mayor and commission of Athens-Clarke County may by ordinance adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the official zoning map, except in accordance with the procedures of this title.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
