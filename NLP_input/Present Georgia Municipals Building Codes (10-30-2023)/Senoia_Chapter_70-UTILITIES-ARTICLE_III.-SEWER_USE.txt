Editor's note— Ord. No. 03-02, § 1, adopted Aug. 18, 2003, amended Art. III in its entirety. Former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1980, § 9-1-8; Ord. of July 6, 1992; and Ord. No. 00-07.5, adopted Oct. 2, 2000.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 70-76. - Purpose and policy.
(a)
Compliance with state and federal water pollution control laws. This article sets forth uniform requirements for persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act, as amended, and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403).
The federally mandated objectives of this ordinance are:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the city wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the city wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3)
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system; and
(4)
To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the city wastewater system.
This article provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the city wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems.
(b)
Applicability. This article shall apply to the residents of the city and to all users of the city water and wastewater systems including persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city water and wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of water and wastewater department or his/her designee shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the article.

The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The industrial user may, however, request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The industrial user may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 11), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-92. - Federal and state requirements.
(a)
Any laws or regulations promulgated by the State of Georgia relative to the construction or use of wastewater facilities which are more strict than the regulations provided in the City Code are incorporated herein by reference, and such regulations shall be enforced by the city.
(b)
Federal pretreatment standards.
(1)
The federal government has adopted regulations governing wastewater discharges from industries into POTWs. These federal regulations are generally referred to as the federal pretreatment standards, as set forth in 40 CFR Part 403, or the federal categorical pretreatment standards, as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 405—471. Any portion of these federal standards which are more strict than the regulations provided in the City Code are incorporated herein by reference, and such regulations will be enforced by the city.
(2)
It is the affirmative obligation of all industrial users regulated by the federal pretreatment standards, inclusive of the federal categorical pretreatment standards, to comply with the federal standards whether or not the industry has received notification from the city or any other jurisdiction of the existence and nature of the federal standards.
(3)
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated.
(4)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(5)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(6)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(7)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(c)
Modifications to federal pretreatment standards.
(1)
From time to time the federal government may alter existing federal pretreatment standards or promulgate new standards. None of the provisions contained in the City Code shall prevent the timely implementation of new or altered federal standards by the industries to whom the new or altered standards apply. Where new or altered federal standards are more strict than the standards presently being imposed by the city, the city may, without prejudice, immediately revise any industrial wastewater discharge permits to reflect the new or altered standards. If the industrial user is unable to immediately conform to the new or altered standards, a reasonable schedule for compliance shall be provided by the director.

Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(i)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) above.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(j)
All sampling and testing performed under this subsection for reporting requirements shall be conducted in accordance with section 70-94.
(k)
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.

(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 19), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-100. - Industrial pretreatment facilities.
(a)
Requirement for. All users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the limitations and provisions contained in this article and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city prior to commencement of construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(b)
Compliance schedules. The timing of construction and operation of pretreatment facilities as required hereby shall be in accordance with the compliance schedules provided by the city as described in subsection 70-97(b); however, the city shall also have the authority to issue compliance schedules independent of the permitting process and such compliance schedules may be enforced by the city as provided in the enforcement and penalties section of this chapter.
(c)
Maintenance of pretreatment facilities. All wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the facilities.
(d)
Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
(e)
The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(f)

(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 20), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-101. - Fats, oils and grease/BOD ordinance.
modified
(a)
Purpose. Excessive amounts of fats, oils and grease, grit, sand and other solids or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system, causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation and vehicle maintenance facilities.
This regulation sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial/residential waste into the city's sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial/residential waste sludge and byproducts.
The objective of this regulation is:
(1)
To reduce sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) caused by fats, oil, and grease (FOG) in the city sewer collection system;
(2)
To minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system;
(3)
To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the Rules and Regulations of the State of Georgia, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Division;
(4)
To provide for the requirement and permitting of grease interceptors in food service establishments;
(5)
To provide for the mandatory cleaning of grease traps;
(6)
To prohibit the use of certain additives in grease traps;
(7)
To provide for the reduction of FOG/BOD into the city's sewer system;
(8)
To prohibit the discharge of certain wastes into the city's sanitary sewer system;
(9)
To provide for the collection of a fee for the cleaning of trap waste when performed by the city;
(10)
To provide for penalties in the event of permit violations; and
(11)

Grease interceptors required under this section shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility, and upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line(s). A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the city. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(j)
Best management practices. It is the requirement of the FSE's management to provide and have posted best management practices (BMP) in an effort to reduce the amount of grease entering the system. Best management practices material can be requested from public works.
Design Criteria
(a)
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the city. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology of at least 90 percent removal efficiency.
(b)
Access. Access shall be installed to manufacturer's specs for accessibility and proper cleaning. Interceptors shall not be located in heavily trafficked areas such as driving lanes of a parking lot that may interfere with inspection and maintenance capabilities. The covering(s) shall terminate to be level with the surrounding area.
(c)
Load-bearing capacity. For interceptors located in outside areas, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity.
(d)
Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. For concrete grease interceptors the inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to ⅔ of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe. Hydromechanical grease interceptors are to be installed in accordance to manufacturer's specifications.
(e)
Concerning strip malls and suites. In the cases where several facilities are connected as one building such as suites, each individual business shall be required to have its own trap/interceptor. If this is not possible it is the building owner's sole responsibility in reference to all cleanings, maintenance and fines procured by these businesses.
(f)
Three-compartment sinks. Any three-compartment sink in a FSE shall install a wet waste interceptor, solid interceptor or similar properly sized for the sink per manufacturer's specifications.
(g)
Dish washer/dish machine. It is to the discretion of the city if the dish machine shall be connected to the trap/interceptor.
(h)
Grease trap or interceptor sizing. According to the uniform plumbing code (UPC), the difference between a grease trap and a grease interceptor is the flow rate of wastewater the device can handle. Grease traps have a flow rate of less than 50 gallons per minute, are smaller, and are usually found inside the kitchen, and can vary in size, from as small as a box to as large as a mini-fridge. The city regulations do not allow any grease traps smaller than a 70-pound capacity.
Alternatively, grease interceptors have a flow rate of more than 50 gallons per minute, are much larger, and due to their size, they are installed underground and outside of the building.
Pre-determining accurate sizing of proposed grease traps and/or interceptors is an inaccurate science at best as flow amounts and grease production assessments are dependent on numerous factors that are difficult to define.
Still, it may be helpful to estimate approximate sizing prior to an installation, and various formulas have been developed for assessing sizing requirements. These formulas are discussed below and on the following page to assist with the planning process.
Sizing and Selecting Hydromechanical Grease Interceptors (HGI)
The following two-step sizing methodology for hydromechanical grease interceptors (HGIs) shall apply regardless of whether the unit will be installed indoors or outdoors:
Step 1: Size by Flow Rate
The minimum flow rate for a passive HGI may be calculated by either using fixture volume or pipe diameter with either a one-minute or two-minute drainage period. Use a one-minute drainage period when the interceptor is installed within 20 feet of directly connected fixtures and/or has indirectly connected fixtures. Use a two-minute drainage period when the interceptor will be installed exterior to the building beyond 20 feet of the connected fixtures.
Fixture Volume Sizing
When the final configuration of kitchen fixtures in an establishment is known, use the following formula for sizing fixtures by volume with a 75 percent fill factor:
(# of compartments x [L (inches) x W (inches) x H (inches)])
________ X 0.75 = Fixture Capacity Gallons
231 cubic inches per gallon
Fixture Capacity Gallons x 1 = one-minute drainage period (GPM) Fixture Capacity
Gallons x 0.5 = two-minute drainage period (GPM)
Example: three-compartment sink with each compartment being 18 x 24 x 12 inches (3 x [18" x 24" x 12"]) = 15,552 cubic inches (in 3 )
15,552 / 231 = 67.3 total fixture capacity gallons
67.3 x 0.75 = 50.4 fixture capacity after loading factor (75%)
50.4 x 1 = 50 GPM (using one-minute drainage period)
or
50.4 x 0.5 = 25 GPM (using two-minute drainage period
To determine the minimum required flow rate for the HGI, calculate the capacity of each fixture that will be connected, add the volumes together, and use the appropriate drainage period. An appropriate HGI must be certified to meet the minimum flow rate as calculated.
It is advisable to use a one-minute drainage period when the HGI will be installed in the kitchen area near the fixtures being serviced. It is essential to use a one-minute drainage period when indirectly connected fixtures are connected to the HGI. A two-minute retention time assumes only directly connected fixtures are routed to the HGI. A two-minute drainage period will negatively affect the total time for draining fixtures and is often a complaint of owners.
Pipe Diameter Sizing
When the final configuration of kitchen fixtures in an establishment is unknown or to allow for the addition of fixtures in the future, the minimum HGI volume may be determined by the diameter of the drainage pipe leading from the establishment according to Table 2:
EXPAND
Table 2
Pipe Size (inches) Full-Pipe Flow (GPM) 1 One-minute drainage period (GPM) Two-minute drainage period (GPM)
2 20 20 10
3 60 75 35
4 125 125 75
5 230 250 125
6 375 400 200
2. ¼ inch per foot based on Manning's formula with friction factor N = 0.012
  When using pipe diameter sizing and the HGI is installed inside the kitchen near the fixtures being serviced, it is advisable to use a one-minute drainage period to ensure the drainage time is not a nuisance. When installed in the kitchen near the fixtures being serviced and with an indirectly connected fixture, it is essential to use a one-minute drainage period. When installed exterior to the building, where the developed length of piping can be quite long, a two-minute drainage period will provide a satisfactory result in drainage times.
Step 2: Calculate Grease Capacity
Once the minimum flow rate has been established in Step 1, calculate the minimum grease storage capacity for the HGI required for the desired pump-out frequency as follows:
To determine the correct grease factor, using Table 3, select the menu type (1 through 30), then the correct column (A through D) for whether there is a fryer and whether the establishment uses disposable or washable plates, glasses, knives, forks and spoons (flatware).

Grease Interceptor Maintenance
(a)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or to any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
Failure to provide a completed manifest certifying that the interceptor has been pumped will result in a verbal warning or a written notice of violation. Continued failure to pump will be met with a $200.00 surcharge added to the offender's water/sewer bill.
(1)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every 30—60 days as necessary. However, traps and interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carryover of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system.
(2)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the city's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 25 percent of the total depth of the trap, the city will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. Pump out orders may also be issued when pumping frequencies are extended beyond required pumping schedules.
(3)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
a.
Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or the discharge line system on a constant, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to, commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein. The use of additives can be terminated permanently by a city official as needed.
b.
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
Administrative Requirements

d.
Manifests are generally provided by the grease pumping company and once completed, must be electronically submitted to the city public works department within seven days of interceptor maintenance. This must be turned in before the last date of the clean-out cycle. Failure to provide proper paperwork will incur the $200.00 surcharge after the seven days, failure to pay the fine within seven days will result in a code enforcement visit.
e.
A manifest may not be required for under-sink or inline grease interceptors, if user can demonstrate a valid reason not to use one. If approved, maintenance logs must be substituted for the pumping manifest. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped or cleaned, hauler, disposal site, and signature. The log shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection and shall be made immediately available to the health officer or a city representative upon request. See appendix B for an example maintenance log.
Enforcement
(a)
Enforcement of these regulations shall be in accordance with the provisions of the city's sewer use ordinance, and its industrial pretreatment regulations. Failure to comply with this program may result in notification to the city code enforcement or county health department to request enforcement actions that may lead to revocation of the food service permit and/or the city revoking the business license. The permit may be reissued by the city upon remedy of the non-compliance that caused the suspensions, revocation or modification of the permit. Those authorized by the city sewer department are allowed to fine up to $200.00 as a surcharge on the offender's water/sewer bill. Section 70-109, High strength wastewater surcharge, defines several parameters which qualify as high strength and thus will incur the surcharge.

Sec. 70-104. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Bypass. For the purposes of this section,
(1)
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2)
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d)
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1)
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3)
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) above.
(e)
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) above.
(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 24), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-105. - City's right of revision.

(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 25), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-106. - Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 26), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-107. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as "trade secrets" under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. To the extent allowed by law, when requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 27), 8-18-2003)

(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 28), 8-18-2003)
Sec. 70-109. - High strength wastewater surcharge.
(a)
Establishment of surcharge. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the city wastewater system may be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the below shown parameters in excess of the below shown monthly average concentrations:
(1)
Five day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 500 mg/l.
(2)
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 500 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 1,000 mg/l.
(3)
Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3+NH4) of 30 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 45 mg/l.
(4)
Total phosphorus of 15 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 25 mg/l.
(5)
Floatable oil and grease of 100 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 150 mg/l.
The above parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 70-94.
The amount of the surcharge, which may be charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the city wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess oxygen demand, ammonia, total phosphorus, and floatable oil and grease. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(b)
Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown above exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a), above, the excess concentrations may be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula:
Surcharge $/month = P x G x 8.34 x C
Where:
"P" is the excess monthly average concentration in mg/l of the parameter (BOD5, etc.) being evaluated; i.e. the actual concentration less the allowable concentration listed in paragraph (a) would be the excess. The maximum concentration shown in paragraph (a) above shall not be exceeded.
"G" is equal to the user's monthly wastewater flow in millions of gallons.
"8.34" is a conversion factor.
"C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the director based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary.
(c)
Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD5, COD, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, or floatable oil and grease) shall be conducted as follows:
(1)
Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the industrial user as specified in the user's permit except that frequency of testing for surchargeable parameters shall be a minimum of two tests per month. If the permit requires more frequent testing, then the average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If the permit requires less frequent testing for compliance purposes, then testing frequency will be increased to twice per month.
(2)
The city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense. The city will split the sample with the industrial user at the user's request.
(d)
Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section will be included on the user's regular water and sewer bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill.
(Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(§ 29), 8-18-2003)
