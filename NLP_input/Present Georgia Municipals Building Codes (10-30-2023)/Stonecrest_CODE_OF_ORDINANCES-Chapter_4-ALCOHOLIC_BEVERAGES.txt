(1)
Nudity, partial nudity, conduct by bikini-clad persons, and/or sexual conduct coupled with alcohol in public places begets negative secondary effects, including sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among patrons and employees resulting in violation of laws and in dangers to the health, safety and welfare of the public;
(2)
Physical contact between employees of alcoholic beverage establishments, including "bed" dances, "couch" dances, and "lap" dances as they are commonly called, are associated with and can lead to illicit sexual activities, including masturbation, lewdness, and prostitution, as well as other negative effects, including sexual assault;
(3)
The city finds that the foregoing conduct, even when the employees are technically not nude or semi-nude, as defined in other portions of Stonecrest city regulations, is substantially similar to and presents similar concerns as conduct by nude and semi-nude performers in sexually oriented businesses;
(4)
Each of the negative effects targeted by this section constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing such negative effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between the regulated establishments and other, non-regulated establishments. The city finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to the city's interest in preventing illicit sexual behavior.
The city adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to adverse secondary effects, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
(d)
On-premises conduct. No licensee, as defined in this chapter, shall knowingly violate the following regulations or knowingly or recklessly allow an employee or any other person to violate the following regulations:
(1)

(4)

This subsection does not apply to conduct in theaters, concert halls, art centers, museums, or similar establishments that are primarily devoted to the arts or theatrical performances, when the performances that are presented are expressing matters of serious literary, artistic, scientific, or political value. The exception in the previous sentence shall not be construed to apply to any sexually oriented business, as defined in this Code.
