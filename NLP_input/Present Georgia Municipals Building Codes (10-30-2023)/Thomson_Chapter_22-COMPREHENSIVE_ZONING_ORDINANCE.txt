(a)
Intent. It is the nature of this section to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights; however, this chapter recognizes that the elimination of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses which would violate the purpose, intent and provisions of this chapter. A structure, building or use which was established before the effective date of this chapter and which does not conform to one or more of the requirements of this chapter is a nonconformity. Such nonconformity may be continued in perpetuity, shall not be converted to any other use except a conforming use and shall not be reestablished after discontinuance of operation for one year.
(b)
Maintenance and repairs. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 75 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, provided that the bulk existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
(c)
Expansion of nonconformity. A nonconforming use of land or structure cannot be expanded except upon approval of the planning commission under provisions of this chapter as outlined in section 22-143.

For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the planning commission, the special circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance. There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land.

a.
To review applications for changes to zoning classifications (i.e., zoning changes), to hear after prescribed public notice, public testimony regarding the proposed changes; to review the current comprehensive plan and future land use map, as applicable; to consider the effect of the proposal upon the public welfare; and to render a written recommendation to the appropriate governing body; the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners, Thomson City Council, or Dearing Town Council regarding proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan, land development code, official zoning map, or other amendments to these regulations.

5.
The proposed relief will grant the minimum deviation from the requirements of this chapter that is necessary to mitigate the hardship.

ARTICLE V. - SIGN STANDARDS[4]
modified

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 544 , adopted Mar. 11, 2010, amended Art. V in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. V, §§ 22-201—22-214, pertained to similar subject matter. For prior history, see Code Comparative Table.

Sec. 22-201. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
In order to protect the public safety, including traffic safety, to assure aesthetic harmony and compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in streets and roads, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, and to provide for orderly and reasonable display of advertisements for the benefit of all its citizens, the governing authority finds that the improper control of signs would be detrimental to the unique characteristics of the city. The governing authority thus determines that the public health, safety, and welfare require the adoption of this article.
(b)
The governing authority finds that signs and advertising are proper and necessary uses of private property and can constitute a legitimate business entitled to the protection of the law. A sign by its very nature is designed to draw an individual's attention to that sign. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication; however, this same characteristic can distract motorists and pedestrians, thus creating traffic hazards.
(c)
The governing authority further finds that the clutter created by an excess in number, size, and height of signs creates a distraction to travelers and negatively impacts the general appearance of an area. Signs may lessen the aesthetic qualities of an area and may intrude upon the residential character of an area, as well as property values.
(d)
The governing authority further finds that signs and advertising should be reasonably regulated in the interest of traffic safety, aesthetics and public welfare by the establishment of standards for the location, size, illumination, number, construction, and maintenance of all signs and advertising structures in the city, and to ensure that they are structurally safe and sound.
Note: At its discretion, the planning commission may defer the review of the sign and/or sign material to the historic preservation commission.
( Ord. No. 544, 3-11-10 )
Sec. 22-202. - Permitted signs.
Note: For purposes of these standards, all signs referenced herein, unless otherwise specified, shall be restricted to static signs (non-changeable copy). For digital or manual change copy signs, see section 22-203(9) and (10).
