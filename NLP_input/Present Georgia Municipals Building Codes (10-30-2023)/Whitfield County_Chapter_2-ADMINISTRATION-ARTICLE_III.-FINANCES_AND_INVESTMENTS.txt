Sec. 2-103. - Deposits and cash management policy.
The deposits and cash management policy is written to provide guidance to employees of Whitfield County in handling receipts of cash and checks from customers and vendors and for the management of cash kept on the premises. Proper adherence to the policy provides protection to both the employee and to the county and provides the documents necessary to efficiently manage the county's bank accounts.
(1)
Deposits. Many employees receive funds for deposit on behalf of Whitfield County. However, the county administrator is ultimately responsible for the proper management of the county's bank accounts. It is therefore essential for those employees taking deposits to follow the same policy. The guidelines for deposits are as follows:
a.
All deposits will be listed on the deposit slips and will designate cash and/or checks.
b.
Deposits will be balanced prior to completing the bottom deposit slip.
c.
Both copies of the bottom deposit slip will be stamped with the proper account number for deposit.
d.
Deposit bags will be secured for delivery to the bank.
e.
Upon return from the bank, the bank deposit slip will be attached to the original deposit slip as well as the journal and any supporting documents for the monthly reconciliation.
(2)
Cash management. Each employee handling cash must accept responsibility for his or her own cash bag. Security and control are important factors that should be applied to all areas of cash management. Following are the guidelines for proper cash management:
a.
The county must bond any employee that handles cash on a regular basis.
b.
Each employee should have his or her own cash bag. There should be no sharing of bags at any time.
c.
Each employee should have a key that opens his or her bag only. There should be a second key to each bag for emergency purposes that is accessible only through the county administrator. In the event that a bag must be used when an employee is absent, two employees should count the bag before use and at the end of the day and initial and date the balance sheet.
d.
Employees should count bags at the beginning and end of each day and initial and date the balance sheet. When an employee leaves his or her workstation, the bag should be secured (ex. placing bag in locked compartment).
