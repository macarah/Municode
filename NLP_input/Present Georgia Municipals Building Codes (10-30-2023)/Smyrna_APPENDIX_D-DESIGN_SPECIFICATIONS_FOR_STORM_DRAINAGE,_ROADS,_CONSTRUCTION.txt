The city distribution systems shall be designed to the following design standards. Installation of distribution water lines and appurtenances, other than by the city, shall first be submitted by way of construction drawing. Construction drawings shall meet the city design standards in order for approval to be given by the city. Design flow for all new installations shall be a minimum of 1,000 gpm at 35 psi residual. Only after plan approval shall the installations of distribution water lines and appurtenances begin.
(2)
Piping shall not be laid on exposed rock or aggregate and all backfill is required to be clean and free of rocks. Bed fill shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent standard Proctor. All changes in direction including tees, bends, caps, plugs, hydrants and other fittings are to be thrust blocked to prevent leakage and or separation of joints.
(3)
Buildings containing five or more family dwelling units or an integrated complex of buildings containing the same shall be served by a water master meter, unless otherwise authorized by the water system director or his representative. The owner of such buildings, or a homeowner's association provided there are multiple owners, shall be responsible for payment for all water and wastewater services rendered to such buildings and units by the city. Further, the owner or homeowner's association shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of water, wastewater, and storm water facilities on the user side of the master meter. For all new multi-family homes where a water master meter is utilized, installation of a sub-unit water meter for each dwelling unit is required at the time of construction. Purchase and installation of sub-unit water meters are the responsibility of the owner. The owner, or a homeowner's association for such buildings provided there are multiple owners, shall be solely responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of water facilities on the user side of the master meter. The city shall bill the owner or homeowner's association for water and wastewater service based on the master meter readings.
(f)
Flow test.
(1)
Before acceptance by the city, the water and or utility contractor shall have hydrant flow tests performed on all hydrants installed. This test will be conducted in the presence of the city site development inspector. Tests shall be conducted by an approved testing company and shall include flow, GPM, static pressure, pitot reading and hydrant type, year and location. Results shall be submitted to the site inspector in writing when complete.
(g)
Valves.
(1)
All required valves throughout the distribution system are required to be M & H mechanical joint gate valves with wrench nuts. Valves shall be right hand operation only. Valve spacing shall be a maximum of 1,000 ft with valves installed at all intersections where change in direction occurs. Valve boxes are required for each valve including concrete valve pads installed to grade. Valves boxes that occur in roadways will be flush with top of pavement. Valve boxes shall not occur within a curb line.
(h)
Dead ends.
The installation of water mains shall not cause a dead end. A loop shall be provided at such dead ends with 2 ½-inch PVC 200 psi water line #1120, ASTM D 2241. The line shall be valved with a 2½-inch Ford Gate Valve with wrench nut. The PVC water line shall be wrapped with a continuous No. 6 insulated copper wire and terminate in each valve box to enable access for electronic locating.

The developer, purchaser and or contractor shall be responsible for the final placement of all meter boxes when finish landscape does not exist during placement of meter. Meter shall be centered in meter box and bottom of meter shall be at bottom of meter box elevation.
(j)
Testing for soundness and tightness.
(1)
After water main piping is installed all sections shall be filled, air shall be released from the system through curb stops and hydrants, sit idle for at least 24 hours before the test starts. The pressure shall be brought up to 150 psi by using hydrostatic equipment and maintained for a period of four hours. Any loss of pressure will indicate leakage. When leakage occurs repairs shall be made and the test repeated until 150 psi is maintained for four hours.
(k)
Disinfection.
(1)
Main repairs.
If repairs are made under continuous pressure no disinfection is required.
When mains are required to be opened all trenches shall be dewatered. All pipe, fittings and materials used in the repair shall be flushed and swabbed with a five percent hypochlorite solution. System flushing shall occur after repairs are made. The main shall be disinfected if practical using a 500 mg/l dose of sodium hypochlorite with 30 minute contact time. Flushing after disinfection is required until a chlorine residual of less than one mg/l is obtained. Samples must be collected and tested for satisfactory microbiological quality prior to placing line into service.
(2)
New mains.
Every effort shall be made to prevent the contamination of newly installed water mains. Materials such as dirt, construction debris, animals, rodents, dirty water, etc., shall be kept outside the water main using every effort possible while the main installation is in progress.
All mains shall be flushed completely at a minimum velocity of 2.3 ft/sec. for at least 30 minutes, before the disinfection process is performed. Disinfection of new water mains shall be accomplished by the continuous method only. Sodium hypochlorite at 15 percent available chlorine or calcium hypochlorite at 65 percent available chlorine is approved liquid chlorination methods.
The chlorine dose after injection shall be at 50 mg/l at all sampling points of the water main. Once obtained a minimum contact time of 24 hours is required. After contact time minimum chlorine residual of 25 mg/l shall be obtained at all sampling points. Failure to obtain a minimum of 25 mg/l shall result in a repeat of the chlorination process. The water and or utility contractor shall be responsible for having all chlorination testing performed and shall use a certified laboratory to validate test results. All sampling is required to be conducted in the presence of the city site development inspector or his designee. The city shall be copied on test report.
After disinfection of a new water main the system shall be flushed to produce a chlorine residual of less than one mg/l. A bacteriological test is now required. The water or utility contractor is responsible for this test, which shall be obtained and tested by the Cobb Marietta Water Authority in the presence of the city site development inspector or his designee. Failure to obtain a negative bacteriological test shall result in a repeat of the chlorination process. The city shall be copied on test report.
All water with a chlorine residual greater than one mg/l shall be disposed of in the following manor:
a.
Sanitary sewer system, after notification to the city and waste treatment plant operator.
b.
Storm sewer, after de-chlorination or chlorine residual is below one mg/l
c.
Land disposal where adequate dilution and travel time will result in a chlorine residual of less than one mg/l.
(l)
Main lines.
