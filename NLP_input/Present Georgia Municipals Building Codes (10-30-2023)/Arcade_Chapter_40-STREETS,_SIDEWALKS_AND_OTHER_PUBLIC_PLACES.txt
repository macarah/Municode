Type (species) of trees and planting location will be determined by the city beautification committee. Should the planting season, at the time of removing such old trees, not be conducive to planting new ones, the person or business responsible for having these trees removed will pay the city the purchase price of such trees as are required for replacements. Such monies will be deposited by the city into a special beautification fund to be used by the beautification committee as it recommends.
(s)
It shall be unlawful for any person, distributing or causing to be distributed, circulars, handbills, papers, or other printed advertising matter through the city, to throw into or place in any yard, dwelling, or place of business more than one of the circulars, handbills, papers, or printed advertising matter which such person may be distributing.

Following the effective date of this article from which this section is derived, each utility who seeks to have facilities located in the rights-of-way under the control of the city, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, must be registered with the city administrator and shall obtain a permit from the city administrator prior to installation of any new facility.
(c)
Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city administrator and include, but not be limited to:
(1)
The name, legal status (i.e., partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant").

(2)
The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s).

Protection of traffic and roadway.

(3)
Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the city and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation.
(4)
Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.

Require the utility to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities.
