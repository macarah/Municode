(Ord. No. 2015-09, § 1(Exh. A), 11-10-2015)
Sec. 12-21. - Occupation tax levied; rate of tax; restrictions.
(a)
An occupation tax shall be levied upon those businesses and practitioners of professions and occupations with one or more locations or offices in the corporate limits of the city and upon the applicable out-of-state businesses with no location or office in the state pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-7, based upon a combination of profitability classification, taxable gross receipts and the number of employees of the business or practitioner.
(b)
The occupation tax shall be determined by applying the business' gross receipts and number of employees to the tax rate table for the business' profitability classification established for each business type.
(c)
The tax rate for the classifications shall be set by council with resolution or ordinance.
(d)
All occupation taxes levied by this article are levied on taxable gross receipts during the current calendar year and the number of employees to be employed in the business conducted. For new businesses, the occupation tax for the year of commencement shall be based upon an estimate of gross receipts of the business from the date of commencement until the end of that year. Continuing businesses subject to the occupational tax shall file with the city an affidavit showing all gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year ending on December 31. This affidavit showing preceding calendar year gross receipts shall be used as an estimate of gross receipts for making payments on the occupation tax for the current tax year. The number of employees reported for the current year's business operations may be based upon the number of employees employed in the business conducted during the previous year. Applicants or owners engaged in the business shall be reported as employees of the business. The affidavit showing the business' preceding year's actual gross receipts and number of employees shall also be used to adjust the estimated occupation tax for the same period. Should a business not continue or terminate during the year, such business shall notify the city's business occupation tax section and file a final return reporting the actual number of employees and those gross receipts not previously reported and making payment of any tax due.
(e)
The gross receipts tax shall include a flat rate of $125.00 for the first $249,999.99 of gross revenue and a fee per employee. Gross revenues above $250,000.00 are taxed using a class table based on profitability, a tax factor and a fee per employee. The tax rate table will be set by mayor and council by ordinance or resolution.
(f)
Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the affidavit shall contain a figure that puts such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
(g)
In the event a business's actual amount of gross receipts in a given year are less than what was estimated, and it results in a fee difference, the business shall be responsible for submitting a written request for a refund of the difference by April 1 of the subsequent tax year; said request must be accompanied by financial support, i.e. tax return for that tax year. If the refund is substantiated, a refund will be processed within 30 days.
(h)
In the event a business's actual amount of gross receipts in a given year are more than what was estimated, and it results in a fee difference, the business shall be responsible for payment of the difference upon subsequent year's renewal, termination of the business or April 1 of the subsequent year, whichever is sooner; this additional tax due is subject to the penalties as outlined in this chapter for occupation taxes due.
(i)
No refund or proration shall be made for a taxpayer who shall cease doing business or remove the business from the city.
(j)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a lawyer begins or continues business after January 1 of the occupation tax year, the tax on such business shall be due and payable on December 31 of the year in which the business begins or continues. Any lawyer failing to pay the occupation tax within 120 days after December 31 shall be considered delinquent and shall be subject to and shall pay a ten percent penalty of the amount of tax or fee due and interest as provided by state law. Such penalty shall be assessed in full on the 121st day of the year following the tax year in addition to interest on delinquent occupational taxes. In addition, a list of all delinquent lawyers may be sent to the State Bar of Georgia. The general penalty for continuing violations of this code shall not apply to violations of this chapter by lawyers. Specifically, failing to comply with the article will not result in the city closing the business or penalizing the continued practice of law by fining, imprisoning or criminalizing noncompliance.
(k)
The city shall not require the payment of more than one occupational tax for each location that a business or practitioner shall have nor shall the city require a business to pay an occupational tax for more than 100 percent of the business' gross receipts.
(l)
Real estate brokers shall pay an occupational tax for each principal office and each separate branch office located in the city based upon gross receipts derived from transactions with respect to property located within the city. Payment of the occupation tax shall permit the broker, the broker's affiliated associates and salespersons to engage in all of the brokerage activities described in O.C.G.A. § 43-40-1 without further licensing or taxing other than the state licenses issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 40. No additional license, occupation or professional tax shall be required of the brokers affiliated associate brokers or salespersons; provided, however, that, subject to the limitations of subsection (b) of this code section, a municipality or county which levies a general occupation or business license tax on a gross receipts basis shall have the power to levy and collect an occupation, license, or professional tax upon real estate brokers transacting business within the boundaries of the taxing jurisdiction, which tax shall be based upon gross receipts derived from transitions with respect to property located within the boundaries of a taxing jurisdiction.
(m)
For out-of-state businesses with no location in the state, occupation taxes include the gross receipts of the business as defined in section 12-16.
(n)

If no tax return has been filed for the applicable year, the applicant must swear under oath and penalty of perjury that no tax return has been filed for the applicable year, and the gross receipts as presented to the city are true and correct to the best of the applicant's knowledge, ability and training based on financial documents such as CPA statement and/or the business's annual profit and loss statement.
(o)
No portion of the tax may be prorated.
(p)
For purposes of determining the number of employees of a business, trade, or practitioner, an employee who works 40 hours or more weekly shall be considered a fulltime employee, and the average weekly hours of employees who work less than 40 hours weekly shall be added and such sum shall be divided by 40 to produce fulltime position equivalence. For purposes of this section, the number of employees shall be the number of fulltime employees or fulltime position equivalence.
(q)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, practitioners of professions as described in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-9(c)(1) through (18) shall elect as their entire occupation tax one of the following:
(1)
The occupation tax based on number of employees and gross receipts combined with profitability ratios as set forth in this article; or
(2)
Four hundred dollars for the year 2014 and subsequent years, but a practitioner paying according to this shall not be required to provide information relating to the gross receipts of such practitioner.

(c)
