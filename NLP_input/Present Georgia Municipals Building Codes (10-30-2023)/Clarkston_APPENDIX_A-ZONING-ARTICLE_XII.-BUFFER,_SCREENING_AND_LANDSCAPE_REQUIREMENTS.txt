ARTICLE XII. - BUFFER, SCREENING AND LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 1201. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to ensure and facilitate the preservation and/or replacement of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process within Clarkston and to provide minimum landscape, buffer and screening standards for commercial developments in the city so as to enhance architectural features, improve energy efficiency, improve water quality, reduce environmental damage, reduce urban heat island effect, provide quality wildlife habitat, control of soil erosion and aesthetics and to provide a scenic amenity within Clarkston. In addition to the regulations set forth herein, the regulations in The Clarkston Tree Protection Plan shall also apply. All tree protection plans and landscape plans submitted to meet city requirements shall be prepared and stamped by a Georgia licensed landscape architect, provided however that an architect or engineer may also provide such plans if knowledgeable in landscape architectural design and/or tree protection plan preparation.
Sec. 1202. - Buffer required.
The mayor and city council recognize that the location of non-residential land uses directly adjacent to single-family, two-family, or multiple-family residential uses can create an incompatible situation. Similarly, the location of two-family or multiple-family land uses directly adjacent to single-family land uses can also create an incompatible situation.
Sec. 1203. - General buffer requirements.
A planted or natural buffer strip is required to protect single-family, two-family, and multiple-family residential land uses from negative impacts such as litter, dust, wind, light spill, noise, unsightly views, and other characteristics commonly associated with non-residential land uses and related vehicular and pedestrian traffic which adversely impact the quality of residential life. The required buffer shall provide necessary visual and acoustical privacy for the conduct of residential uses in an undisturbed environment and shall assist in the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts.
Required buffer strips shall be established and maintained by the owner of the non-residential land use. The required buffer strip shall:
(1)
Be depicted in detail on each site plan or plat prior to final approval. Type and location of natural and planted vegetation shall be included.
(2)
Not be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense to permit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers, or any similar city approved enhancement. Any contemplated disturbance shall first be brought to the attention of the city and formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within the required buffer areas.
(3)
Utilize existing vegetation where the city has determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip, or when required, be supplemented with approved, additional plantings.
(4)
Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(5)
Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by local law, or for a structure other than a fence.
(6)
Be planted and maintained in a healthy, growing condition by the property owner.
(7)
Not extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building setback line of the adjoining lot.
(8)
Preserve the natural topography of the land and shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion; provided such easement shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvements.
Sec. 1204. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Ord. No. 375, § 13, adopted Oct. 1, 2013, repealed former § 1204 in its entirety which pertained to minimum buffer specifications and derived from Ord. No. 325, § 1, adopted April 23, 2007.
