Sec. 22-548. - Bonds or escrow required.
(a)
If, at the time the final plat is submitted for approval, the construction of the street improvements has not been accomplished, then the final plat shall be disapproved. No performance bonds shall be allowed or authorized except the mayor shall require a performance bond to be filed with the city to ensure that all final road improvements required by this Code are made by the owner or applicant. The city shall accept no road until such time as all road improvements required by the city are made.
(b)
After the work has been completed according to the city specifications and duly inspected by the city, then a maintenance bond shall be required equal to ten percent of the estimated construction cost.

The maintenance bond shall cover the street improvements, drainage system, water system and sewer system. Funds may be placed in escrow with the city in lieu of maintenance bonds.
(c)
The applicant shall be required to sign a maintenance agreement with the city, by which the applicant shall agree to maintain the streets, drainage, water quality BMPs, water and sewer systems, and rights-of-way for a period of 12 months. During the applicant maintenance period, the city shall make inspections and instruct the applicant by letter as to what correction must be made.
(d)
In case of emergency repairs, which must be made immediately, or required corrections, which are not made within 30 days of notice, the city shall have the authority to make these corrections and recover costs from the applicant. In cases where funds are being held in escrow by the city, the cost of making these corrections shall be deducted from these funds, and the applicant charged with any costs above the amount of escrow funds.
(e)
At the end of the 12-month applicant maintenance period, the city shall make a final inspection and notify the applicant and the bonding company of any corrections to be made.

(a)
Sidewalks shall be required on all sides of street frontage on all new and improved local residential streets in all subdivisions and along the street frontage of all new and improved nonresidential developments and as set forth in section 22-273, unless determined by the community development director to be infeasible only due to severe cross-slopes, shallow rock, soil or topographic conditions. At a minimum, however, continuous sidewalks shall be required on at least one side of all new and improved local residential streets. Refer to section 22-275 for sidewalk exemptions.
(b)
The community development director may require that sidewalks required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section be continued to the nearest major or minor arterial or collector street.
(c)
A grassed, planted or landscaped strip, as set forth in section 22-273, shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs, bridges excepted. The community development director may approve a variable sidewalk location and landscape strip width based on site conditions and future road expansions. Where sidewalks currently exist, new sidewalk construction or reconstruction shall be continuous with existing sidewalks.
(d)
Sidewalks shall be concrete with the width based on table 5.1 in the zoning ordinance and four inches thick. Concrete shall be Class B, as defined by the state department of transportation, and have a strength of 2,500 psi at 28 days.

The required width of a sidewalk may be increased, as determined by the community development director, based on site conditions to ensure pedestrian safety. See also section 22-273.
(e)
Sidewalks shall be installed at the same time as the building construction, unless an alternative method is approved by the community development director. Sidewalks shall be completed prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy for property on which the sidewalk fronts. The sidewalk plan shall be recorded on the final plat and all sidewalks completely installed prior to approval of the final plat.
(f)
Sidewalks shall not be cut, removed or closed temporarily without a permit from the community development department. Such permit shall not be issued unless safe, adequate, and convenient provision is made for pedestrian travel through the area that is disrupted. Damage to sidewalks caused during construction or development activity shall be repaired at no cost to the city within 30 days or prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever is earlier.
(g)
In any "landmark district" or "historic district," as defined by the city, where replacement or reconstruction of the sidewalk is deemed necessary, the sidewalk shall be replaced or reconstructed using materials, widths, and designs that are compatible with the historic materials and designs, if any, that exist within the historic district. Design compatibility shall be determined by the city historic preservation commission.
(h)
All sidewalk construction and repairs shall provide for wheelchair ramps to and from sidewalks at the intersection of each street corner and crosswalk. Access ramps shall be constructed pursuant to standards approved by the public works department.

Bicycle lanes shall be constructed as follows:
(1)
Bicycle lanes, where required, shall be at least four feet wide and placed in the outside lane of a roadway, adjacent to the curb or shoulder. When on-street parking is permitted, the bicycle lane shall be at least five feet wide and located between the parking lane and the outer lane of moving vehicles. Bicycle pavement widths shall be in addition to the minimum pavement width required for the road. See also section 22-273.

Bicycle lanes shall be delineated with signs and striping consistent with the latest edition of the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices, and approved by the development director.
(3)
Bikeways and bicycle lanes shall be constructed according to the most recent specifications set forth in American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines.
(4)
The design, striping and sign system for bicycle lanes shall be coordinated with that of the vehicular road system to provide a safe and continuous route for bicycles. Deceleration lanes shall be striped so that bicycles can safely remain in a lane marked between the deceleration lane and the through traffic lane.
(k)
No wall, fence, sign or other structure shall obstruct passage along a sidewalk or bicycle lane.
