The right granted to a party to erect a bridge across a public street or alley shall be subject to the condition that the city shall have the right to require the removal of the bridge if it becomes detrimental to the public health or safety, or if, after the granting of permission to erect the bridge over a particular street or alley, changes occur relative to the public use of the street or alley so that the bridge constitutes a hindrance to the public use of such street or alley. If the city makes a preliminary determination that the bridge constitutes a hazard to the public health or safety, or that the bridge has become a detriment to the use by the public of the street or alley, the city shall notify the owner of the bridge of such preliminary determination, together with a reasonable explanation of the facts upon which the determination was made, and shall offer the owner of the bridge a hearing on a date specified in the notice, before the mayor and council, within not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days following the receipt of the notice. If the owner desires a hearing, the city manager shall present the facts from which the preliminary determination was made, and the owner of the bridge shall be permitted to present any contrary contentions, or any proposals to remedy the findings of the city manager. The mayor and council, following the hearing, shall make a finding as to whether the preliminary determination was correct, and if so, whether the same can be remedied. If a determination is made that a remedy exists so that the public health or safety will be properly protected, or so that the use of the street or alley by the public can be maintained, and the owner is willing to undertake and carry out such remedy within a time frame fixed by mayor and council, then the owner shall be required to agree to do so in writing.

(Code 1965, § 27-17)
Sec. 74-34. - Liability insurance.

Sec. 74-35. - Maintenance obligations.
The special ordinance granting permission to erect any bridge shall impose a continuing obligation upon the owner of the properties affected as well as the user of the bridge to continuously maintain the bridge in a safe condition, which duty shall not be diminished by the city's initial approval of the plans and specifications for such bridge, nor by the failure of the city, from time to time, to require modifications to such bridge, and the indemnification obligation provided for in section 74-34 shall not be diminished by any such approval on behalf of the city, nor by any failure of the city to require any modifications in such bridge subsequent to the initial approval thereof.
(Code 1965, § 27-19)
Sec. 74-36. - Identification of parties to installation request.
