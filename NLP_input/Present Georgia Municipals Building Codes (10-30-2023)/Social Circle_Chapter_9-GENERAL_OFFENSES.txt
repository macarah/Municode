Chapter 9 - GENERAL OFFENSES
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 9-1. - Discharging firearms.
It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge any firearm except in the defense of person or property. However, shotgun discharge by persons age 16 years or older, with 12 gauge or smaller shotgun (no magnum loads, buckshot, slugs, 3.5" loads or similar), is allowed as follows: during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, on one's owned or leased property, and more than 250 feet from property lines and roadways. The shotgun may only be aimed above 30 degrees from horizontal, and never in the direction of any residence. No pistols, revolvers, muzzleloaders, rifles or similar firearms discharging a bullet or ball or slug are allowed in said firearm discharge. Only shotguns may be used, and only #6, #7.5, #8 and similar shot, known as birdshot or target loads, may be used.
Furthermore, on larger acreage tracts, wherein neighbor property lines and roadways are at least 200 yards from the location where the gun is to be discharged, all shotguns and shotgun loads are allowed. Muzzleloaders, carbines chambered in pistol rounds and handguns are allowed as well. .22 caliber rimfire rifles (.22 lr, .22 magnum, etc.) are permitted, but larger high pressure rifle calibers, .223 level muzzle energy and up, are prohibited due to the danger of using high powered rifles within the city limits. Provided, however, that .30-30 Winchester, .444 Marlin, .45-70, .35 Remington, and other medium pressure rounds with round nose bullets and similar ballistics are permitted due to their limited range. Such non-shotgun firearm discharge, on larger acreage tracts, wherein neighbor property lines and roadways are at least 200 yards from the location where the gun is to be discharged, may only occur in an elevated area wherein shots shall be in a downward direction. In no case under this exception language may a gun be discharged in the general direction of any residential properties. In other words, the discharge must be towards the interior of the parcel, not towards the closest property line.
Any person violating any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined up to $500.00 or be incarcerated for up to ten days, or both. Each day such violation is committed shall be a separate offense.
This Code section shall not apply to authorized officers of the law and animal control officers in the performance of their law enforcement duties and/or animal control duties. Nor shall it apply to any lawful state sanctioned hunt.

d.

A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
b.
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this Code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

(Former § 9-008)
Sec. 9-5. - Graffiti.
(a)
Purpose and intent. O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-2 and following are followed and enforced by the city. O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-3 notes that criminal street gang activity is a serious and continuing public safety concern; criminal trespass and criminal damage to property in the second degree caused by graffiti being placed unlawfully upon private property are crimes frequently associated with criminal street gang activity; and it is in the public interest, not only in the pursuit of justice but also as a means of combating such criminal street gang activity and of contributing to the general public welfare by improving the esthetics of public views, to compensate as provided in this section those private property owners who are the innocent victims of such criminal trespass or criminal damage to property in the second degree by using inmate labor to remove or obliterate graffiti unlawfully placed on private properties when such graffiti is visible from public roads or other public property. Per O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-4, the city authorizes the use of labor by inmates from any penal institution or jail under its authority to remove or obliterate such unlawfully placed graffiti when such graffiti is visible from any public road or other public property. Graffiti is detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare and constitutes a public nuisance destructive of the right and values of property owners and the entire community. Graffiti is often associated with gang activity and it harms the esthetics of public views. It promotes blight and must be abated to avoid detrimental impact and to prevent the further spread of graffiti. Without prompt removal, other properties become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places to live and work.
(b)
Public nuisance. Graffiti is a public and private nuisance and may be abated per this section and other applicable laws.
(c)
Definitions.
Graffiti means any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of real property or improvements thereon without prior authorization of the owner or occupant of the property by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark on any surface. City-approved signage is exempt.
Occupant means any person or sub-lessee, successor or assignee that has control over property.
Owner means any person, agent or entity having a legal or equitable interest in a property.
Permit means knowingly allowing graffiti or any failure, refusal or neglect to remove.
Property means any real or personal property and that which is affixed incidental or appurtenant to real property but not limited to any premises, house, building, fence, structure or any separate part thereof, whether permanent or not.
(d)
Prohibited acts. It is unlawful to apply graffiti or for any owner or occupant to permit graffiti on property.
(e)
Notice of removal. The city may serve a written notice directing the owner/occupant to remove such graffiti and advising of the appeal procedure. The notice may be served in person or by U.S. Mail, return receipt requested. If the owner/occupant cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting in a conspicuous place on the property for three days.
(f)
Abatement of nuisance. It shall be unlawful for the owner/occupant to fail to remove the graffiti within five days of notice if service is made in person or by certified mail. If service is made by posting, the owner/occupant shall remove the graffiti within five days of the first day that the property is posted.
(g)
Appeal. An appeal may be taken to the city council by the owner/occupant to prevent the removal of any graffiti, within five days of notice from the city. Appeals shall be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal. The city shall not remove or obscure any graffiti during the pendency of an appeal. If the party filing the appeal requests a hearing, such hearing shall be held within 45 days. If the city council determines the graffiti must be removed, such must be accomplished within ten days of the hearing.
(h)
Removal. If the graffiti is not completely removed by the owner/occupant within the ten days, the city may have it removed, and the city and/or its private contractor or inmates may enter upon such premises to remove such graffiti. If the owner/occupant applied the graffiti, the owner/occupant shall be liable to the city for all such expenses. The city shall record the expenses incurred in abating graffiti and shall provide a statement of such costs to the owner/occupant. If any expenses remain unpaid after 30 days, the city may sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover all such expenses incurred by the city in removing the graffiti, including attorney fees and court costs associated with the action.
(i)
Penalty. Any person convicted of violating this section may be punished by a fine of $500.00 to $1,000.00 per instance, plus may be required to reimburse the city for the expenses to remove the graffiti. The court may suspend or probate a portion or its entire sentence upon such conditions to include but not be limited to the restoring of the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, or other remedial action.
(j)
Alternate means of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the city from commencing any other available civil or criminal proceedings to abate a public nuisance under state law or city ordinance as an alternative, or in addition to, proceedings set forth in this section.
(Former § 9-009)
