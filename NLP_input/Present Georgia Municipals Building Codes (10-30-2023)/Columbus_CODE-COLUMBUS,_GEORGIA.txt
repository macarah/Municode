PREFACE
This Code is a republication of the 1978 Edition of the Columbus Code to change format to double column and include Ordinances adopted through Ordinance Number 00-90, adopted October 10, 2000.
The 1978 Edition of the Columbus Code constitutes a republication of the Code of 1957.
This Code is a revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature that were deemed advisable to be included.
This Code is an entire new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance, with the exception, however, of Chapter 12 containing certain public utility franchises, which chapter is included in this volume for information only. This Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as the ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. All the ordinances have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances completely rewritten. New words and phrases and even whole sections have been added to make this Code comprehensive in scope and lucid in meaning.
As it will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws.
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections, that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5, is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3 respectively.
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the innovation of the looseleaf system of binding and up-keep servicing for the City of Columbus. With this new looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up to date continuously. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting and deleting the obsolete pages. To each such amendment will be attached an editorial footnote explaining briefly the effect of the amendment. When incorporated into this Code, each such section may be cited as a part hereof as provided in section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance.
The successful maintaining of this Code up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing the same, and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
The general index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Time and effort have not been spared in the preparation of this Code and the publishers are most grateful to the City Attorney, Mr. Roscoe Thompson, and to the City Manager, Mr. J. A. Willman, for their cooperation and untiring efforts during the progress of the editorial work.
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of B. Meade White of the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Especial credit must be granted to Mrs. Elnora S. Fuller of the editorial staff for technical assistance, and to Mrs. Frances Ryle, Miss Remona Hearrin, Miss Gloria Paige, Mrs. Joyce Tucker and Mrs. Ruth Rogers of the publisher's secretarial staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
This republication was completed under the direct supervision of John E. Dombroski, vice president for production, and Meghan Inman, editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to other members of the publishers' staff for their able assistance throughout the project, and to Tiny B. Washington, Clerk of Council, Columbus, and other city officials for their cooperation and assistance in this publication.
This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Columbus, Georgia.

Be It Ordained by the City Commission of the City of Columbus, Georgia:
Section 1. That this ordinance, consisting of Chapter 1 to 22, each inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted as the "Code of the City of Columbus, Georgia", and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all other general and permanent ordinances passed by the City Commission, prior to March 8, 1957, except such as by reference thereto are expressly saved from repeal or continued in force and effect for any purpose; and except Chapter 12 of the Code, containing public utility franchises, which are set out in this volume for information only.
Section 2. That all provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect thirty days from date this ordinance becomes law and all ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Columbus enacted on final passage on or before March 7, 1957, and not in such Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided. That no resolution of the city, not specifically mentioned, is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That the repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution promising or guaranteeing the payment of money for the City, or authorizing the issue of any bonds of the City or any evidence of the City's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the City; nor shall such repeal affect the administrative ordinances or resolutions of the City Commission, not in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this Code, nor shall such repeal affect any right of franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the City Commission to any person, firm, or corporation; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the City; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance levying or imposing taxes, nor shall such repeal affect ordinances prescribing traffic regulations for specific locations, prescribing through streets, bus stops, taxi stands, parking prohibitions, parking limitations, one-way traffic, limitations on load of vehicles, or loading zones, not inconsistent with such Code; nor shall such repeal affect any amendment to the zoning map on file in the office of the City Auditor and Clerk; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance establishing and prescribing the street grades of any street in the City; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance providing for local improvements and assessing taxes therefor; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance dedicating or accepting any plat or subdivision in the City; nor shall it affect any ordinance extending the boundaries of the City; nor shall such repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance putting into effect any Act of the Legislature of Georgia; nor shall such repeal affect any general tax ordinance of the City or any amendments thereto.
Section 4. Any and all additions or amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Commission to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in such Code so that reference to the "Code of the City of Columbus" shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments.
Section 5. A copy of such Code shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the City Clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the City Clerk or someone authorized by him, to insert in their designated places all amendments or ordinances which indicate the intention of the City Commission to make the same a part of such Code when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the City Commission. This copy of such Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same and shall be considered the official Code of Columbus.
Section 6. In case of the amendment of any section of such Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in section 1-8 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.
Section 7. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation in the City to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the City of Columbus to be misrepresented thereby. Any person, firm or corporation violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 of the Code of the City of Columbus.
Section 8. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed.
