Each employee and/or manager will be required to renew the permit card annually.

All persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, manager, and pawnbroker shall, while on the pawnshop premises, have in their possession and available for inspection such permit card. It shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
The following qualifications shall apply to all employees and managers:
(1)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, social security number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt.

The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant.

In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this article, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal.
(4)
No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices within ten years preceding the date of application shall be issued a permit.

Pawnshop owners are required by this article to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in his possession a valid current pawnshop permit. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a pawnshop permit, the applicant may appeal the denial of the permit as provided in this article. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the permit sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a permit under this article.
(10)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police or his designee the name of the establishment, the occupation tax certificate number and a list of all employees, including their date of birth, social security number, home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.
