12.4 - Applicability.
This ordinance shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 3 of this ordinance. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
12.4.1 Grandfather provisions. This ordinance shall not apply to the following activities:
1)
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this ordinance.
2)
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
3)
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this ordinance.
4)
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of this ordinance.
12.4.2 Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this ordinance. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.

6)
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land-disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
12.4.3 Effective date. After the effective date of this ordinance, March 22, 2005, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 12.5 below.
12.5 - Land development requirements.
12.5.1 Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this ordinance shall meet the following requirements:
1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.

3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
12.5.2 Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this ordinance, and the Paulding County Water and Sewer System Department and Paulding County Community Development Department finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the request for a variance may be forwarded to the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee for a hearing.
The Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee shall hold a hearing on the variance request within 30 days of the date of the variance request or at its next regularly scheduled meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in the administration article of the development regulations. In the event the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee determines that the criteria contained herein are met, the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. In the event the party requesting the variance is aggrieved by the decision of the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee, the variance request may be appealed to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners for consideration. All such appeals of variance requests must be made in writing with a copy provided to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners and the Paulding County Community Development Department and must be submitted within 30 days of the decision by the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee. Thereafter, the Paulding County Board of Commissioners shall consider the appeal at a public meeting within 30 days or at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Paulding County Board of Commissioners may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
2)
Except as provided above, the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee and/or the board of commissioners shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Paulding County Board of Commissioners. Paulding County shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within Paulding County. Paulding County shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
(a)
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
(b)
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this ordinance, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
(a)
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
(b)
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
(c)
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
(d)
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
(e)
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
(f)
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
(g)
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
(h)
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
(a)
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
(b)
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
(c)
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
(d)
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
(e)
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
(f)
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
12.6 - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. Provided however, in the event that stream bank buffer requirements exist in other county ordinances, including the Paulding County Zoning Ordinance and other Articles of the Paulding County Development Regulations, that are less restrictive than the measurements and standards contained herein, the terms of this article shall control.
The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
12.7 - Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties.
Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following:
1)
A site plan showing:
(a)
The location of all streams on the property;
(b)
Limits of required stream buffers and setbacks on the property;
(c)
Buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five-foot contour intervals;
(d)
Delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone; and,
(e)
Detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback;
2)
A description of all proposed land development within the buffer and setback; and,
3)
Any other documentation that the (review and permitting authority) may reasonably deem necessary for review of the application and to insure that the buffer zone ordinance is addressed in the approval process.
All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval.
12.8 - Responsibility.
Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon Paulding County, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property.
12.9 - Inspection.
Paulding County may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the Paulding County representatives in making such inspections. Paulding County shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area.
