DIVISION 14. - WASTEWATER TREATMENT TAP FEES

Sec. 74-511. - Generally.
(a)
A permit from the county shall be obtained before a sewer tap is made, and such permit shall indicate that the prescribed fee has been made.
(b)
Any unauthorized person making a tap shall be punished upon conviction of an offense.
(c)
Nonwater customers and those obtaining water from wells using the county sewer system are required to meter well pumpage and shall be charged the regular sewer service fees. The property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department.
(d)
Fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) may or may not be punitive as deemed by the county.
(e)
Fines for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) can be waived, provided no harm occurred to the POTW, at the discretion of the county on a case-by-case basis.
(f)
Wastewater discharges between 300 mg/L and 850 mg/L of BOD and/or TSS will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding 600 mg/L. The purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the POTW to handle excess BOD and/or TSS, and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost.
(g)
For samples with a difficult BOD to measure accurately, chemical oxygen demand (COD) may be substituted for BOD analysis. Wastewater discharges between 750 and 2,500 mg/L of COD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding 2,500 mg/L.
Secs. 74-512â€”74-520. - Reserved.
