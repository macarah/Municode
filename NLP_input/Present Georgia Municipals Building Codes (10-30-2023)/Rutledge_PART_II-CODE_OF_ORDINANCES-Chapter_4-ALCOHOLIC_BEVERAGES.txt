(12)
The mayor and city council, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant's application or the proposed location of the business.

Sec. 4-107. - Temporary license.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person may apply as a qualified restaurant even though the establishment has not yet been in operation for the previous 12 months. Because it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales which are 75 percent or more of its total gross sales and it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales in excess of $50,000.00, the mayor and city council may in its discretion consider the size and seating capacity of the restaurant, the size and seating capacity of any lounge therein, the size and type of kitchen facilities and all other relevant factors to determine if it appears substantially likely that the restaurant will qualify for a license under this article. If the mayor and city council anticipate that the establishment will qualify for a license, they may vote to award the applicant a temporary license not to exceed 90 days. At or before the conclusion of the 90-day period, the mayor and city council shall use a pro rata analysis to determine if the applicant is operating a qualified restaurant as is defined in this chapter. If the mayor and city council has determined that the restaurant is qualified under this chapter, the applicant may make application for a license under section 4-105.
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, a nonprofit organization which has at least 50 members regularly paying monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual dues and has received and has maintained approval from the United States Internal Revenue Service as a bona fide 501(c)(3) organization, and has not applied for a license under section 4-105, may apply for a special event license.

(1)
Make application at least 14 days prior to the first date of the proposed license period; and
(2)
Pay a fee per licensed event in an amount that shall be established by the city council from time to time and set forth in the schedule of fees and charges, available for examination in the office of the city clerk; and

(6)
Only one such permit shall be issued for any one location within the incorporated limits of the city and such location shall be stated in the application; and
(7)
All applicants for a license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks or other employees shall be of good character. Furthermore, corporate or firm applicants shall also be of good business reputation; and
(8)
Whenever the mayor and city council shall deny an application for a license, the applicant shall have ten days following the date of notice of denial to request a hearing before the mayor and city council. The applicant shall be entitled at such a hearing to present evidence and cross examine opposing witnesses; and
(9)

Each licensee under this article shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the city clerk/treasurer within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter:

The forms for such quarterly verified statements shall reflect the licensee's gross dollar sales amount for total sales for the applicable calendar quarter, the gross dollar sales amount for malt beverages and wine for the applicable calendar quarter, and gross dollar sales amount for food items for the applicable calendar quarter.
(2)
Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use tax monthly reports as filed with the state department of revenue for each month during the respective calendar quarter.
(b)
Any sale of a food or beverage containing any malt beverage and/or wine shall be deemed to be a sale solely of a malt beverage and/or wine, and such sale shall not be included as a "food sale" in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds by three times the sales of malt beverages and/or wine shall not be conclusive that the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant as defined in this chapter. However, the failure of the food sales to so exceed by three times the sale of malt beverages and wine shall be prima facie evidence that the establishment is not meeting the definition of a restaurant.
(c)
The quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as otherwise required by law. Such forms shall be used solely by the mayor and city council for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its pouring license. Failure to timely file such statements shall be a violation of this article punishable by a fine of up to $500.00 and cause for revocation of the license granted under this article.
