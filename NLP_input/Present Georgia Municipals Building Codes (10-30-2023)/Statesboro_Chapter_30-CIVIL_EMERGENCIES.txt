(Ord. No. 2020-02, 3-17-20)
Sec. 30-10. - Price overcharging prohibited.
(a)
The health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city depend upon the availability and affordability of certain essential commodities and reasonable access to shelter. During certain periods of emergency, resulting from natural or manmade disasters, the public is at risk from dramatic and unjustified increases in the prices of certain essential goods, materials, services and housing. Such increases in prices may be excessive and unconscionable during an emergency and may delay recovery. Legislation is necessary to prohibit any person from raising prices for goods, materials, services and housing to excessive, unconscionable or unfair levels during an emergency or subsequent recovery period. Limitations on price overcharging during an emergency are authorized pursuant to the police powers of the City of Statesboro, Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 38-3-28, as amended.
(b)
In order to preserve, protect or sustain the life, health or safety of persons or their property, within the disaster area, it shall be unlawful, during the duration of the emergency or subsequent recovery period, for any person, firm, or corporation located or doing business in the city to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, motel rooms, temporary lodging or houses, sold or rented, within the City of Statesboro. For the purposes of this article, the term "overcharging" means charging prices for goods, materials, foods, equipment, supplies, services, labor or housing which are substantially in excess of the customary charges by 25 percent or, in applicable cases, substantially in excess of the suppliers' or providers' costs for such goods, materials, foods, equipment, supplies, services, labor or housing by 25 percent. The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a 25 percent increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies, and labor costs resulting from the emergency.
(c)
Subsequent recovery period. The term "subsequent recovery period" is defined as that period during which the emergency continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated.
(Ord. No. 2020-02, 3-17-20)
Sec. 30-11. - Enforcement and remedies.
(a)
Right of entry.

Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.
(b)
Enforcement. Except as otherwise provided for herein, and in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-4, as amended, the city's police department, emergency management coordinator and code enforcement personnel shall be authorized, within the corporate limits of the city, to enforce the orders, rules and regulations contained in this article and/or implemented by the mayor, city council or city manager during a declared emergency.
(c)
Penalties. Failure to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of the regulations contained in this article, or with any code section, order, rule or regulation made effective by the mayor, city council or city manager upon or after the declaration of an emergency shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this article.

Each person assisting in the commission of a violation shall be guilty of separate offenses. Each day during which a violation or failure to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation.
(d)
Injunctive relief. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-5, as amended, in addition to the remedies prescribed in this section, the city attorney is authorized to obtain an injunction to restrain violation of laws, code sections, orders, rules and regulations that are contained in the Georgia Emergency Management Act and/or this article, and/or are implemented by the mayor, city council or city manager during a declared emergency.
