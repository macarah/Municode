Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 10-3-2017 repealed former Art. VI, §§ 30-178—30-199, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 12-20-2005, §§ 1000-1—1000-22.

Sec. 30-178. - Purpose.
(a)
The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, signs can pose a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and can be a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. Accordingly, the mayor and council establish these regulations governing the display of signs to accomplish the following objectives:
(1)
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
(2)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs;
(3)
Restrict signs and lights that increase clutter or that increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision;
(4)
Promote signs compatible with surroundings; and
(5)
Insure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(b)
Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Demorest. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety.
(c)
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs enables the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, improves the general attractiveness of the community, takes advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and protects property values. Regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to emergencies.
(d)
Also, a purpose of this article is to insure proper maintenance for safety, structural soundness, and appearance of signs.
