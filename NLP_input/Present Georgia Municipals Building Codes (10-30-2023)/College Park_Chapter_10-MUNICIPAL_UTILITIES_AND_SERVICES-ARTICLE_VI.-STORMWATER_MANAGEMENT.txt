Sec. 10-141. - Authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to Official Code of Georgia Section 12-5-582(e)(1) and the grant of police powers to the City by Ga. L. 1895, p. 251, Sec. 14 and section 2-1 of the City Charter.
(Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 2, 4, 9-18-06)
Sec. 10-142. - Findings of fact.
The mayor and council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the city, and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters;
(2)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life;
(3)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff;
(4)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations;
(5)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management;
(6)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the municipal separate stormwater system; and
(7)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the municipal separate stormwater system.
(Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 2, 5, 9-18-06)
Sec. 10-143. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate stormwater system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law.

DIVISION 5. - STORMWATER UTILITY.

Sec. 10-170. - Findings.
The mayor and council of the City of College Park make the following findings:
(a)
Stormwater management is needed throughout the city limits. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within City of College Park is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(b)
Addressing the stormwater management needs in the city is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. The provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of City of College Park in a variety of ways.
(c)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, stream bank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the city's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk.
(d)
The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees.
(e)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge.
(f)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for Stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(g)
The City of College Park presently owns and operates stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for the city's stormwater management program's operating needs and capital.
(h)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the stormwater contribution from the property benefited by such systems.
(i)
As a result, the city's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the city's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in the city.

Except as provided in this section, no public or private property located in the city shall be exempt from stormwater service charges or receive a credit or offset against such stormwater service charges. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the tax status, economic status, race, religion, age or sex of the owner of the property being served, or based on any other condition unrelated to the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities. A stormwater service charge credit technical manual shall be prepared by the city engineer and approved by the city council specifying the design and performance standards of on-site and off-site privately owned and maintained stormwater systems, facilities, assets, services and activities that qualify for application of a credit, and how such credits shall be calculated.
(c)
Other developed land and groups of detached single-family dwelling units or improvements on other developed land which are developed as part of a common development plan which includes within the development, but not on the lots on which the detached single-family dwelling units or the improvements on other developed land are located, privately owned, maintained or operated stormwater control systems, facilities, assets, services or activities that reduce the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities, may receive a credit based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater service charge credit technical manual. The stormwater service charge credit for privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site stormwater control systems, facilities or assets that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property may be up to 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the property, and shall be proportional to the extent that such stormwater control systems, facilities or assets provided, operated and maintained by private persons may reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities. The credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities shall be proportional to the reduced costs realized by the city stormwater utility, but shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the person providing such services and activities, and shall not exceed 50 percent of the Stormwater service charge applicable to the subject property.
(d)
In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city engineer on forms provided for such purpose. When the city engineer deems an application for a credit complete, the city manager will then issue a decision granting the credit in whole or in part, or denying the credit within thirty (30) days thereafter. Credits applied for by the property owner in fiscal year 2008, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater service charges accruing in fiscal year 2008. Beginning July 1, 2008 credits applied for by the property owner, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply from the first day of the calendar month immediately following the date on which a complete application for the credit has been filed with the city.
(e)
A property owner shall not have to reapply annually for the credit granted, but the city engineer may review the credit and the basis therefore no more frequently than annually, and may terminate the credit if he finds grounds therefore. If such credit is terminated, the property owner may appeal such determination pursuant to section 10-175, or may, if possible, correct the deficiencies which caused the termination and reapply for the credit. A property owner with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, however, must submit the report prescribed in the NPDES permit to the city engineer to continue to receive the credit from the city associated with the NPDES permit.
(f)
Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this division.
(g)
Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that the city received the completed application.
(h)
A customer shall reapply every five (5) years for the credit granted, however, the city may terminate the credit if city finds the facility does not comply with the original approved credit application.
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 6-18-07)
Sec. 10-182. - Inspection of private facilities.
Continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards may be verified by the city's inspection of the systems or facilities upon which the credit is based. No credit shall be given under this article unless the property owner agrees in writing in its application that the city shall have the right for its designated officers, representatives, agents, and employees to enter upon private and public property, upon reasonable notice to the owner of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering testing, on such property in order to assure compliance with the design and performance standards and the applicant's credit application. On-site systems or facilities determined to no longer comply with the county's design and performance standards or the applicant's original credit application shall subject the property owner to revocation of all, or a portion of, stormwater service charge credits based on the city inspectors' estimate of capacity reduction for a period of not less than one (1) year.

Sec. 10-183. - Stormwater service charge, billing, delinquencies and collections.
(a)
The city is authorized to establish and/or utilize its own policies with respect to the billing and collection of the Stormwater utility service charge and the treatment of delinquent accounts. The Stormwater utility service charge may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other utility services provided by the city, at the city's sole discretion. The city is authorized to apply partial payments proportionately among the water, sewer, and stormwater fees charged by the city. The city is authorized to use existing city procedures for shutting off water with respect to non-payment.
(b)
Stormwater service charges shall begin to accrue July 1, 2007, and shall be billed in arrears.
(c)
Frequency of the billing of stormwater service charges shall be monthly unless otherwise specified by the city council. Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land subject to stormwater service charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater service charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater service charge payments. If a property owner is under billed, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed land, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the back billed period.

(b)
When the director determines that a public nuisance exists, the director shall send a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this ordinance exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The Director shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the Director shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors.
(c)
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required:
(1)
When the director determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property;
(2)
when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or
(3)
When notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record.
(d)
The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: Notice of Violation—Name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the Director that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this ordinance; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the City to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense.
(e)
Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with the city for a hearing before the director to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance.
(f)
Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Fulton/Clayton County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this mArticle, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.
