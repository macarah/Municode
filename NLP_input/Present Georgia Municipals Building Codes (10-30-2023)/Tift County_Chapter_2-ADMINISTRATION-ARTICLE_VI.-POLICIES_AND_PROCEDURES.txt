(a)
Complaints against an employee.

The board may conduct further investigation if it deems appropriate or necessary. Upon completion of review and investigation, the board shall discuss the complaint with the elected official against whom the complaint of sexual harassment is made. Such elected official shall be notified of the serious nature of the complaint and requested by the board of commissioners to cease any action which may be viewed as sexual harassment by any employee.
(Ord. of 10-14-96, § 7)
Sec. 2-382. - Duty of employees.
(a)
Employees are obligated to report instances of sexual harassment and to cooperate in every investigation of sexual harassment. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, coming forward with evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, to a person accused of sexual harassment, fully and truthfully making a written report or verbally answering questions when required to do so by an investigator during the course of an investigation of sexual harassment; and to refrain from making bad faith accusations of sexual harassment.
(b)
Disciplinary action may be taken against any employee who fails to report instances of sexual harassment, or who fails or refuses to cooperate in the investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment, or who files a complaint of sexual harassment in bad faith.
(c)
It is recognized that the question of whether a particular action or incident is a purely personal, social relationship without discriminatory employment effect, requires a factual determination based on all facts pertaining to the incident. Given the nature of this type of discrimination, it is further recognized that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause serious effects on innocent women and men. Accordingly, false accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The county trusts that all employees will continue to act responsibly to establish a pleasant working environment free of sexual harassment.

Sec. 2-397. - Policy.
(a)
Zero tolerance policy. Tift County maintains a "Zero Tolerance Policy" toward unauthorized drug or alcohol use or possession which could affect its workplace. The county does not discriminate against persons on the basis of an individual's medical history of addition to either drugs or alcohol, so long as there is no evidence or indication of the individual's current abuse of such substances, nor of the individual's violation of this policy, nor any history of criminal activity involving such use. This nondiscrimination policy shall not apply to any refusal to hire, or other discrimination against any individual who has been convicted of any crime. Except as otherwise permitted in this policy, the use, possession, concealment, transportation, promotion, or sale of any drugs, unauthorized alcoholic beverages, or other illicit or chemical substances or of any unauthorized items by any person on county premises is strictly prohibited. Because of the medical difficulty of determining the precise amount of any chemical substance which may cause intoxication or impair a person's mental, sensory, or emotional faculties, any use of drugs or illicit chemical substances away from county premises on a person's off duty time shall be treated as a violation of this policy if it leaves any detectable amounts of the substance within the person's bodily fluids when that individual is on county premises on duty. Persons found with such substances in their bodily fluids shall be considered unfit for duty and shall be removed from county premises, and shall be subject to immediate termination. Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under this policy or by signing any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory shall be grounds for refusal to hire or termination.
(b)
Duty regarding noncompliance. All managers, supervisors and employees shall have the duty to take whatever lawful steps are necessary in order to ensure the compliance with this policy by all persons who are on county premises. Any person who knowingly permits another person to violate this policy without informing a superior officer, manager, or supervisor, or without taking other action to prevent such a violation shall be subject to discipline, including termination.
(c)
Prescription drugs. Prescription drugs may be utilized by persons on county premises only under the following conditions:
(1)
All prescription medicines must be stored in their original pharmacy container. No person may possess a prescription drug that is more than one year old. Employees whose medical conditions require the use of a syringe for the administration of insulin, or other medically-required substances must comply with the notification provisions set forth in subparagraph (c)(2).
(2)
All persons using prescription drugs which are mood altering, mind or consciousness-affecting, or which are likely to have any effect upon the individual's perceptions, sensations, thought processes, self-awareness, emotions, or other mental or physical reactions or behavior while working shall inform their immediate supervisor of the name of the drug, the name of the prescribing physician, the date of the prescription, and the condition for which the medicine was prescribed, and shall execute, upon request, a release permitting the prescribing physician to release to the county's personnel director such information as is required to confirm that the employee is fit for duty and is in compliance with this policy.
(3)
The county reserves the right at all times to require that such persons submit to an examination by the county's medical review officer, and to rely upon the advice, findings, or conclusions of the medical review officer in determining whether the individual is fit for duty.
(d)
Drug testing. No drug test shall be administered to a candidate until after a job offer has been made to the candidate. No candidate to whom a job offer has been made shall be permitted to begin working until the candidate has taken and has passed a drug and alcohol screening test. All candidates shall be tested through urinalysis or other means for the presence of alcohol, drugs, or other illicit chemical substances in their bodily fluids. Any candidate who refuses to submit to such a test, or whose tests reveal the presence of such chemical substances shall not be considered for employment.
(e)
Positive results. No test of any specimen found to be positive (i.e., indicating the presence of alcohol, drugs, or an illicit chemical substance) or which is suspected of having been adulterated, tampered with in the initial test, shall be considered conclusive unless it is first subjected to a second confirming test or analytic procedure used to identify the alcohol, drug or specific metabolite, using a different scientific principle from that employed in the initial test procedure. The confirming test shall be performed by a certified laboratory, and must be made using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method, or an equivalent test method which must provide the requisite specificity sensitivity and quantitative accuracy which is at least equal to that of the GC/MS method, and must also be approved by NIDA, as such testing technology becomes available.
(f)
Possession. Except as otherwise permitted in this policy, any person found to be in possession of drugs, alcohol, or other illicit chemical substances (other than in the person's bodily fluids) while on county premises, shall be terminated, if employed by the county.
(g)
Searches and inspections for possession. The county reserves the right at all times on county premises, where it concludes circumstances which warrant such action, to conduct searches and inspections of employees and other persons for the purpose of determining whether such persons are in possession of, using, transporting, or concealing any of the prohibited substances or items covered by this policy; this shall include employee's lockers, baggage, desks, work areas, lunch boxes, brief cases, clothing, and vehicles (whether owned by the county or by the employee when the vehicle is located on county premises) using supervisors, managers, or authorized search and inspection specialists. Any evidence revealed in such a search will be utilized only for purposes of enforcing this policy, and will not be used by the county in any criminal prosecution of the employee.
(h)
Unannounced testing. A search and inspection as defined in this policy may also include the requirement that employees and others submit to an unannounced urine drug screen test or blood plasma test, and also may include testing the individual's urine, breath, or blood for the presence of any of the prohibited substances or items covered by this policy. These tests may be utilized in the following circumstances:
(1)
In employment medical examinations (before a candidate to whom an offer of employment has been extended begins working);
(2)
As part of an overall search and inspection of an employee's working area, department, or work location as park of the county enforcement of this policy, or as part of a random drug testing program as set forth in this policy;
(3)
When an employee's supervisor has reasonable suspicion or cause to suspect that an employee is using, or has used, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substances in violation of this policy, or is under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or other illicit chemical substances, based on objective and describable facts which would lead a reasonably prudent supervisor to believe that the employee is under the influence of an illicit chemical substance, or that the employee has otherwise violated this policy;
(4)
When a person is found to be in possession of suspected illicit chemical substances, or when any of these substances or unauthorized items are found in an area which is controlled or used exclusively by the person;
(5)
Following an accident, a serious work quality error apparently due to an employee's inattentiveness or serious judgment or perception error, an incident where safety precautions were violated, or whenever an employee has caused, contributed to the cause, or suffered an injury requiring medical attention or lost working time for any person, or where damage to property has resulted from an employee's job performance;
(6)
As part of follow-up fitness for duty drug screening following reinstatement of an employee to duty following treatment of substance or alcohol abuse;
(7)
An employee who submits to a drug screening test is entitled upon request, and at his sole expense, to have a portion of the urine or blood specimen submitted for testing to any other NIDA-certified laboratory which the county recognizes as having the competence, reliability, and expertise needed to perform an accurate analysis to determine the presence of such illicit chemical substances and to preserve and document the custody of the sample. The employee must make the request for the independent test not later than five working days after receipt of the written report of the test results, pursuant to subparagraph(h)(8) below;
(8)
An employee will be notified in writing within five working days of the county's (or its medical review officer's) receipt of a written report revealing a positive test result. The employee will also be notified, not later than five working days of his receipt of the written positive test result notification, of his right to contest or explain the positive test results to the county's medical review officer. If requested by an employee or job candidate, the county will provide a copy of the test results to the employee. The employee will be reminded that if the sample he provided for testing was sufficient, he may, at his own expense, request a second confirmation test of a portion of the remaining sample by an NIDA-approved laboratory of the employee's choosing (provided the county recognizes the laboratory as equally competent with the laboratories it ordinarily uses for such tests).
(9)
Both the initial screen test and the first confirmation test will be made at the county's sole expense.
(h.1)
Employees shall be subject to a random selection process whereby employees will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection method shall be scientifically valid and give each employee an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Under this program at least 50 percent of the county's employees will be subject to drug testing each calendar year, and at least 25 percent of the county's employees will be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year. An employee who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns alcohol may not resume driving duties without first passing an alcohol test. An employee who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns controlled substances may not resume driving duties without first passing a controlled substances test. An employee who has completed drug rehabilitation or a recommended course of treatment for alcohol abuse under this policy shall, upon resumption of duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of 12 to 60 months and shall include at least six unannounced tests during the first 12 months of his/her return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the county's human resources director, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six tests under this provision. For drivers of county vehicles, each such unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either just before the driver is to perform driving duties or just after the driver has finished performing driving duties. Unannounced testing for alcohol for other employees, and unannounced testing for controlled substances may be performed at any time during the work day for all employees.
(i)
Searches and inspections without prior notice. Searches (including urine drug screening or blood and plasma sampling) and inspections by investigate specialists or county supervisors may be conducted from time to time without prior notice to the employee. However, due consideration will be shown for the privacy interests of persons on county premises, subject to the objectives, and within the parameters of this policy. Evidence revealed in such searches (including drug screening or blood plasma sampling) will be utilized solely for purposes of enforcing this drug-free workplace policy, and will not be used in any criminal proceeding against the employee.
(j)
Written consent; refusal. No person's body shall be searched, nor will any urine or blood and plasma drug screening test be administered without the written consent of the person being searched or tested. Any employee who refuses to provide such consent when requested, or to submit to a urine or blood plasma drug screening test, or to a search, or who is found to be in possession of such illicit chemical substances or unauthorized items shall be subject to termination. Any other person who refuses to submit to a search or a urine or blood and plasma drug screening test when requested pursuant to this policy will be barred from employment with the county, or from conducting business with the county and, where appropriate, may be excluded or removed from county premises and will not be permitted to return.
(k)
Voluntary self-referral to EAP.
(1)
The ultimate responsibility for eliminating addition or chemical dependency is solely that of the person affected by it. Nevertheless, the county's policy shall be to encourage employees with additive disorders or chemical dependency to seek proper medical and/or psychological treatment for the disease. It shall cooperate with the employee in obtaining such treatment, to the extent possible and within the limits of the county's medical insurance policy, medical leave of absence policy, and other benefit policies (including any employee assistance program that the county may maintain). The personnel director shall be responsible for informing such an addicted to employee of the programs, resources and benefits which are currently available for treatment for such a condition.
(2)
No employee shall be terminated, disciplined, nor suffer any adverse employment action solely because he/she has sought referral to a county-provided benefit program for treatment of alcohol or substance abuse, or otherwise for having identified himself or herself as having a chemical addition or dependence, provided that the employee seeks the assistance in obtaining proper treatment for such addition or dependency before either testing positive or before the employee is involved in an incident (e.g. an accident or other behavior suggesting reasonable cause for suspecting the employee is impaired) which would ordinarily result in a search or testing under this policy.
(3)
No employee who identifies himself or herself as being in need of such assistance before an incident leading to detection occurs shall suffer any discrimination in any term or condition of employment, including promotion and transfer opportunities solely because of his or her disclosure of such a condition, so long as the employee seeks such assistance and adheres to the treatment plan prescribed by his or her physician or other competent medical, psychological, or addiction counselor, and remains free of the illicit chemical substance, and so long as the employee is otherwise eligible, qualified, and entitled to the position. No employee who has successfully completed a drug or alcohol addiction treatment program shall be subject to any adverse or discriminatory treatment solely for having participated in such program so long as the individual remains drug and alcohol-free and otherwise complies with all the terms and conditions of this policy. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any individual to whom the provision of subsection (l) applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the requirement that an employee who has returned to duty following completion of a drug or alcohol treatment program submit to more frequent unscheduled drug screening tests as a means of ensuring the employee's continued compliance with this program shall not be considered "adverse" or "discriminatory" treatment.
(l)
Mandatory referral to EAP in lieu of termination. The provisions of this section shall apply only to persons who are already county employees. It shall not apply to any candidate failing the post-employment offer, pre-employment drug screening test, nor any persons who have resigned or retired from county employment.
(1)
If any urine or blood plasma drug screening test reveals the presence of an illicit chemical substance in an employee's bodily fluids, the personnel director shall have the option (but not the obligation) in the first instance of such an occurrence, to refer the employee to the county's employment assistance program for assessment and treatment, if needed, at the sole expense of the employee. Such EAP referral shall be available only one time on a "last chance" basis. Any subsequent incident involving the use or possession of illicit chemical substances or materials under this policy will result in the employee's termination.
(2)
To be eligible for such mandatory referral the employee shall be required to execute a consent and release permitting the personnel director to monitor the employee's participation and progress in any treatment or therapy program recommended by the EAP counselors.
(3)
If the employee refuses to enter into such a program, or having once entered, fails to complete the program as directed by the addiction counselor, psychologist, or physician, the employee shall be terminated.
(4)
If the employee successfully completes the treatment program and returns to work, he or she shall be subject to further unannounced drug screening tests not less than annually, as the personnel director determines is advisable under all the circumstances, for a period of not less than two years.
(5)
The record of the particular incident which led to the drug screening test, shall not be used against the employee in a future decision if the employee successfully completed the treatment prescribed and maintains drug free status thereafter, and does not violate this policy.
(6)
No person shall receive the benefits of this section more than one time, nor be excused from discipline or termination under the county's behavior and performance standards and policies merely because the employee's behavior or performance problem was caused by the employee's illicit chemical substance abuse.
(m)
Confidentiality. All records of drug and alcohol screening tests results, all referral to or participation in the employee assistance program, and of any treatment for addictive disorders or diseases shall be maintained as strictly confidential employee personnel information which shall not be revealed to any person other than the personnel director, and those managers or supervisors having the need to know such information, the county's attorney's and the appropriate EAP counselor. Such information shall not be revealed under any circumstances to any other persons, employers, or prospective employers in any employment reference checks, nor to any other agencies, persons, or organizations unless the county is compelled by statute, regulation, or court order to reveal such information to such persons or organizations, or to defend itself in an action growing out of its enforcement of this policy.
(n)
Authorized use of alcohol. Although Tift County does not encourage or condone the use of alcohol, moderate use of authorized alcoholic beverages (as defined above) during an individual's nonworking hours, in strict compliance with this policy and with all state and local laws and ordinances, and in a manner which ensures both that the individual will not be impaired when driving a county vehicle, nor when reporting to work, and that the individual is in compliance with prudent safety practices, will not be considered a violation of this policy.
(o)
Education program.
(1)
Employees. On not less than a biannual basis, every employee shall receive at least one hour of training on substance abuse in general, and its effects in the workplace including, but not limited to, the following:
a.
The explanation of the disease model of addiction for alcohol and drugs;
b.
The effects and dangers of the commonly abused substances in the workplace; and
c.
The county's policies and procedures regarding substance abuse affecting the workplace, including how employees can obtain treatment for substance abuse.
(2)
Supervisors. In addition to the education provided to employees, all supervisors will receive at least two hours of training which shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
a.
How to recognize signs of employee substance abuse;
b.
How to document and corroborate signs of employee substance abuse; and
c.
How to refer substance abusing employees to the proper treatment providers through the county's employee assistance program.
(p)
Severability. If any of the provisions of Tift County's policies and procedures on substance abuse, contraband articles, and employee assistance shall be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect nor impair any of the remaining provisions.
