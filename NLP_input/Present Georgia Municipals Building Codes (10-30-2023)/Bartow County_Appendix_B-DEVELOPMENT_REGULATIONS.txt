( Ord. of 4-15-2015, § I )
Sec. 1.8. - These regulations not zoning.
These development regulations are not a zoning ordinance, but any proposed developer or sub-divider is advised to ensure that the proposed development or subdivision is in compliance with the requirements of the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A).

(2)
Any division of land for the purposes of legacy, which is defined as a transaction between immediate family members (parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, great grandparents, great grandchildren), as approved by the county engineer.
(3)
Certain developments may be exempt from these requirements if the project area being developed is comprised of less than one acre and/or is not located within 200 feet of any state waters.

Recognizing that not all subdivision requirements are logical or affordable for large lot subdivisions, subdivision of land in the A-1 agriculture district into large lots (meaning where all lots are ten acres or greater in size) may be granted, upon approval of the county engineer, without requiring a preliminary plat before approval of a final plat. The county engineer is authorized to determine that the following development regulations either shall not apply or may be reduced from the stated requirement for large lot residential subdivisions: road right-of-way dedication (section 5.31(10)), connection to public water (section 3.1(6)), and/or stormwater management requirements (Code chapter 34, section 34-555). In order to eliminate or reduce such regulations, the county engineer must make a determination in writing that the proposed reduction or elimination is consistent with the spirit and intent of the code, will not harm the public interest or adjacent property, and is in the best interests of the county. Any such approved modification shall be noted on the final plat to provide public record of the fact that existing regulations have been varied or reduced for the particular large lot residential development.

ARTICLE III. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Apr. 15, 2015, § III, deleted the former Art. III, §§ 3.1—3.9, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to campground standards and derived from an ordinance adopted Nov. 9, 2005(1).

Sec. 3.1. - Generally.
When someone desires to conduct land-disturbing activities, it is necessary to submit site construction documents for review. Bartow County generally does not require a land disturbance permit for individual residential building lots. However, all other forms of land disturbing activities do require such permits. For the purposes of determining compliance with certain provisions of these regulations, redevelopment means "a land development project on a previously developed site, but excludes ordinary maintenance activities, remodeling of existing buildings, resurfacing of paved areas, and exterior changes or improvements which do not materially increase or concentrate stormwater runoff, or cause additional nonpoint source pollution."
The engineering division of the community development department coordinates the review and approval process for all site construction documents submitted to Bartow County for permitting under this section. It is important that all information requested on the application for plan review is completed. The failure to complete or provide all information may result in delays and/or the requirement of re-submittal of an application. Acceptance of plans by Bartow County shall not constitute or guarantee any rights unless such plans are prepared in accordance with the development regulation. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the plans. In the event an application is determined by staff to contain false or misleading information, any permit issued hereunder may be revoked or suspended with penalties assessed. For permitting a structure, a structural plan submittal is necessary as provided in section 18-161 of the Building Code for Bartow County. Additionally, it is advisable that an applicant obtains a water and/or sewer availability letter prior to commencing the permitting process.
Approval of plans by Bartow County officials or employees shall not imply nor transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, architecture, landscape architecture or any other profession, from the professional corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared and sealed.
In any development or subdivision in this county, the improvements, facilities, and utilities described in this article shall be planned for and provided by the developer, by installation and/or payment prior to the approval of the development or manufactured house park. In addition, all development or subdivision in this county must comply with the following requirements, as applicable:
(1)
Relevant ordinances and construction plans. Any person wishing to develop or redevelop commercial, industrial or multi-family property, or subdivide residential, commercial, or industrial property, must submit construction plans (with hydrology), that also comply with the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, the Bartow County Floodplain Management/Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, and the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Ordinance.
(2)
Interdepartmental review and approval. The community development department shall not issue a permit for any development activities until all plats and construction plans, as applicable, have been approved by the development review committee as may have authority or jurisdiction over said activities in whole or in part.
(3)
Review of plats and plans required. All preliminary plats, concept plans, construction plans and final plats must be submitted to the development review committee for review and approval prior to the commencement of land disturbance or construction activities. All information requested on plan transmittal applications for plat or plan review must be provided; incomplete applications will not be accepted. Likewise all plats and plans must contain the minimum information outlined in this article. The absence of necessary design data shall result in plats and plans being resubmitted for a future plan review date.
(4)
Review by departments. The community development department shall oversee communication with reviewing departments during the two-week review period regarding review comments prior to a development control review meeting. There is the possibility of delaying approvals if the Natural Resource Conservation Service warrants an extended review period.
(5)
Paved streets. The developer/subdivider of any development or redevelopment or subdivision shall provide adequate streets and shall pave said streets according to minimum requirements (including appropriate width) as provided in these regulations. No subdivision shall be permitted on an unpaved street.
(6)
Public water required. All residential developments must be connected to a governmentally-owned public water system, at the expense of the developer, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bartow County Water Department, including the Water Service and Conservation Ordinance (Code section 74-31 et seq.), and the Sewer System Ordinance (Code section 75-251 et seq.), and including the Water Department Development Procedures.
(7)
Street names. The developer shall submit the names of streets and developments for approval by the county in accordance with these regulations certifying that the proposed names are not confusingly similar to other existing named streets or developments. The decision of the county approving or disapproving the proposed names shall be final.
( Ord. of 4-15-2015, § III )
Sec. 3.2. - Submittal process.
It shall be the policy of Bartow County to review development proposals for compliance with the standards adopted by the Bartow County Commissioner. This policy shall also include performing this review in a timely manner so as not to delay development. In order to enhance operational efficiency of this policy it is imperative that developers thoroughly familiarize themselves with all the pertinent Bartow County Subdivision and Development policies, regulations and standards. The one stop development review process provides the development community the opportunity to meet with representatives from each agency/department/division prior to the production of construction documents in order to obtain data critical to the design of the project. A pre-application conference shall be scheduled in accordance with subsection 3.2.2.

A list of the staff members of the development review committee that assist in the review and approval of the site design plans is maintained by the community development department. Each County agency/department/division involved in the review and approval process can provide a list of data required to complete compliance with the development standards (also referred to as checklists).
(K)
The applicant is responsible for submitting a set of plans to the appropriate utility department of each municipality as applicable.
(3)
Construction plan review conference. Each project submitted for review shall be allotted a 30-minute appointment for the date and time assigned for review before the development review committee. If a developer, engineer, surveyor or landscape architect has several projects for review on the same week, an effort will be made to schedule contiguous appointments for his or her convenience. However, appointment times are scheduled on a first come-first served basis. Only those projects scheduled well in advance may be so scheduled. Comments and recommendations will be discussed during the scheduled meeting. Should any agency/department/division determine insufficient information, detail, or design is provided; a project may be required to be re-submitted for a later date. Once documents are re-submitted, an appointment will be scheduled.
(4)
Project approval. Following completion of the construction plan review conference, an individual shall be required to incorporate all comments and recommendations into a revised set of construction plans. Bartow County offers two approval process methods by which a land disturbance permit may be obtained. These are the one stop approval conference and walk-through approval. Both of these are described below. Under either method, eight sets of amended site construction plans must be presented to the individual county agency/department/division for approval and sign-off. Additionally, two copies of the amended hydrology study must be submitted to the engineering division. The amended plans must be accompanied by the red-line "Plan Review Copy" of the plans and by the package of comments returned by each agency/department/divisions. Additionally, the agency/department/division shall evidence its approval by signature on the plans. Should these projects fall outside the jurisdictional boundaries of a Bartow County Agency/Department/Division such as water, or sewer, those jurisdictions' approval must be shown on the face of the documents. Upon receiving approval from all agencies/departments/divisions and affected outside jurisdictions, the applicant is granted a land disturbance permit. Eight sets of amended site construction plans and two copies of the stormwater management plan shall be presented for approval.
(A)
One stop approval conference. The one stop development procedure provides the opportunity to obtain the signatures of all agency/department/division representatives at one location at a specified time. Requests for appointments for the resubmittal Conference may be made with the community development department no later than 12:00 p.m. on Friday of the preceding week. Appointment times will be scheduled on a first come, first serve basis. Appointments will be confirmed between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Monday for appointments scheduled for the following Thursday. The following information will be necessary at the time the request is made for an appointment:
(1)
Project name and Bartow County project number (assigned during the review process).
(2)
Name of contact and telephone number for confirmation.
(3)
Name of person to attend the approval conference.
Appointments will be assigned in 15-minute increments. Some waiting may be anticipated depending on the scope and scale of the projects scheduled earlier. It is important that all parties adhere to the scheduled times to minimize the time necessary to obtain the permit once the plans have begun to be processed. Applicants should make every effort to provide all pertinent information to staff as needed; otherwise this creates delays in the approval process. Cancellations or postponements may require that the plans be approved at a later date by each agency/department/division. This will require each individual agency/department/division to review and approve plans by scheduled appointments only.
(B)
Walk-through approval. Projects that are large in scope, those that require specific impact studies, and those that contain environmental, historical, or archaeologically sensitive areas are not normally appropriate for the one stop approval conference. (However, these projects may be scheduled if all agencies/departments/divisions are satisfied that all requirements have been met for construction to be permitted. Every attempt will be made to ensure that no project will be scheduled for the resubmittal conference that has not met these requirements.) It is the responsibility of the party seeking final approval to ensure that these conditions have been satisfied. For walk-through approvals, appointments should be scheduled with each individual agency/department/division on any business day.
(C)
The community development department will issue a conditional land disturbance permit letter for the project upon successfully obtaining the final approval of the development review committee. Once all required documentation, including bonds and/or letters of credit, preconstruction certifications, a copy of the NPDES notice of intent (NOI) ensuring compliance with the state general permit and appropriate permit fees have be submitted to the community development department, the development permit will be delivered to the project site by the department's development inspector at the time of the scheduled pre-construction meeting as required in these regulations.
(D)
Construction plan approval binding one year. Approval of the site construction plans shall be effective and binding upon the county for a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval and shall thereafter expire and be null and void except to the extent that work on the project has progressed, unless a request for an extension of time has been submitted to and is subsequently approved by the community development department. Land disturbing activities under this permit must commence within 120 days after issuance of permit. Failure to begin work may be cause for the permit to be canceled. Once a permit has been canceled, it cannot be reactivated for any reason. A new set of construction plans must be submitted in accordance with these regulations when the applicant is ready to begin land disturbance.
(5)
Required documentation prior to issuance of permit; sureties. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the county to the developer until a surety or sureties have been furnished to the engineering division, in forms acceptable to the county (bond, cash deposit, or escrow account) for the various requirements of this ordinance. The county's preference shall be for irrevocable standby letters of credit. Such irrevocable letter of credit must be issued in conformant with the latest ICC Publication governing irrevocable standby letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank or other financial institution with a physical branch in Bartow County (unless this requirement is waived by the concurrence of county engineer and county attorney). Said letter of credit shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, in a form acceptable to Bartow County. Bartow County reserves the right to reject any proffered irrevocable letter of credit and require a surety bond. Bartow County Engineering Division may, at its discretion, agree to accept surety bond in lieu of an irrevocable letter of credit. Said bond must be in a form acceptable to Bartow County. If the applicant prefers a cash escrow deposit, that will be accepted, with the proceeds being deposited in a separate Bartow County-controlled bank account for the duration of the surety. See Section 6.142 for the method to calculate the amount of surety required in this section.
The purpose of the sureties shall be any or all of the following, depending on the particular development: 1) to secure performance of the erosion and sedimentation control work in compliance with county regulations; 2) to ensure proper construction of roads, stormwater facilities and other improvements that are to be dedicated to the county in new developments; 3) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way; 4) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any new road or work in any existing county right-of-way.
All original preconstruction certifications shall be submitted to the engineering division prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit.
(A)
E&S surety. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County, an original irrevocable letter of credit in an amount as set forth by the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. Said irrevocable letter of credit is for guaranty of soil erosion and sedimentation best management practices (BMPs). The letter of credit shall remain in force until all final stabilization erosion and sedimentation control measures are in place. Once erosion and sedimentation control BMPs are complete, and the site is stabilized, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, authorize a release of the required letter of credit. If the developer does not comply with these regulations or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the irrevocable letter of credit or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to install soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures.

(1)
Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a performance and maintenance bond or an irrevocable standby letter of credit. The surety must be accepted and approved by the county engineer before the LDP can issue.
(2)
Purpose. The purpose of the surety shall be any or all of the following, depending on the particular development: 1) to secure performance of the erosion and sedimentation control work in compliance with county regulations; 2) to ensure proper construction of roads in new developments; 3) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way; 4) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any new road or work in any existing county right-of-way; 5) to provide funds for repair of damage to any existing county roads, including roads contained in earlier phases of the same development, caused by construction traffic in the new development.
(3)
Approval. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by Bartow County. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by Bartow County prior to issuance. Bartow County has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the county engineer prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Publication 590, International Standby Practices "ISP98," and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch within Bartow County or with a headquarters or branch in Georgia within 100 miles of Bartow County, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. Bartow County reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from a developer that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. Bartow County reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Cash is not an acceptable form of surety.
(4)
Scope. In each case, the surety guarantees that all applicable provisions of any Bartow County ordinances are complied with, including but not limited to, the erosion and sedimentation control ordinance, these development regulations, the utility accommodation ordinance, Bartow County standard road details, and the regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing.
(5)
Amount and term. The amount of the surety depends on the project, and shall be set by the county engineer relying on experience with similar projects and the developer, knowledge of material and labor costs, and investigation of additional costs. The amount shall be sufficient to secure performance of the work and compliance with the county ordinances and regulations. Depending on the elements of the project, the amount can include one or more of the following: 1) For security of erosion and sedimentation control work, the amount shall be sufficient to permanently stabilize the entire project, at a minimum of $3,000.00 per acre of the property to be disturbed. 2) For road work on new roads, the amount shall be sufficient to grade, base and pave all new roads called for on the plans, at a rate to be determined by Bartow County and such rate may be revised from time to time as deemed necessary by the county engineer to reflect current construction costs; the amount shall also be sufficient to pay for associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls. 3) For work in existing county rights-of-way, the amount shall be sufficient to ensure repair of the roads after any planned work, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls, that are part of the project being approved; the minimum amount shall be $25,000.00. 4) For multi-phased developments where construction traffic is traveling through subdivision roads already accepted by the county, the minimum amount shall be $10,000.00 per 0.1 miles (i.e, 1/10 th of a mile) of county-owned subdivision road being crossed by the construction traffic. The foregoing amounts are minimums and can be increased based on a more complex or expensive project, difficult terrain or other factors that would make the remedial work more expensive. No additional separate amount of surety shall be required for maintenance purposes. The term of any surety shall extend for the period from the issuance of the LDP until the project or development is completed, and additionally beyond that for the duration of any applicable warranty and maintenance period.
(6)
Partial release. Once erosion and sedimentation control BMPs are complete, and the site is finally stabilized, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, authorize a release of the portion of the surety relating to E&S work. Once a new roadway or roadways have had final "as-built certificates" issued and they have been dedicated and accepted, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, release a portion of the surety amount relating to the new roads; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once a project within an existing county right-of-way has been completed and inspected, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, release a portion of the surety amount relating to the work in the existing right-of-way; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once the applicable maintenance period has passed, the remaining surety amount shall be released. In the event there are no new roads nor any work in the county right-of-way that require a warranty period, the surety shall be released upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(7)
Prerequisite; calling surety. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the county until the surety has been furnished to the county, in a form acceptable to the county. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable Bartow County ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work.
(8)
Waiver. The county engineer shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the county.

Sec. 3.31. - Special district assessments.
(1)
Purpose and Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority of Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution of 1983, authorizing the County to create special districts by ordinance to provide local government services and to provide for assessments to pay for such services. This section is intended to address the problems created by failed subdivisions where the original developer has dissolved, gone bankrupt, or otherwise lost ownership before completing the roads and streets, paving and sidewalks, stormwater, detention, ponds, water and sewer or other infrastructure within the development to the required standards of these development regulations; or when the original developer has failed to complete the final wearing surface of the roads within five years of final plat recording; or when the original developer has performed substandard work and there is no maintenance bond; or otherwise created other problems with roads, sidewalks, utility infrastructure, stormwater structures, drainage, ponds, dams or other structures and is no longer available to repair such problems. In compliance with the Development Impact Fee Act (O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.), only project improvements (as defined below) shall be constructed under this section. However, in any conflict between authority exercised under the above-cited paragraph of the Constitution and the Development Impact Fee Act, the Constitution shall control.
(2)
Creation. There is hereby created a special district pursuant to Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution of 1983 for purposes of correcting, finishing or repairing a particular development's internal streets and roads and related water, sewer, and storm water infrastructure, for each subdivision or development that requires project improvements, provided all of the following occur:
(A)
The community development director certifies in writing to the Bartow County Commissioner that a residential subdivision has been lawfully final platted in the unincorporated county; that more than five lots have been sold by the original developer and homes are erected and certificates of occupancy have been issued on such lots; that the original developer no longer owns the development and there is no successor developer who can provide appropriate surety for completion of the roads or other infrastructure (or that the successor developer has failed or refused to do so). The community development director shall further certify that work is necessary to provide correction of problems with roads, stormwater structures, etc., or that the original developer has not placed the final wearing surface on the roads within five years of final plat recording, or that all or a portion of the roads and streets (and other related stormwater or other community infrastructure) shown on the final plat do not comply with these development regulations; and that adequate funds or surety for proper completion of the roadways and infrastructure within the residential development was not obtained or has not been honored or otherwise received.
(B)
The community development director shall also provide the cost of constructing all project improvements to bring the development into compliance with the development regulations and/or repair any problems or deficiencies, and provides a cost per vacant lot of constructing such necessary improvements. Any partial amounts received from surety or maintenance bonds available and received related to the subdivision shall be credited against the assessment figure before the per-lot fee is calculated.
(C)
The county commissioner adopts a resolution designating the subdivision as a special district under this section and approves the construction of the necessary street and related improvements and the implementation of the assessment to recover the costs, such assessment to be imposed only on lots meeting the definition of vacant lots as of the date of the adoption of the commissioner's resolution. Such district can be created either before the work is performed or after the work is performed.
(3)
Construction and Assessment. Upon creation of the special district, the county shall be authorized to impose the assessment on each vacant lot in the subdivision. The building inspections division shall collect the assessment at the time of issuance of a building permit. This fee shall be in addition to and separate from regular building permit fees, water and sewer tap fees, and any other fees required by the Code of Bartow County and regulations adopted thereunder.
(4)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
(A)
Project improvement means site improvements required to provide all the street, road, stormwater, sewer, water or other utility or infrastructure improvements within the right-of-way or serving a specifically identified residential development that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants of the development and necessary to bring the development into compliance with the standards set forth in the Bartow County Development Regulations or other applicable laws and agreements. Such street, road and utility improvements include, but are not limited to, streets, roads, sidewalks, curb and gutter, and associated utility improvements in the right-of-way such as storm water structures, sewer manholes, water and sewer lateral connections and similar items. Such term can also mean improvements made necessary to repair substandard work or to repair other problems to the roads, sidewalks, curb and gutter, stormwater structures, drainage infrastructure, ponds, dams and other related appurtenances.
(B)
Vacant lot means a lot within a residential subdivision for which no certificate of occupancy (C.O.) has been issued by the county, or for which a C.O. has been revoked. This shall include lots with foundations or partially built homes.
(5)
Restrictions.
(A)
Assessments collected under this section shall be spent only on the specific project improvements necessary for the specific development designated as a special district.
(B)
It is not intended that this section be used to provide upgrades to a subdivision that were not called for in the original plat (for example, providing sidewalks where none were called for by the plat) but minor improvements necessitated by changing conditions or new information but not shown on the final plat (for example, an additional storm drain) can be included as a project improvement.
(C)
Once sufficient assessments have been collected to equal to the cost of construction of the project improvements, the assessments shall be lifted.

In residential subdivisions without sewer, but where curb and gutter are required, the developer shall have the option of placing the final wearing surface before recording of the final plat, or waiting to place the final wearing surface until after 80 percent build out of all lots in the subdivision, but in the latter case, a letter of credit for the road improvements (at a rate determined by the County Engineer) shall be required. See subsection 5.28(e) for requirements.
d.
Five Year Limitation. In no event shall the final wearing surface be placed later than five years after the recording of the final plat.
e.
For all commercial and industrial projects paving shall be completed and final wearing surface applied prior to issuance of any certificates of occupancy. Specifications for plant mix asphalt shall be as follows: 1) any plant mix asphalt must comply with GDOT guidelines for the appropriate road or street; 2) all streets shall have a minimum thickness of two inches of "B" mix and one and one half inches of "E" mix. See Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development for base requirements and complete roadway cross-section specifications.
(7)
Drainage at low points. Drainage of roadway shall be provided at low points through weep holes to catch basins (see Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development).
(8)
Right-of-way erosion control. Rights-of-way and road shoulders shall be graded, grassed, and/or re-grassed until sufficient ground cover is achieved.
(9)
Final inspection; acceptance. After the road or street has been completed and as-built certified by the engineer of record (see subsection 5.31(14)), the county engineer must perform a final inspection of all paving, drainage and any other aspects related to future maintenance of the road or street. Provided all criteria are met, including final wearing surface having been applied, the county shall officially accept the "roadway as-built certificate." After this point, provided the roadway is to be a public street, the roadway shall be dedicated to the county. The developer shall cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to the county with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by the county of the roadways and associated infrastructure improvements. Upon acceptance of said road or street, the same shall be open to the general public at all times subject only to any restrictions placed upon it by the county. The county shall not be required to accept the dedication until all criteria of these regulations (including application of final wearing surface) are met.
(10)
Construction warnings. The developer shall furnish and maintain all necessary barricades and warning signs in the right-of-way while roadway frontage improvements are being made.
(11)
Warranty and maintenance period. Roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways, except for roadways with sanitary sewer, in which case the warranty period shall extend two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. Work in an existing county right-of-way (for example, access for a new development) shall be warranted for a period of two years. In all cases, the warranty period begins to run on the date the commissioner accepts the deed of dedication by resolution at a public hearing. The warranty shall mean that if the road fails within the warranty period, the road shall be repaired by the permit holder, or else the county shall call the surety to pay for the repair. Road failures include dips in the surface, raveling, potholes, and any other defect that means the road does not meet the standards of county regulations, as determined solely by the county. The surety required by subsection 5.28(e) shall remain in effect the applicable warranty period to secure maintenance. See also subsection 5.31(16).

Sec. 5.31. - Street design.
modified
The following criteria and requirements are applicable to all street design plans and street designs, in all developments and subdivisions:
(1)
Road plan. Developer must provide road plan and profiles for all streets in the development design.
(2)
Intersection angle. All streets must intersect with other streets at a 90 degree angle.
(3)
Multiple entrances. A maximum number of 150 residential dwelling units shall be allowed with only one street outlet to an existing public road. The second entrance location and design must be approved by county engineer and community development department. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the county engineer, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed. However, such single entrance must be designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the county engineer and community development department. In such cases, a "knockdown" gate-type second entrance (that is, a gate designed to discourage routine access but able to be knocked down by an emergency vehicle) shall be provided for emergency vehicle access, accessing at least a gravel drive connecting to an interior street.
(4)
Intersection radii. The curb or pavement radii at intersections shall not be less than 25 feet.
(5)
Grades. Street grades shall not be less than 1.5 percent grade nor more than 15 percent grade.
(6)
Sight distance. Intersection sight distance (not to be confused with stopping sight distance) shall be measured from centerline of each proposed intersecting entrance street or driveway. See additional design criteria in Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. Intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed height of drivers eye of 3.50 feet and an assumed height of object of 4.25 feet when measuring in the vertical plane. When measuring in the horizontal plane, the intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed driver's eye location of ten feet from edge of pavement of the main street on the centerline of the intersecting street and an object location on the centerline of the main street. When measuring in either plane, the line of sight must remain in the proposed dedicated ROW, unless the designer provides a plan showing unimpeded line of sight. Intersection sight distance for internal subdivision streets shall not be less than 200 feet.
(7)
Curve radii. Horizontal curve radii at street centerline shall be not less than 200 feet for streets intersecting with county roads and 100 feet for all other streets. A minimum of 100 feet of tangent must be provided between reverse curves and a minimum of 50 feet of tangent must be provided on intersecting streets.
(8)
Intersections. All intersections with existing county roads must be approved by the community development department. Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be installed as required by the community development department or engineering department. Determination of whether such lanes are required shall be based on sound engineering principles, traffic safety considerations, and the circumstances of the site, proposed use, and development. Acceleration and deceleration lanes must conform with the details found in Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development.
(9)
Driveway and access permits. A permit must be obtained from the county road department for any street or driveway entering a county road. The permit for a driveway must be obtained before a building permit will be issued except where curb and gutter has been previously installed.
(10)
Right-of-way width. Any road or street in any non-commercial or non-industrial area shall have sufficient right-of-way for proper utility and drainage easements or 60 feet whichever is greater with a cul-de-sac diameter of not less than 70 feet. Right-of-way in any commercial or industrial development shall be not less than 60 feet with a cul-de-sac diameter of not less than 150 feet.
(11)
Curb for non-commercial and non-industrial streets. All non-commercial and non-industrial streets shall have vertical face curb and gutter with a distance of not less than 24 feet back of curb to back of curb (except as hereafter provided). Vertical face curb shall conform to the specifications contained in the Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. "Roll-back" curb and gutter is prohibited. If a subdivision development consists of a minimum of two (2) acres per lot, the developer shall not be required to install curb and gutter; provided however, the developer, prior to the commencement of construction shall provide the county engineer with a copy of the recorded plat of said subdivision which shall contain a restrictive covenant, in addition to any other covenants, providing that said lots may not be re-subdivided into smaller lots and an affidavit that upon the conveyance of a lot to a third party, the deed shall specifically contain therein the provision that said lot cannot be re-subdivided into smaller lots not withstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
(12)
Sidewalks. Except in A-1 or RE Districts, sidewalks, 60 inches wide or greater, shall be constructed on at least one side of all streets throughout any subdivision developments. Sidewalks shall also be installed along the frontage of an existing County road for any residential or commercial development. Industrial developments may be required to install sidewalks, at the discretion of the County Engineer, where connectivity may be accomplished. Sidewalks shall be constructed in conformity with the details found in the Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development.
(13)
Curb for commercial and industrial streets. All commercial and industrial streets shall have six inch by 30 inch vertical face curbs with a distance of not less than 31 feet "back of curb to back of curb."
(14)
As-built certification. The developer's engineer shall, upon completion of roadway construction in compliance with these regulations, cause to be prepared an as-built certification for all roads, streets, and drainage systems for design compliance. A standard form of certification will be provided by the county.
(15)
Deed of dedication. The developer shall, upon completion of the above requirements, cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to Bartow County with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by Bartow County of the roadways and associated infrastructure improvements. Upon acceptance of said road or street, the same shall be open to the general public at all times subject only to any restrictions placed upon it by Bartow County. The county shall not be required to accept the dedication until all criteria of these regulations, including placement of final wearing surface, are met. Acceptance shall only occur by resolution of the commissioner adopted at a public hearing.
(16)
Warranty and maintenance period; requirements. Commercial or industrial roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. Non-commercial and non-industrial roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from acceptance by the county of the roadways, except for roadways with sanitary sewer, in which case the warranty period shall extend two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. In all cases, the warranty period begins to run on the date the commissioner accepts the deed of dedication by resolution at a public hearing. The warranty shall mean that if the road fails within the warranty period, the road shall be repaired by the permit holder, or else the county shall draw on the surety to pay for the repair. Road failures include dips in the surface, raveling, potholes, and any other defect that means the road does not meet the standards and regulations of the county, as determined solely by the county. The surety required by subsection 5.28(e) shall remain in effect the applicable warranty period to secure maintenance. Work in an existing county right-of-way (for example, to tie in a new development) shall be warranted for a period of two years.
(17)
Subdividing or development on existing county roads. If a subdivision (subdividing a property into three or more lots) or a residential, commercial or industrial development occurs on an existing county road, the right-of-way should be increased to 60 feet. The developer is only responsible for the one side of the road he or she owns, unless the development is on both sides of the road. For example, if the existing right-of-way is 40 feet, the developer should grant 10 feet of right-of-way.
(18)
Right-of-way in addition to 60 feet. Subdividing or development on certain major thoroughfares will require additional right-of-way in excess of 60 feet. Minor arterials, as identified on the Bartow County Functional Classification Road Network Map, will require 100 feet of right-of-way. Major collector roads, as identified on the road classification map, will require 80 feet of right-of-way.

A registered professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia must design and provide documentation that the proposed storm drainage improvements indicated on the site development plan are adequate and will not adversely impact downstream property owners. Said documentation shall include but not be limited to, storm pipe design calculations for hydraulic design review, calculations to show adequacy of receiving ditch including effects of concentrated discharge and engineer's certificate regarding storm water runoff.
(2)
Connection to existing storm drain required. If a storm drainage sewer system exists in the governmental area, then the proposed development must contain an underground storm drainage system that will be connected to the existing area system. Such system shall be indicated on the plat.
(3)
Provision for stormwater facilities. If an adequate storm drainage sewer system does not exist in the governmental area, then adequate surface drainage facilities, as designed by an engineer or landscape architect and documented by a surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia, shall be included in the site development plan and so indicated on the plat.
(4)
Standards. Commercial, industrial and residential site development plans shall include storm water management facilities which limit surface water discharge to predevelopment rates for all frequencies from the two-year through the 100-year storm events. All stormwater detention facilities shall contain concrete or pure aluminum pipe. All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed and certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia.
(5)
Security and access. All ponds proposed to be deeded to the county shall be contained on an "out parcel" and shall have a four-foot high security fence with a 12-foot access gate around the perimeter of the out parcel. A minimum 20-foot wide access ramp must be provided to the facility. Owner/developer shall take precautionary measures to deter children from going near detention ponds. "KEEP OUT" and other warning signs shall be posted. All private stormwater detention facilities shall have a four-foot high security fence around the perimeter of the detention pond, with a 12-foot access gate. Owner/developer shall take precautionary measures to deter children from going near detention ponds. "KEEP OUT" and other warning signs shall be posted. As-built detention pond certification (standard form provided by engineering department) shall be provided by the design engineer to ensure compliance with design.
(6)
Performance standards. In all cases site development plans shall include adequate storm water management facilities which are designed and constructed to avoid any adverse impact on downstream property owners including, without limitation, recorded downstream drainage easements to the county. The "rational method" is not acceptable for stormwater detention design. See the Bartow County Development Checklist for acceptable methods.
(7)
Dedication in single-family subdivisions. The developer of single-family subdivisions shall, upon completion of the above requirements for detention ponds and access easements, cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to the county with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by the county. Upon acceptance of said detention pond, the developer shall warrant the facility for a period of one year after acceptance.
(8)
Indemnification. All developments shall provide an owner's indemnification statement.
(9)
Drainage easements. Where a proposed development is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a minimum ten feet of storm water easement or drainage right-of-way along each side of the channel or course for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such drainage easement. Open drainage ditches shall have no greater than 4:1 side slopes and fall entirely within the easement. Proposed ditches within a development shall be maintained and protected by the individual lot owner, unless shown otherwise. Notice of same shall be included on the recorded plat of the development and on each individual deed of conveyance.
(10)
Standards on structures. All drainage systems must utilize drop inlets and/or catch basins constructed to Georgia Department of Transportation standards, unless a drainage study sealed by a professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia and approved by the county, indicates the conditions require a different drainage structure. Spillways are prohibited within the right-of-way. All structures not conforming to Georgia Department of Transportation standards must be designed by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia and must be approved by the county.
(11)
Street grading. Street grades must be such that drainage flows away from intersecting streets. Each street shall have low points constructed at a minimum of 12 feet from the edge of the paving on intersecting streets and a minimum of six inches below the edge of the pavement.
(12)
Flood hazard area delineation. Location of 100-year flood hazard area, if any, must be delineated on the plan. FEMA procedures shall be followed in arriving at flood plain determinations and the Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (Code section 34-31 et seq.) shall be complied with. Where encroachment is proposed, an engineer's certificate for flood plains must be provided along with an as-built certification upon construction completion.
(13)
Plat acceptance criteria. Proposed preliminary and final plats of development, both residential and commercial, located contiguous to or within flood hazard areas shall not be accepted, except in accordance with the following requirements:
a.
Base flood elevation. Each plat shall contain a notation clearly stating the water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to mean sea level or as accepted by the engineering department. Any lands below this elevation shall be designated on the plat by a heavy contour-type line, depicting the base flood level and created as a drainage easement.
b.
Individual lot plat and certification. A property plat of each residential lot, any portion thereof which is flooded by the base flood, shall be submitted to the engineering department for review and acceptance prior to issuance of the building permit. Said plat shall have located and noted thereon the building, driveway, setbacks, finished floor elevations (including basement) above base flood, floodplain coverage and elevations, area above base flood elevation, and all easements. All elevations shall be referenced to NGVD (mean sea level) or acceptable datum. Prior to rough inspection, certification of compliance with Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance shall be submitted to the engineering department for acceptance. This requirement is applicable to all subdivision lots encumbered by a flood hazard area which are unbuilt and unpermitted as of the February 21, 1996. Base flood is defined in the Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance and is to include the pool of stormwater created by the base storm resulting from manmade stormwater drainage structures or constrictions to flow including pipes, culverts, dams, channelizations, etc.
(14)
Flood hazard area kept clear. All owners of any property subject to regulation under these regulations shall maintain all areas on their property within any special flood hazard area free of debris or obstructions which may be hazardous to the public welfare or safety, or which would interfere with the free flow of water in such a way as would increase the need for flood protection, raise the flood level, or increase the risk of hazardous inundation of adjacent properties or developments, as contemplated by these regulations. Where debris or obstructions have accumulated in areas within the base flood contour elevations in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water as would increase the need for flood protection, raise the flood level, or increase the risk of hazardous inundation of adjacent properties or jurisdictions, and the owners fail to remedy the problem, upon reasonable notice to the owner, the county is hereby authorized to enter upon such special flood hazard area and clear or remove such debris or obstructions as are hazardous to the public safety. The cost thereof may be charged to the individual or entity causing, creating, or adding to the obstruction, in the judgment of the county.
(15)
Maintenance surety. In accordance with the Bartow County stormwater management ordinance, prior to approval of final plat or issuance of certificate of occupancy, the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a maintenance bond, or an irrevocable standby letter of credit. In lieu of providing a new letter of credit, the developer shall have the option of utilizing funds that would otherwise be released for satisfaction of the E & S requirements in the existing surety, providing the amount meets the requirements of the stormwater management ordinance, and provided the form of the existing surety encompasses the warranty and maintenance obligations contained therein. If the existing surety is not adequate in amount or form for these purposes, the surety must be reissued or a new surety provided. The purpose of the surety shall be for the guarantee of the stormwater management facilities if the developer intends to deed the facilities to the county and the county is agreeable to accept ownership. See subsection 9.4.5 of the stormwater management ordinance.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 4.6; Ord. of 9-10-2008, § II(4.6.15); Ord. of 11-7-2018(2) , § III)

Driveways and walkways may cross rights-of-way.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.1)
Sec. 5.62. - Off-street parking areas.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose and intent of this section is to ensure the provision of off-street parking, loading, queuing and on-site circulation facilities in proportion to the demand created by each use. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of this section to ensure the provision of functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing and safe off-street parking, loading, queuing and circulation areas. It is the intent of this regulation to provide standards for the layout and maintenance of display or parking areas, and to provide space for the use of landscape beautification and natural plant growth for developments where off-street parking and open-lot sales, display and service areas are provided.
(b)
General requirements. The standards of this section shall apply to all new development or existing development that is modified.
(1)
New buildings or a change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided for any new building constructed, for any new use established or any change in occupancy in an existing building.
(2)
Additions and enlargements with no change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided for any addition to or enlargement of an existing building, existing use or existing manner of operation that would result in additional parking and loading spaces being required. The additional parking and loading spaces shall be required only in proportionate amount to the extent of the addition, enlargement, or change, not for the entire building. Renovations or additions to vehicular use areas shall provide landscape improvements in accordance with this section. Existing vegetation shall be preserved and incorporated into the landscaping for the vehicular use area. Creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces shall meet the requirements of the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, Ch. 34, Article VIII of the Code of Bartow County.
(c)
Location of required parking. All buildings, structures, and uses of land shall provide, on the same lot with the principal use, off-street parking and loading spaces in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. The location of off-street parking spaces shall not interfere with normal traffic flow or with operation of queuing and backup areas. Loading areas shall not obstruct pedestrian pathways. Each parking space shall be accessible from a driveway and maneuvering and turning areas shall be provided so that no vehicle will be required to back into a public street.
(1)
Adjacent parking lots serving nonresidential or mixed-use buildings shall provide for future interconnectivity. Future interconnectivity provisions for parking lots serving residential development are optional.
(2)
Location on other property. If the required automobile parking spaces cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby property within a similar zoning district, provided a major portion lies within 400 feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which such parking is provided per the approval of the engineering department.
(d)
Use of required off-street parking areas. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for the use of residents, customers, patrons, and employees. Required parking spaces shall specifically not be used for the storage, sale or display of goods or materials or for the sale, repair, or servicing of vehicles. All vehicles parked within off-street parking areas shall be registered and operable. Delivery vehicles shall utilize loading areas and not required parking spaces.
(1)
Required off-street parking and loading spaces associated with newly erected or altered buildings or newly established uses of land shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of said building or land so long as the structure or use exists or its use requiring vehicle parking or loading facilities continues. In addition, it shall be unlawful for: 1) said owner to discontinue, change or dispense with, or to cause the discontinuance, or change of the required vehicle parking or loading spaces (apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of the building or use) without establishing alternative vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance, or 2) any person to use a building or lot without providing vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance.
(2)
The maximum number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be calculated based on the schedule of standards in Table 5.1 of the Development Regulations, maximum off-street parking and loading standards. However, in an effort to reduce the amount of impervious area on developed sites, the actual number of parking and loading spaces constructed shall be determined by the owners' engineer. In any event the minimum number of parking spaces provided shall be no less than 50 percent of the maximum number as identified in Table 5.1.
(3)
Reduced, shared, or off-site parking for single-family residential districts shall be prohibited. For all other districts, the applicant may request an administrative variance for a reduction of parking standards based on the following criteria:
a.
Reduction of parking requirements through a shared parking arrangement may be permissible only through the permission of the engineering department provided the arrangement shall avoid conflicting parking demands and provide for safe pedestrian circulation and access.
b.
Parking plan drawn to scale indicating location of proposed parking spaces shall be provided.
c.
A shared or off-site parking calculation projection shall be provided that demonstrates that each use will have adequate parking provisions at all times.
d.
For contiguous properties sharing parking spaces under this provision, cross easements shall be filed establishing access to the parking spaces in perpetuity.
e.
A reduction in the number of parking spaces that would otherwise be required for each of the various uses on a multiple-use property must be clearly shown on the development plan. If shared or off-site parking is proposed for a combination of contiguous properties, a plan must be submitted covering all of the properties that will be sharing the parking spaces.
f.
A written agreement among all owners of record shall be provided and held on file with the engineering department.
(4)
For any use not listed in Table 5.1, the standards for the most similar use shall be applied. The engineering department shall determine the proper required maximum number of spaces by classifying the use among the uses specified. In making a determination, any evidence of actual parking and loading demands shall be considered as well as other reliable traffic engineering and planning information that is available to ensure sufficient parking and loading spaces are provided to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. If the number of parking and loading spaces are less than the maximum number calculated in Table 5.1, the owner shall reserve area on the site which will provide for the installation of additional spaces up to the maximum number. The reserve area shall be accessible from the driveway serving the constructed parking area. In the interim, the reserved parking site shall remain a grassed landscaped area. Based on accident reports, traffic studies, and other information related to the development, the engineering department may require the owner to install additional parking spaces to ensure public safety. If it is deemed by the engineering department that adequate parking has not been provided to serve the particular land use, additional parking shall be installed no later than 90 days from the date of official notice from the engineering department. Enforcement procedures shall be as provided in these regulations. The cost for the installation of additional parking and/or associated traffic studies, required by the engineering department, shall be borne by the owner.
(5)
Stormwater quality and quantity requirements of the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, Ch. 34, Art. VIII of the Code of Bartow County, shall be satisfied for all parking areas. Additional parking spaces, which exceed the maximum number calculated in Table 5.1, shall be constructed to allow the infiltration of stormwater by utilizing a permeable typical section with a pervious surface course. The pervious typical section and surface shall be designed in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Striping and/or curbing may be excluded in the overflow parking area upon review and approval by the engineering department. The type of pervious material, conditions of the property, and the type of land use shall be considered in the decision to exclude the striping and/or curbing.
(6)
The maximum designated parking areas, constructed parking areas, and overflow parking areas, if applicable, shall be denoted on the approved construction plan and the approved final "as-built" as shown in Figure 5-1.

The number of handicapped spaces required may be included within the overall total number of parking spaces required based on the maximum calculation in Table 1 and, if applicable, the number above the maximum spaces required. The maximum number of handicapped spaces shall comply with the following table.
(e)
General design and construction standards. Parking facilities shall be designed and located on the site in a manner that results in minimal visual impact along the street. Location, landscaping, earthwork, and buffering should all be implemented as necessary to reduce the negative visual impacts of parking facilities on the aesthetic quality of the street.
(1)
There shall be safe, adequate, and convenient arrangement of pedestrian pathways, bikeways, roads, driveways, and off-street parking and loading spaces within parking areas. Streets, pedestrian walks, parking areas, and open space shall be designed as integral parts of an overall design which shall be properly related to existing and proposed buildings, adjacent uses, and landscaped areas.
(f)
Parking facilities shall be maintained in a clean, safe, sanitary and attractive condition. Parking spaces and driving lanes shall be clearly defined and maintained as such. Parking lots shall not be operated when any damage impairs the drivability of the parking lot.
(g)
All off-street parking, loading or open-lot sales areas established pursuant to this section shall be designed, constructed and continuously maintained in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
Access. Adequate ingress and egress to such areas for vehicles shall be provided by means of clearly limited and defined paved drives. Each parking space shall have appropriate access to a street or an alley. Only dwelling units with no more than two units shall be allowed backward egress from a driveway onto a local street. In all other cases, maneuvering and access aisle area shall be sufficient to permit vehicles to enter and leave the vehicular use area in a forward motion.
(2)
Stacking. Adequate off-street stacking lanes or queuing areas shall be provided for vehicles entering the vehicular use area so as to avoid backup and congestion on adjacent public streets. A minimum queuing distance of 20 feet is required between the property line and the first parking space.
(3)
Parking access aisles. Adequate aisle width in vehicular use areas shall be provided for vehicle bypass and maneuvering areas to ensure efficient on-site circulation. For one-way drive, parallel and perpendicular or angle parking the minimum driveway width shall be 16 feet. For two-way drive, parallel parking and perpendicular or angle parking the minimum driveway width shall be 24 feet.
(4)
Pedestrian circulation. Structures, vehicular circulation lanes, parking spaces, driveways, and open spaces shall be designed to provide logical, impediment free pedestrian movement. The site shall be arranged so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic. Where off-street parking spaces directly face a structure, and are not separated from the structure by an access aisle, a paved pedestrian walkway shall be provided between the front of the structure and the parking spaces. The walkway shall be a minimum of four feet in width, exclusive of vehicle overhang, and shall be separated from the parking space by concrete wheel-stops or continuous curbing. If the pedestrian walkway adjacent to parking spaces is six feet, six inches wide with continuous curbing, then wheel stops shall not be required. There shall be a pedestrian walkway a minimum width of four feet connecting ground level parking to the public sidewalks and to all building entrances. This provision shall not apply to residential vehicular use areas.
a.
Surface parking lots shall include a pedestrian circulation system that provides access from the parking area to the building entrance, major bus stops or other critical access points. The circulation system shall be adequately lit and appropriately signed and marked. Shrub material taller than two-feet in height is not recommended along pedestrian walkways within surface parking lots.
(5)
Drainage of vehicular use areas. Areas used for display or parking shall be drained so as to eliminate surface water, unless the area or some portion of it is approved as a detention/retention area by the engineering department. Drainage is encouraged in infiltration swales located in the landscaped islands. See section 5.32 Stormwater and drainage facilities of these regulations. The drainage design shall be reviewed and approved by the engineering department prior to the issuance of a permit.
(6)
Paving standards. All parking lots, access ways, storage lots, loading or open lot sales shall be paved and constructed of a minimum of four inches of concrete or two inches of asphaltic concrete on six inches of graded aggregate base (gab), or a base and surface material of equivalent durability as certified by the developer's engineer. Such paved areas shall be maintained in good condition by the owner to prevent any hazards, such as cracked asphalt or potholes. Responsibility for pavement failure occurring as a result of inadequate alternative base and surface material design shall fall on the certifying engineer. The following are exceptions to the above paving standards:
a.
Storage lots serving facilities within an industrial or light industrial zoning district may be constructed of six inches of graded aggregate at a minimum provided the following requirements are met:
1.
The storage area is setback a minimum of 100 feet from a public right-of-way excluding interstate highway rights-of-way.
2.
Clearly limited and defined vehicular drives for ingress and egress to the storage area are provided; drive widths shall not exceed 30 feet.
3.
A vegetated buffer 20 feet in width and consisting of evergreen plants is installed along the perimeter of the storage lot. The vegetative buffer shall create a visual screen that is 75 percent or more opaque and reaches a height of six feet within two years.
4.
Water and other dust control measures shall be applied during the installation of graded aggregate.
b.
Drives serving unmanned facilities may be constructed of six inches of graded aggregate provided the required drive, from the edge of the public roadway for a distance of 100 feet, meets the paving standards of this section.
c.
Alternative paving methods or parking lot surfaces may be considered if adequate standards and installation procedures are followed per the manufacturer's recommendations or approved design plans. The alternative method will need to be reviewed and approved by the county engineer. Such alternative methods may include but are not limited to the following: porous concrete, pervious pavers, or gravel parking pads. The purpose of these methods is to limit the large, open impervious parking lots. Concrete and asphalt paving requirements may not be logical or affordable for large parking areas that are not adjacent to buildings, therefore the county engineer is authorized to determine that paving requirements may be lessened for industrial and commercial overflow parking areas as well as for commercial outdoor storage parking areas. To lessen such regulations, the county engineer may decide based on the proposed civil plans that the reduction is consistent with the spirit and intent of the code, will not harm the public interest or adjacent property, and is in the best interests of the county. Any such approved modification shall be noted on the civil plans to provide public record of the fact that existing regulations have been varied for the proposed development.
(h)
Standard parking space dimensions and marking. Each required regular parking space shall measure a minimum of nine feet wide by 18 feet deep for perpendicular or angle parking, and a minimum of nine feet by 22 feet for parallel parking. Each parking space shall be delineated with white, street marking paint with stripes four inches wide on each side for the required length of the parking or loading space.
(i)
Compact parking spaces. Developments where 30 or more parking spaces are provided shall be required to have a minimum of five compact parking spaces. Compact parking spaces shall be identified by pavement markings and/or by appropriate signage and shall not be less than eight feet wide by 15 feet deep.
(j)
All parking space dimensions and markings shall be designed to conform to the geometric design standards of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).
(k)
Handicapped parking space standards. Handicapped-accessible parking spaces shall meet the requirements of the Georgia Accessibility Code.
(l)
Off-street loading and unloading. Every building or structure used for business, trade, or industry, shall provide space for the loading and unloading of vehicles off the right-of-way of the street or public alley. Such space shall have access to an alley or if there is not alley, to a street. Each required loading space shall measure a minimum of ten feet in width and 30 feet in length, with a 14-foot overhead clearance, except that loading spaces to be utilized by wholesale and industrial operations shall be a minimum of 50 feet in length. Such space shall be so arranged that no vehicle is required to back onto a public street, road, or highway in order to leave the premises.
(m)
Landscaping and curbing. Landscaped areas shall be provided and maintained around the perimeter and within the area used for parking, loading or open-lot sales as set forth in section 5.63. Wheel-stops or continuous curbing shall be placed two and one-half feet back from walls, poles, structures, pedestrian walkways or landscaped areas.
(n)
Lighting. If a vehicular use area is to be open for use after dark, it shall be lighted. Lighting shall be arranged and designed so that no source of light is directed toward any adjoining or nearby land used or classified for residential use. Lighting shall be designed to shield public streets and all other adjacent lands from direct or distracting glare, or hazardous interference of any kind. Lighting shall be arranged so as not to conflict with tree heights at maturity.
(1)
Parking lot lighting shall be provided throughout after dark parking facilities to equal a minimum of one-fifth (0.2) footcandle of light. A footcandle of light is a uniformly distributed flux of one lumen on a surface of one square foot in area. Where applicable, public street lighting may be utilized to either partially or totally fulfill the lighting requirements; however, where such street lighting is removed, it shall be the responsibility of the parking facility to independently provide these required levels of illumination.
(2)
Parking lots adjacent to residential buffer areas shall reduce light spillage onto residential properties by providing cutoff luminaires which have a maximum 90 degree illumination.
(3)
Parking deck lighting fixtures at a maximum of seven feet above grade shall not be visible from any public right-of-way.
(o)
Signs. Traffic control signs and other pavement markings shall be installed and maintained as necessary to ensure safe and efficient traffic operation of all vehicular use areas.
(p)
Parking decks and structures. The following regulations shall apply to all parking decks and parking structures:
(1)
Parking deck façades shall conceal automobiles from visibility from any public right-of-way or private drive or street that are open to the general public, and shall have the appearance of a horizontal storied building.
(2)
All parking decks and parking structures shall have pedestrian walkways a minimum width of four feet connecting ground level parking to the public sidewalks and to all building entrances.
(3)
All parking decks and parking structures shall have a landscape strip a minimum width of six feet immediately contiguous to the parking facility for the whole of the exterior perimeter of the parking facility containing at least one understory or overstory tree, as appropriate, and additional shrubs, groundcover, or sod as specified in the landscape installation requirements of this section.
(q)
Plan approval required. Plans for the layout and design of all areas to be used for parking, loading or open-lot sales must be approved by the engineering department for compliance with the development regulations.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.2; Ord of 5-6-2009, § I; Ord. of 1-5-2022(1) , § I)
Sec. 5.63. - Landscape requirements for non-residential development.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements for landscape areas and buffers in Bartow County's non-residential, and multi-family zoning districts. Said requirements are designed to:
(1)
Improve the appearance of Bartow County's commercial and industrial corridors and multi-family developments;
(2)
Minimize noise, glare, and erosion;
(3)
Provide a visual separation between incompatible uses;
(4)
Maintain the county's environmental standards for quality new development;
(5)
Maximize opportunities for trees and other landscaping to create a high quality open space;
(6)
Enhance environmental conditions by providing shade, air purification, and reduction of storm water run-off;
(7)
To help filter noise and light;
(8)
Provide character by enhancing visual appearance; and
(9)
Establish measures for water conservation.
Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by such requirements within these development regulations. Landscaped areas shall be provided and maintained around the perimeter and within the area used for parking, loading or open-lot sales as set forth hereinafter; and concrete curbs of a design approved by the engineering department shall be installed around the perimeter of all landscaped areas. Consideration will be given to alternate designs when islands are used for stormwater management to assist in achieving water quality/quantity requirements.
(b)
Landscape plan submission. The applicant shall submit to the engineering department five sets of construction plans depicting the layout and design of the proposed off-street parking, loading and/or open lot sale area, hereinafter identified as the "vehicular use area." Said plan depicting the layout and design of the proposed vehicular use area shall provide the information required for a predevelopment site plan as set forth in section 5.62 of the development regulations.
The plan shall be submitted and approved as part of the construction plan as required by the provisions of these regulations and the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance. The plan shall show lot or parcel dimensions, building dimensions, tree/landscape preservation areas, and the location and size of all tree and plant materials. All landscape plans must be prepared and stamped by a registered landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Georgia and should follow the general landscape principles of preservation, creativity, quality and an emphasis should be placed on the use of Xeriscape.
(c)
General requirements. Plan submission and required landscaping features for vehicular use areas.
(1)
The areas used for the display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use, hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular uses," including but not limited to activities of a drive-in nature such as, but not limited to, filling stations, grocery and dairy stores, banks, restaurants, and the like, shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided, except areas used for parking or other vehicular uses under, on or within buildings, and parking areas serving single-and two-family uses as normally such residential areas are voluntarily landscaped.
(d)
Landscaping requirements. All vehicular use areas shall comply with the following landscaping requirements:
(1)
Perimeter landscape requirements. All building perimeters shall have a landscape area or sidewalk of not less than five feet in width. In no case shall asphalt paving areas be contiguous to the base of a building. All exterior perimeters of all vehicular use areas shall have a perimeter landscaped area with no horizontal dimension less than five feet. A minimum of one tree for every 75 linear feet of perimeter area shall be required. A decorative masonry wall, earth berm, natural landscaping screen, new plantings, or some combination of these elements shall be installed in such a manner as to partially screen the vehicular use area from adjacent properties. Such screening shall be maintained at a minimum height of three feet. In no case shall these requirements be interrupted to allow an obstruction of site distance. See corner visibility requirement in subsection (2) below.
(2)
Street landscape requirements. When abutting a public street right-of-way, landscaping areas shall have a minimum dimension of ten feet from the right-of-way line to the vehicular use area. A minimum of one tree for every 30 linear feet of road frontage area (minimum two trees) shall be required. If a parcel or lot has more than one street planting area (i.e. more than one street frontage), each shall be considered separately. If a building site contains more than one parcel or lot, the entire site shall be treated as a single entity. Forty percent of the street planting area shall be comprised of shrub materials.
Signs may be placed within the street planting area, monument style, and placed at least ten horizontal feet from all property lines, or one foot behind right-of-way for every foot of height, whichever is greater. No sign or planting shall be erected that obstructs sight distance at an intersection or along a public right-of-way. In all zoning districts, no sign of any type or design that obstructs vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above grade shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of street and/or railroads. Traffic control signs and signals are exempt from this regulation.
In addition, the requirements for corner visibility must be met as follows: There shall be provided an unobstructed view across the triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet distant along the property line from the intersection of two streets or 20 feet along both the street and alley line from the intersection of a street and an alley. Within said triangle there shall be no sight-obscuring wall, fence or foliage higher than 30 inches above grade or, in the case of trees, foliage lower than eight feet. Vertical measurement shall be made at the top of the curb on the street or alley adjacent to the nearest side of the triangle, or, if no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way. See Bartow County Zoning Ordinance, Appendix A of the Code of Bartow County, for additional sign regulations.
(3)
Mandatory terminal island design. Each single and double row of parking spaces shall be terminated by landscaped islands contoured as indicated in the diagram below or approved similar design. A terminal island shall be no less than nine feet in width and no less than 15 feet in length and shall include at least one tree having a clear trunk of at least five feet, with the remaining area adequately landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other authorized landscaping material not to exceed three feet in height. Larger islands should be considered for planting of larger-maturing trees. At the discretion of the County Engineer this requirement may be varied to allow for an alternate design for large truck storage lots with additional perimeter landscaping in lieu of terminal islands with landscaping.
(4)
Mandatory interior island design. Interior landscaped islands shall be provided within each row of parking spaces and contoured as indicated in the diagram below. A minimum of one interior island shall be provided for every 15 parking spaces or fraction thereof. Landscaped interior islands shall measure not less than nine feet in width. The length of the interior islands shall be no less than the minimum required depth of parking space. Landscape strips a minimum of five feet in width shall be provided for every other interior-parking isle. Larger islands should be considered for planting of larger-maturing trees. At the discretion of the County Engineer this requirement may be varied to allow for an alternate design for large truck storage lots and student parking areas with additional perimeter and/or terminal-island landscaping in lieu of interior islands with landscaping.
(5)
The perimeter of terminal islands and interior islands shall be surrounded with a continuous, raised curb. Exemptions include those landscaped islands intended for stormwater retention/detention. See Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for additional requirements regarding stormwater management. Landscape island width shall be measured from the inside edge of the curb. Trees planted in vehicular use areas shall be allowed to grow to a mature height and a full canopy. Pruning shall be limited to periodic trimmings to maintain the health of the trees or shrubs.
(6)
Minimum landscape installation requirements. All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with accepted good planting procedures.
(7)
Tree protection. During development of any project there shall be erected and maintained suitable protective barriers around all trees to be retained so as to prevent damage thereto. All building materials, soil stockpiles or other debris shall be kept outside the barriers. There shall be no paving with any impervious materials or grading within 15 feet of any tree to be retained.
(e)
New plant materials. All new living plant materials shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) or better as defined in the most current edition of Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants.
(1)
Xeriscape requirements. All street frontage, parking lot, and side yard landscape areas shall be planted with water-conserving groundcover and vegetation. Other conservation measures are encouraged, including:
a.
Irrigation systems which are electronically set for night and/or early morning irrigation;
b.
Designs which collect and recycle water; and
c.
The minimization of overspray onto non-landscaped areas to avoid wasting water.
(2)
All separate landscaped areas shall have a minimum variety of two living plant materials.
(3)
Paving (other than walks) and artificial plants shall not be permitted within landscaping areas.
(4)
Trees. A tree shall attain an average crown spread over 15 feet at maturity. Trees having an average crown spread less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown spread. All trees shall be of a species which can be maintained with a minimum of five feet of trunk height. Trees shall have a minimum of two inches DBH (diameter at breast height) measured four and one-half feet above the ground and shall be a minimum of eight feet in overall height immediately after planting.
(5)
Shrubs. Shrubs shall be a minimum of one foot in height when measured at the time of planting except where they are to act as screening for residential use or districts, in which case, they shall be a minimum of three feet in height at the time of planting and maintained at a minimum height of five feet at maturity, unless otherwise indicated in this section.
(6)
Lawn grass and ground covers. Grass may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. In areas where plant material other than solid sod or grass is used, a fast-growing grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until coverage is otherwise achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests or disease. Ground covers which present a finished appearance and meet the requirements of final stabilization as defined in the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance at time of planting may be used in lieu of grass sod.
(f)
Tree species. The owner/developer should contact the Georgia Forestry Commission or the University of Georgia Extension Service to obtain a list of native trees and plantings which are most tolerant of the urban environment.
(g)
Existing plant material. Desirable existing natural plant material shall be preserved to the extent feasible.
(h)
Earthwork. Earth berms may be utilized within a buffer or perimeter landscaping area. Berms shall be of variable height and slope with required landscaping material installed on top and slopes stabilized with ground cover. Swales and ponds shall be permitted for on-site retention of stormwater provided they are approved by the county engineer.
(i)
Encroachment. Landscaped areas, walls, structures, and walks shall require appropriate protection from vehicular encroachment by utilizing wheel stops, curbs, posts, wood, brickwork, and/or other devices. Placement of these devices shall be located at least two and one-half feet from walks, walls, and structures and may be placed one foot from landscaped areas to prevent a vehicular overhang of no more than one and one-half feet of landscaping area which may be counted as part of the required depth of each parking space.
(j)
Maintenance. The owner or his agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping which shall be attractively maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All landscaped areas shall be provided with a sprinkler system, and/or other readily available water supply with at least one faucet equipped with a double check valve located within 150 feet of all plant material to be maintained. No irrigation or sprinkler system shall be allowed on the right-of-way. The owner shall replace all landscaped materials required if, for any reason, they die or are severely damaged within one year of the final approval of the installation. The owner is thereafter responsible to maintain the landscaping in a healthy manner. All dead and/or diseased plants shall be replaced annually as a condition of occupancy.
(k)
Planting bed. The planting bed for all landscaping materials shall be free of weeds, debris, and noxious material and shall consist of a healthy plant growth medium. The planting bed soil shall provide adequate support, drainage, and nutrients for the plants and thus may require the incorporation of sand, peat, and/or topsoil into the soil. Such planting soil shall be placed throughout the planting hole for each plant, and this hole shall be at least twice as wide as the width of the plant ball and one and one-half times as deep as the depth of the plant ball.
(l)
Prohibited plants. No plants with vigorous root systems shall be planted within any sanitary sewer or public water easement. Such plants include the following: Eastern Cottonwood, Willow, Lombardy Poplar
Certificate of compliance. All landscaping for each phase of development shall be completed prior to the recording of the final plat for that phase or prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy for that phase. Upon completion of the landscape improvements, the site shall be inspected by the engineering department for compliance with the approved landscape plan. A certificate of compliance certified by the design professional who prepared the plan must be submitted and accepted the by engineering department before a certificate of occupancy can be issued for any related structures.
In the event that the requirements of this article have not been met at the time that a certificate of occupancy could otherwise be granted in the case of an undue hardship or circumstances beyond the owner/developer's control, the owner or his agent shall post a landscape performance bond, letter of credit or other county approved surety in the amount equal to 100 percent of the cost of materials, labor, and other attendant costs, incidental to the installation of the required landscaping. Said surety shall be drawn in favor of Bartow County, be in a form satisfactory to the county, and specify the time for the completion of the landscaping requirements of this article which shall not be longer than six months following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy.
(m)
Lot remnant plantings. All land surfaces other than those that are covered by buildings, structures, paving, or other required site elements shall be landscaped with well maintained grass, flowers, shrubs, or other suitable plant materials approved by the engineering department. The location and detail of all other landscaped areas shall be depicted on the required landscaping/tree protection plan.
(n)
Impervious area. Impervious surface areas shall not be allowed to cover more than 75 percent of the lot.
(o)
Landscape bond. Upon final installation of new trees, shrubs or other landscape material planted to meet the requirements of this ordinance, and before approval of final plat or certificate of occupancy, the owner shall either post a maintenance bond or letter of credit in an amount equal to 75 percent of the value of the new trees or landscape material and their installation, warranting the new trees, shrubs or landscape material for a period of no less than 15 months from approval of final plat or certificate of occupancy. The county engineer shall be authorized to reduce or eliminate the bonding requirement as an incentive to install better landscaping materials (for example, sodding rather than seeding disturbed areas).
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.3; Ord. of 5-6-2009, § II; Ord. of 5-11-2016, § XII ; Ord. of 11-7-2018(2) , § IV)
Sec. 5.64. - Debris fills.
Debris fills (i.e. the burying of construction waste, scrap lumber, stumps and branches, etc.) are prohibited, including debris fills at all construction sites and within any development, and including bury pits. The burying of construction debris, cleared trees and shrubs, and similar by-products of development is strictly prohibited. All solid waste, demolition debris and construction debris generated from construction must be properly disposed of in the county landfill. However, "fills," defined as earth embankments for construction purposes (as opposed to disposal purposes) made up of soil materials, are acceptable using acceptable soil materials. Acceptable soil materials are as follows: gravel, silt, clay, sand or loose rock up to six inches in diameter. All fills shall be marked on the recorded plat and site plans. No fill may exceed 250 cubic yards without a variance. See also the provisions of the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance for further regulations of cuts and fills.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.4)
Sec. 5.65. - Stream buffers.
(a)
Undisturbed buffer. An undisturbed vegetative buffer is required for any watercourse, river or stream shown on a 7.5 degree quadrangle map (1:24,000 scale) United States Geological Survey map most recently published, or on any other official U.S. Geological Survey map. Such buffer is to be a minimum of 50 feet on each side of the river or stream, as measured horizontally either from the top of the stream bank, or from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, whichever provides a larger buffer. Access points to the stream for livestock watering shall be allowed, but must be constructed following best management practices (BMPs) to minimize pollution and sedimentation to the stream or river. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted.
(b)
Setback buffer. A further 25-foot setback buffer is imposed outside the 50-foot buffer; in the setback buffer, no impervious surfaces (including driveways, walkways, patios, other paving, etc.), nor septic tanks, septic drain fields or similar disposal systems, may be placed. Grading, filling, and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback buffer. Any unauthorized disturbance of the buffer during construction must be restored to a vegetative density similar to the adjacent buffer areas, and also constitutes a violation of these regulations. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted.
(c)
Applications. Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setback buffers under this section must include all information requested by the county engineer to insure compliance with this section, with the following as a minimum: a site plan showing: the location of all streams on the property, the limits of required stream buffers and setbacks on the property, buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five-foot contour intervals; delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone, and detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback. Additionally, a description of all proposed land development within the buffer and setback is required.
(d)
Variances. Variances shall be granted under Article V. Additional provisions apply to variances from stream buffers, as contained therein. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.5)
Sec. 5.66. - Inspection of required buffers and requirements.
Any buffer or other requirement of these regulations is subject to periodic inspections by the county engineer to determine that such buffer or requirement is in existence, and is being properly maintained. Failure to provide or maintain any requirement of these regulations may be deemed a violation of these regulations.
(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 5.6)
Sec. 5.67. - Construction exits.
(a)
A temporary construction exit must be installed and maintained for any land disturbance or other construction occurring in the county. Such exit must be maintained while any construction and/or grading equipment will be leaving a construction site to a public right-of-way, street, or parking area until construction is completed. (The construction exit may be the same as the driveway exit.)
(b)

(Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 7.2)
Sec. 5.128. - Variances.
modified
(a)
Variances. The board of appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of these regulations. Variance may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist:
(1)
That one of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor:
a.
The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped;
b.
The property contains exceptional topographic conditions;
c.
The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions; or
d.
There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and
(2)
That the strict application of the requirements of these regulations would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and
(3)
That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations.
Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten days of the hearing.
(b)
Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of these regulations will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
(c)
Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. Variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, or modify a requirement due to hardships such as those listed in subparagraph (a)(1) above. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied, or to eliminate rather than modify a requirement or regulation. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). The Board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to February 21, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or predecessor, that do not justify a variance.
(d)
Special stream buffer provisions. If the variance is related to section 64-65 stream buffers, variances will only be considered when a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing as of April 30, 2004 prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted, or if unusual circumstances exist wherein strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirement of that section would create extreme hardship. Variances will not be considered when actions of the property owner have created the conditions of hardship on the property. Variances may be conditioned or limited to serve the purposes of this chapter, and only the minimum variance necessary shall be given.
(e)
Special stream buffer application requirements. If the variance is related to section 64-65 stream buffers, the application shall contain the following information, and other information as required by the county engineer:
(1)
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
(2)
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
(3)
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
(4)
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
(5)
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
(6)
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
(7)
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
(8)
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(f)
Administrative variance. If in the judgment of the county engineer, the application of any particular numeric criteria, standard or requirement contained in these development regulations causes undue hardship on the applicant, the county engineer shall be empowered to grant an administrative variance to alter said requirement by up to 20 percent, if in doing so, the purposes of the regulations are not impaired, and there is not a negative impact on the surrounding uses, properties, or neighbors. The county engineer cannot grant a variance to a provision of the zoning ordinance, or to State-issued manuals and design standards (for example MUTCD, the GDOT Driveway Encroachment Standards, etc.), street design standards, sureties, and reporting. In granting an administrative variance, the county engineer may attach such conditions as the county engineer may deem advisable so that the purpose of this ordinance will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. An administrative variance shall be granted or denied in writing. Notice of the grant of an administrative variance shall be sent to all adjoining property owners via first class mail by the applicant. The notice shall describe the variance granted and state that interested parties have 30 days in which to file an appeal of the variance. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. Proof of mailing, shall be submitted to the zoning department within ten days of grant of the variance. "Proof of mailing" means either a first class "certificate of mailing" or a first class "certified mail" receipt; a proof of delivery is not required. The 30 days shall be counted from the date of mailing of the notice.
