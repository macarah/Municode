Sec. 110-3. - Location and boundaries of zoning districts.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the map entitled, "Zoning and Boundary Map of the City of Bremen, Georgia" and certified by the city clerk, which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part of this chapter, as amended from time to time. Said map shall be kept on file at the city hall where it shall be available for public inspection. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning and boundary map which may from time to time be published, the Official Zoning and Boundary Map of the City of Bremen, Georgia, located in city hall (hereinafter referred to as the "zoning map") shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of properties located within the corporate limits of the city.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.020)
Sec. 110-4. - Interpretations of zoning district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where a zoning district boundary is shown on the zoning map as approximately following a corporate limits lines, stream bed, lot line or the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the district boundary line.
(2)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown on the zoning map as being set back from a street, highway, or railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such district boundary line, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.
(3)
Where a zoning district line divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary line. In the case of a through lot, fronting on two approximately parallel streets, that is divided by a district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that respective portion of the through lot, as if the lot were two separate lots.
(4)
The zoning district lines for the flood hazard district shall generally follow the contours of the land along the flood plain. Minimum flood level elevations are recorded at periodic intervals along the flood hazard district lines. At intermediate points, interpolation between the recorded even-foot elevations will be used to establish the minimum flood level. All elevations are based upon the U.S. Geological Survey datum.
(5)
Where district boundaries are in doubt, the planning commission shall review the zoning records and the zoning map and make the determination as to the zoning designation for the property in question. Said interpretation and determination shall be final.
(6)
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.030)
Sec. 110-5. - Uses; uses not listed.
Uses permitted in each district are specifically listed. Higher uses, or uses allowed in a more restrictive district are not automatically allowed in a lower use district, unless so stated. For any use not listed in this chapter, the city manager shall determine the proper requirements by classifying the proposed use among the uses which are listed and assigning the use to appropriate zoning district, which may be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission pursuant to the standards for review and as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.040)

No structures or obstruction to stormwater flow shall be erected or installed below the maximum flood elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval storm unless a plan is approved to compensate for the loss of flow area and flood storage. Land adjacent to flood hazard districts may be subject to periodic flooding even though it lies above the established minimum flood elevation. It shall remain the responsibility of the developer to adequately investigate the possibility of local flooding above the established minimum levels and to guard against damages which might be associated with such flooding. The planning commission may, when it deems it advisable, require proof to its satisfaction that no structures or obstructions will be erected or installed below the established minimum flood elevations.

e.
Parking areas. All required parking areas shall be located at an elevation higher than the calculated five-year storm, and shall not be located within any floodway.
f.
Outdoor storage.
g.

(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.9.20)
Sec. 110-185. - Substandard lots of record.
When a lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of a particular provision requiring a certain minimum lot width, has an area or a width that is less than the width required by the new regulation,, the existing lot of record may be used, subject to the following exceptions and modifications:
(1)
Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this chapter and such lots, individually, have an area or width that is less than required by this chapter, such groups of lots may be considered as a single lot or several lots of the minimum width and area required in the district in which they are located
(2)
Individual lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, which has an area, width or depth less than that required by this chapter, may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling. In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the planning commission is hereby authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be less than five feet in width.
(Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.9.30)

(1)
Extended to occupy a greater area of land.
(2)
Extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of this chapter and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure.
(3)
Re-established after discontinuance for six months. Nothing herein shall be considered to approve or give legality to any nonconforming use which has been discontinued more than six months within the city.

(4)
Changed to another nonconforming use in a different zoning classification without approval of application for rezoning. For the purposes of this section, the districts shall have priority as established by the order of their listing in article I of this chapter (for example, a commercial classification would be of a lower priority than a residential classification).
