(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 10, § 10.1, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-214. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to:
(1)
Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(2)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal;
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way to minimize the adverse visual impact to the city;
(5)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the city quickly, effectively and efficiently.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 10, § 10.2, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-215. - Aesthetics.
The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas governed by this article.
(1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping which will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color or colors that is identical to, or is closely comparable with, the supporting structure and/or surrounding area so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design, which would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 10, § 10.3, 12-3-2007)
Sec. 74-216. - General.
(a)
Height limitations. The height limitations set forth in this section of the zoning ordinance as applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antenna. Towers and antenna shall be governed by the special use permit procedures set forth therein.
(b)
Tower height threshold. These standards shall only be applicable to antenna and towers in excess of 35 feet in height.
(c)
The city council may consider for approval a site plan specific request, which is in substantial conformance with the requirements listed herein.
(Ord. No. 07-05, Art. 10, § 10.4, 12-3-2007)

(f)
All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission or such governing agency guidelines as may be established by named agencies. All towers and antennae must be updated and brought into conformity with such standards and regulations within six months of their adoption. The failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the City of Senoia to require removal or re-permitting of the antennae or tower at the owner's expense.
(g)
At the time of application for building permit, the plans for tower or antenna construction shall be certified by an independent registered structural engineer as meeting all current safety and design standards of all applicable codes. Cost of engineering evaluation shall be the responsibility of the individual or corporation applying for the building permit.
(h)
All conditional use permits mush show proof of notification to Big T Airport.
Big T Airport Owner's Association
(i)
Applicants are required to explore and fully utilize existing tower and antennae space and are required to bear an equitable share of capital, operating and other expenses in connection with such shared usage.
(j)
Non-residential sites are encouraged for tower location where possible and use of platted lots in existing subdivisions are discouraged.
(k)
In addition, all such towers and antennae shall be designed to minimize visual and scenic impact when located on slopes greater than 15 percent or on top of such slopes.
(l)
Any tower approved under the provision of this article which is not utilized by any communications service provider for any communications related purpose for a period of 12 months may be subject for review by the planning commission for the purposes of initiating an application to zone the property back to its original district.

Sec. 74-219. - Landscape buffer/screening requirements.
(a)
Unless otherwise noted within this section's requirements, or otherwise approved by the city council, any commercial tower or antennae which abuts a residentially zoned property shall have a minimum 40 foot setback from the residential property, 15 feet of which shall be landscaped, screening buffer between the tower and the residentially zoned property, which shall be subject to city council approval. This setback is in addition to the required height setback in article XI, section 74-238.
Note: Required buffers may be included within required setbacks; however, in such case that required buffers and setbacks are in conflict the more stringent shall apply.
(b)
Additionally, necessary private utilities and/or access drives may be allowed through, over, or across a landscaped buffer. Any such uses, which are proposed through, over, or across a designated, undisturbed buffer must be approved pursuant to an original site plan approved by the city council.
