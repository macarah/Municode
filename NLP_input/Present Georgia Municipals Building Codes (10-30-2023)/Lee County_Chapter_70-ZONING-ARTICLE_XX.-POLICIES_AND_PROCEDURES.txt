Hearing procedure. Upon the completion of a rezoning application or the draft of a text amendment public hearings will be scheduled by the planning commission and the board of commissioners respectively. The official public hearing required by state law will be held by the board of commissioners, and public notice will be given no less than 15 days nor more than 45 days prior to the official public hearing date.
All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the presiding commission's agenda under a section entitled "Public Hearings". After an initial presentation of a specific zoning request to the presiding commission by the designated county staff, citizen comments will be heard in an orderly fashion. The presiding commission's chairman or designated representative will ask for those citizens speaking in favor of the request first, followed by those opposed to the issue.
Citizens shall be allowed a minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinions by proponents of each zoning decision and for the presentation by opponents of each proposed zoning decision. When there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke time limitations on individual speakers; however, the time limitation is not to be less than ten minutes per side. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers.
Citizens shall address their comments to the presiding commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross-examination of commission members, county employees, or other citizens will be ruled out of order.
After all citizen comments have been received, further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the presiding commission. The commission has the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification.
If the planning commission is presiding over the hearing they may then vote on the application for a map or text amendment and forward their recommendation to the county commission. Failure of the planning commission to take action will result in no recommendation being forwarded to the board of commissioners at the official advertised public hearing.
(c)
Pursuant to § 36-67A-3 O.C.G.A. as amended, all speakers shall be required to provide names and addresses for the public record and sign a "campaign disclosure form". This form requires all those speaking in favor of, or in opposition to a rezoning disclose whether they have made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to any member of the county commission within the past two years. Such disclosure shall include the name of the commissioner(s), the dollar amount, description, and date of each such campaign contribution.
(d)
Public hearings records standards. The planning commission secretary and county clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of their respective public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party. Recorded tapes of public hearings shall be kept secure and not erased for one year from the date of the public hearing. A summary of the proceedings of each meeting will be made available to the public within two working days after the meeting. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file.
