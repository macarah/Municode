Small wireless facilities and new, modified, or replacement poles to be used for collocation of small wireless facilities may be placed in the public right-of-way: (i) upon a receipt of a permit under this article; (ii) subject to all applicable codes; and (iii) so long as such small wireless facilities and new, modified, or replacement poles to be used for collocation of small wireless facilities comply with the appropriate provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-66C-7(h).
(b)
Installation of new facilities in, on, along, over, or under the public rights-of-way or modification of existing facilities in, on, along, over, or under the public rights-of-way shall, in all cases:
(1)
Minimize risks to public safety;
(2)
Ensure that placement of facilities on existing structures is within the tolerances of those structures;
(3)
Ensure that installations and modifications are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the right-of-way;
(4)
Ensure that the city bears no risk or liability as a result of such installation or modification; and
(5)
Ensure that use of the public rights-of-way does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of public rights-of-way, or hinder the ability of the city or other government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon, or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation, or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way.
(c)
New, modified, or replacement poles installed in the right-of-way in a historic district and in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed 50 feet above ground level.
(d)
Each new, modified, or replacement pole installed in the right-of-way that is not in a historic district or in an area zoned primarily for residential use shall not exceed the greater of:
(1)
Fifty feet above ground level; or
(2)
Ten feet greater in height above ground level than the tallest existing pole in the same public right-of-way in place as of January 1, 2019, and located within 500 feet of the new proposed pole;
(e)
New small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way and collocated on an existing pole or support structure shall not exceed more than ten feet above the existing pole or support structure.
(f)
New small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way collocated on a new or replacement pole may not extend above the top of such poles.
(g)
A decorative pole should only be located where an existing pole can be removed and replaced, or at a new location where the city has identified that a streetlight is necessary.
(h)
Unless it is determined that another design is less intrusive, or placement is required under applicable law, small wireless facilities shall be concealed as follows:
(1)
Antennas located at the top of poles and support structures shall be incorporated into the pole or support structure, or placed within shrouds of a size such that the antenna appears to be part of the pole or support structure;
(2)
Antennas placed elsewhere on a pole or support structure shall be integrated into the pole or support structure, or be designed and placed to minimize visual impacts.
(3)
Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and mounted on a pole shall be placed as high as possible, located to avoid interfering with, or creating any hazard to, any other use of the public rights-of-way, and located on one side of the pole. Unless the radio units or equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic signage, radio units or equipment cabinets mounted below the communications space on poles shall be designed so that the largest dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite side of the pole on which they are placed.
(4)
Wiring and cabling shall be neat and concealed within or flush to the pole or support structure, ensuring concealment of these components to the greatest extent possible.
(5)
Facilities must be compatible in size, mass, and color to similar facilities in the same zoning area, with a goal of minimizing the physical and visual impact on the area. In historic and residential areas, facilities shall be architecturally integrated with the area and shall not interfere with prominent vistas or significant public view corridors.
