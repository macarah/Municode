Sec. 30-142. - Lien taken for delinquent administration and/or tax.
In addition to the other remedies provided for in this article for the collection of the occupation tax, regulatory fee, and administration fee levied by this article, the finance department, upon any installment of such tax and fee becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the person, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax and fee, which execution shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax and/or fee, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of the city and the laws of the state. The lien and/or fee shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the finance department of the city upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances of the city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the finance department against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax and fee, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax and fee rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the city of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.
