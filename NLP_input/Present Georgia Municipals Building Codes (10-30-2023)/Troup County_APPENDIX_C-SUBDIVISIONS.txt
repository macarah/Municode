Editor's note— Ord. No. 2006-03, adopted April 18, 2006, amended App. C in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former App. C, Arts. I—VII, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the county's subdivisions ordinance, adopted on November 6, 1984, and as published as Appendix D in the county's 1987 Code of Ordinances as supplemented through Supp. No. 24, July 2001. Amendments to the subdivisions ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance as codified. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

These may include but are not limited to general area of any wetlands or whether the property is located in groundwater recharge area or any other environmentally sensitive area as can be deemed from existing records.
4.
Approval may be denied on a proposed subdivision where the planning commission deems a public road to a proposed subdivision as being currently inadequate to service the proposed subdivision due to right-of-way width or construction.

Sec. B. - Lot specifications and dimensions.

2.
In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule gives a better street or lot plan.
3.

New streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographic conditions, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
3.
When such is not shown in the comprehensive plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
a.
Provide for the continuation or appropriate connection to existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
b.
When future connectivity is required, the right-of-way for the future street may be recorded without constructing the street provided the right-of-way is no longer than one lot depth.
c.
Conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved or adopted by the county commissioners to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
4.
Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by high volumes of through traffic will be discouraged.

Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to, and on each of side of, such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land (such as parks in residential districts). Such distance shall also be determined with regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
7.
Privately owned reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
8.
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited
9.
Street intersections should be as nearly at right angles as practical.

11.
Dead-end streets may be platted subject to the approval of the board of commissioners.
a.
Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be provided with a turnaround or cul-de-sac at the closed end. Installation shall conform to the latest county road specifications.
b.
Dead-end streets that are designed to be so temporarily shall have a temporary turnaround or cul-de-sac as a part of the construction. Said condition shall be shown on the final plat presented to the commissioners for approval. Installation shall conform to the latest county road specifications.
