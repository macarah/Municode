Sec. 42-301. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
End user means the last person who uses the scrap tires, chips, crumb rubber or similar materials to make a product with economic value or, in the case of energy recovery, the person who utilizes the heat content or other forms of energy from the incineration or pyrolysis of waste tires, chips or similar materials.
EPD means the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division.
Mixed tires means a heterogenous group of tires consisting of used, retreadable casings and scrap tires.
Retail tire dealer means a person actively engaged in the business of selling new replacement tires. Retail tire dealers may also be but are not limited to manufacturers, wholesalers and others who sell new replacement tires to the ultimate consumer.
Retreadable casing means a tire which has the quality and soundness of the tire structure to accept a retread or repair and provide additional service and is destined for retreading.
Scrap tire means a tire that is no longer suitable for its original intended purpose because of wear, damage or defect.
Scrap tire carrier means any person engaged in picking up or transporting scrap tires not otherwise exempted in this section for the purpose of removal to a scrap tire processor, end user or disposal facility.
Scrap tire generator means any person who generates scrap tires. Generators may include but are not limited to retail tire dealers, retreaders, scrap tire processors, automobile dealers, private company vehicle maintenance shops, garages, service stations and city, county or state governments.
Scrap tire processing means any method, system or other treatment designed to change the physical form, size or chemical content of scrap tires and includes all aspects of its management (administration, personnel, land, equipment, buildings and other elements). Processing includes but is not limited to shredding, baling, recycling or sorting scrap tires.
Scrap tire processor means any person who is approved by the EPD to receive scrap tires from scrap tire generators or scrap tire carriers for the purpose of scrap tire processing.
Scrap tire sorter means any person, other than the original scrap tire generator, who handles mixed tires by separating used tires and retreadable casings from scrap tires.
Tire retreader means any person actively engaged in the business of retreading scrap tires by scarifying the surface to remove the old surface treat and attaching a new tread to make a usable tire.
Ultimate consumer means the last person who receives and uses a new replacement tire. Ultimate consumers may be but are not limited to:
(1)
An individual consumer;
(2)
A leasing company purchasing tires from retailers for their vehicle fleet;

Used tire means a tire which has a minimum of 2/32 inch of road tread and which is still suitable for its original purpose. It must be inventoried and marketed in substantially the same fashion as a new tire, the dealer must be able to provide satisfactory evidence to the EPD and the special enforcement division that a market exists, and that the used tires are in fact being marketed.

Sec. 42-302. - Scrap tire generators.
(a)
Any person who generates scrap tires shall have a scrap tire generator identification number issued by the EPD. The identification number shall be used on scrap tire shipment manifests. Separate identification numbers shall be required for generators having multiple generation locations.
(b)
Generators shall initiate a three-part manifest to transport scrap tires from the point of generation to an end user or to a scrap tire processing or disposal facility approved by the EPD. The manifest shall include the following information:
(1)
Name and identification number of the generator;
(2)
Number of total tons (accurate to within ten percent of actual number) of scrap tires to be transported;
(3)
Name and permit number of the scrap tire carrier;
(4)
Date of transport; and
(5)
Destination of scrap tires.
(c)
If a generator chooses to use tons of tires rather than actual numbers of tires on the manifest for passenger and truck tires, the following conversion factor must be used:
(1)
Passenger tires, 2,000 pounds (one ton) = 100 tires @ 20 pounds per tire.
(2)
Truck tires, 2,000 pounds (one ton) = 20 tires @ 100 pounds per tire.
(d)
Unless otherwise approved in writing by the EPD, generators shall assure that any person collecting and transporting scrap tires holds a valid scrap tire carrier permit issued by the EPD.
(e)
Generators shall maintain receipts (copies of the completed manifest) for a period of three years.
(f)
A generator shall report to the special enforcement division any carrier who fails to return a properly completed manifest to the generator within 30 days of scrap tire pickup as provided for in section EPD rule 391-4-19. Such report shall be filed within 30 days of failure of the carrier to comply.
(g)
Generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage or defect, is not suitable for classification as a used tire or retreadable casing. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used," "retreadable casings," or "scrap tires," all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thus indicated on the shipment manifest.
(Ord. No. 95-27, § 4-3002, 8-24-1995)
Sec. 42-303. - Scrap tire carriers.

(6)
The United States, the state, or any county, municipality or public authority. Persons who generate less than 100 scrap tires per month and are exempt from having a carrier permit under this section are still required to comply with other applicable provisions of this article.
(7)
Other persons, as approved by the EPD, on a one-time or temporary basis, as needed to further the intent of O.C.G.A. § 12-8-20 et seq. that scrap tires be reused or recycled rather than disposed of.

Proof must be provided that there is a known market or disposition for the scrap tires or processed scrap tires and must show that they have the necessary equipment to do so, prior to receiving scrap tires for processing.
(4)
A scrap tire is sold if the generator of the scrap tire or the person who processed the scrap tire received consideration or compensation for the material because of its inherent value.
