Subject to subsections (b) and (c) below, the city will not accept any applications for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package in the DT Zoning District, and no licenses for the retail sale of distilled spirits by the package shall be issued in the DT Zoning District over the number of two.

(c)
If the city receives more applications than allotted licenses to be issued under this section which applications comply with the standards for the issuance of licenses for the sale of package distilled spirits in the DT Zoning District set forth in this chapter, then the selection of the successful application(s) shall be conducted by a lottery system overseen by an independent third party firm. The independent third party firm shall draw the names of all applicants who have qualified to enter into the lottery. The applications drawn from the lottery system shall be considered by the city council for approval according to the order in which they were drawn until all available licenses have been issued. If the city council denies an application for any reason, it shall consider the next application that was drawn in the lottery. The location for which the first license is issued shall be considered an "existing liquor store" for purposes of section 5-154(a)'s 500-yard minimum distance requirement. If the location for which the first license for the package sale of distilled beverages in the DT Zoning District is granted in a location that would prevent any other such license from being granted in the DT Zoning District, the total number of licenses allowed shall be reduced to one.
(1)
For example, if five applicants qualify for the lottery, the independent third party firm shall draw the names of all applicants and place them on a list ordered one through five. If application number one is granted a license and application number two's proposed location is within 500 yards of application number one's proposed location, application number two would be denied and the city council would consider application number three.
