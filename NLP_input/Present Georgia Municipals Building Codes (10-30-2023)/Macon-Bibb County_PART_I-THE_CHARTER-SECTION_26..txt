SECTION 26.
(a)
(1)
The mayor shall submit to the commission at least six weeks prior to the start of the fiscal year a budget message and a budget report, accompanied by a draft of the recommended appropriations ordinance, in a form and manner as may be prescribed by ordinance, which shall provide for the appropriation of the funds necessary to operate all the various departments and to meet the current expenses of the restructured government for the next fiscal year. Such ordinance must be approved by a two-thirds' majority vote of the commissioners then serving.
(2)
The commission shall annually appropriate the funds necessary to operate all the various departments and to meet the current expenses of the restructured government for the next fiscal year. The fiscal year of Macon-Bibb County shall be as determined by ordinance.
(b)
(1)
Each appropriations ordinance, as enacted or as amended from time to time, shall continue in force and effect for the next fiscal year after adoption and it shall then expire except for any mandatory appropriations required to meet contractual obligations or the continued appropriation and authorization of state or federal grants.
(2)
The commission shall not appropriate funds for any given fiscal year which, in aggregate, exceed a sum equal to the amount of unappropriated surplus expected to have accrued in the city treasury at the beginning of the fiscal year, together with an amount not greater than the total receipts from existing revenue sources anticipated to be collected in the fiscal year as determined by the mayor, less refunds as estimated in the budget report and amendments thereto.
(3)
All appropriated funds, except for the mandatory appropriations required by law and those required to meet contractual obligations or the continued appropriation and authorization of state or federal grants, remaining unexpended and not contractually obligated at the expiration of the appropriations ordinance shall lapse.
(4)
All state or federal funds received by Macon-Bibb County are by this charter continually appropriated in the exact amounts and for the purposes authorized and directed by the state or federal government in making the grant.
(c)
(1)
In addition to the appropriations made by the appropriations ordinance and amendments thereto, the commission may make additional appropriations in the same manner as provided in this charter, which shall be known as supplementary appropriations ordinances, provided that no supplementary appropriation shall be made unless there is an unappropriated surplus in the treasury of the restructured government or the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation has been collected into the general fund of the treasury as provided by law.
(2)
In no event shall a supplementary appropriations ordinance continue in force and effect beyond the expiration of the appropriations ordinance in effect when the supplementary appropriations ordinance was adopted and approved.
(d)
(1)
The appropriation for each department, office, bureau, board, commission, function, or line item for which appropriation is made shall be for a specific amount of money and no appropriation shall allocate to any object the proceeds of any particular tax or fund or a part or percentage thereof. All appropriations by function or line item shall be lump sum by function or line item.
(2)
Any appropriation made in conflict with the foregoing provisions shall be void.
