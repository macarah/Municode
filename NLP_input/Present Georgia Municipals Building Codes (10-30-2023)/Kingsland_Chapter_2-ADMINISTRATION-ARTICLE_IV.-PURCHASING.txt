Certain professions are also exempt. For a public contract, contractors must sign the contractor e-verify affidavit, all subcontractors must sign the subcontractor e-verify affidavit and all sub-subcontractors must sign the sub-subcontractor affidavit. The government agency is required to ensure that the contractor e-verify affidavit is part of the contract; however, the contractor is responsible for all subcontractor affidavits and the subcontractors are responsible for the sub-subcontractor's affidavits. E-verify is not required for contracts solely involving the purchase of goods by a government agency.
