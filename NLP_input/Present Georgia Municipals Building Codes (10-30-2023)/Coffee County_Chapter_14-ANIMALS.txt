The person having custody of a dog shall at all times provide the dog with necessary sustenance and shelter, and the failure to so do shall constitute a violation of this section and punishable pursuant to and in conformity with state law.

Any dog seized and impounded under any provisions of this article shall be detained for a period of seven days and if not claimed or redeemed by the owner or the person harboring the dog within such period shall be disposed of in such a manner as the officers or agents having custody of the impounded dog may designate. However, whenever the name of any person or identifying number appears on the collar of the dog so seized, such person shall be notified of such seizure by a postcard, addressed to him and deposited in the United States mail. The cost of redemption of any dog impounded hereunder shall be the sum, set forth in the schedule of fees and charges and maintained in the office of the county clerk, per day while impounded. Prior to the redemption of any dog by the owner or custodian, he must show evidence that the dog has a current rabies inoculation. In the absence of such evidence, the owner or custodian must pay additional fees, as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges and maintained in the office of the county clerk, to the county, including, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 31-19-7, a $0.50 fee for each dog inoculated to offset the cost of the salary for the county rabies control officer; and a receipt will be issued by the animal shelter which, when presented to a veterinarian, the necessary inoculation will be given without further charge to the owner and custodian. The dog owner and custodian will bring evidence of inoculation immediately to the animal shelter for confirmation of the redemption requirement. The animal shelter will then reimburse the veterinarian with the inoculation fee so collected.
