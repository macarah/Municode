ARTICLE XXI - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Section 2101. - Intent.
It is the intent of the planned development district to permit and encourage the development of property which would:

3.
Permit the establishment or mixture of uses which, without proper design and planning, might not be compatible with surrounding uses or zoning districts.
Section 2102. - Utilization.
This district is to be utilized as a "floating zone" which shall mean that areas will not be predesignated as planned development districts, but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment. Planned development districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the same amendment procedures as other districts. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and the land uses which are presented with the application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of the zoning regulations particular to that development.
Section 2103. - General conditions.
An area may be considered for rezoning to planned development district is any one (1) of the following conditions exist:
1.
The characteristics of the specific site plan and uses proposed for the subject property would only be compatible with the surrounding area if the development were limited to those plans and uses as submitted.
2.
Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same zoning district, are proposed for development on one (1) or more adjacent parcels under single or separate ownership.

All proposed planned development district applications shall conform to the following specific requirements:
1.
The site proposed for planned development district classifications must contain an area of not less than two (2) acres. In no case shall the minimum lot size be less than two (2) acres unless specifically approved by the Town Council due to special and unusual circumstances.
