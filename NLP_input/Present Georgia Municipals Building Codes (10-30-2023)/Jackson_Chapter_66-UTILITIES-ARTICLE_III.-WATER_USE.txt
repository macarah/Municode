(e)
Water rates. The rate schedule used for the city is set from time to time. However, water rates will not increase without 30 days' notice to the consumer.

(a)
Reading schedule. The water meter serving the consumer's property shall be read on a monthly basis and official records of each reading thereof shall be kept for a period of one year.
(b)
Meter designation. Water meters shall be classified as either active meters, inactive meters and canceled meters. These designations are defined as follows:
(1)
Active meters are defined as meters that are in normal use. All active meters will be charged on a monthly basis.
(2)
Inactive meters are defined as meters that are installed where the consumer has notified the city in writing to temporarily terminate service. When it receives such written request, the city will seal the meter and declare the meter an inactive meter. When no responsible party is available to request inactive meter designation for the consumer, the city may declare the meter inactive. If a consumer desires to obtain water services after the meter has been declared inactive, the consumer shall pay the city a deposit and reconnection fee. In addition, the consumer must pay any previous unpaid bills which that consumer had through the city's services prior to obtaining any additional service from the city. Once the deposit, connection fee and any past due bills have been paid, the meter will be reclassified as an active meter as defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
(3)
Canceled meters are defined as meters that have not been in use where the consumer has notified the city that no further water service from the city is desired. The city may, on its own initiative, declare a meter canceled when water has not been used for a period of 12 months or longer, excluding fire lines. If a meter is declared a canceled meter, the meter will be removed and the connection sealed. A consumer desiring reconnection of a canceled meter shall pay the deposit and connection fee that is in effect as of the date of application.

Billing schedule. Bills are sent out on the first day of each month. Bills shall be paid by the tenth day of each month. Payments received after the tenth will be assessed a ten percent late fee. If no payment is received, service will be discontinued on the 21st day of the month. If water service is disconnected for nonpayment of the bill, the city will not resume water service to the consumer until the bill, reconnection fees and all penalties have been paid in full. If the tenth day of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, when city hall is closed, payments will be accepted without late charge on the following workday when city hall is open.
(c)
Billing errors. If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, this claim must be presented to the city, or its billing agent, before the bill becomes due. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in this section. The customer may pay such bill under protest and such payment shall not prejudice his claim. Any consumer who fails to notify the city in writing within 30 days after the date of such bill of any irregularities or errors that may be in such bill shall waive any right or claim for correction or refund under such bill.
(d)
Meter failure. If the seal of a meter is broken by any person other than the city's representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly, or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount which is the average for the preceding month's water usage.
