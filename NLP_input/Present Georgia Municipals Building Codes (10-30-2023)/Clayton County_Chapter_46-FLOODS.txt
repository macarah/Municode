DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 46-26. - Statutory authorization.
The state legislature has in the Planning Enabling Legislation of 1957, as amended, article 9, section 5-2, part 1 of the constitution of the state, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners does ordain as following to be its regulations governing flood damage prevention.
(Code 1973, § 2-26-1)
Sec. 46-27. - Findings of facts.
The board of commissioners hereby finds that:
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Code 1973, § 2-26-2)
Sec. 46-28. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protection barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Code 1973, § 2-26-3)
Sec. 46-29. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Code 1973, § 2-26-4)

Repetitive loss means flood related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
NOTE: Inclusion of this definition allows policyholders to avail ICC portion of the flood claim under the repetitive loss declaration by the community in addition to one time substantial flood damage declaration by the community. However, if adopted, the community will need to track the flood damages over the 10-year periods.
Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located.
Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
Structure means, for insurance purposes: (1) A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; (2) A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure; built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or (3) A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 46-66. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
Floodway fringe.
a.
Generally. The floodway fringe is a specific area that is located in some sections of some 100-year floodplains in which encroachments and/or developments may be allowed. All encroachments, development or construction activities within a designated floodway fringe are regulated by one or more of several different types of permits. Rules that are contained in this article, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the National Flood Insurance Program (FEMA), or other state or local laws may apply to regulations governing development in the floodway fringe area. Property owners are responsible for reviewing all regulations and obtaining the necessary permits before the various activity begins in the floodway fringe. The floodway fringe areas are only those areas designated and identified on FEMA boundary and floodway maps. These areas are normally located adjacent to the regulated floodway and also between the limits of the floodway and the outer boundary of the area of special flood hazard. The following regulations apply to earthwork that is required for fill or foundations of structures, buildings or encroachments in the floodway fringe. Other earthwork that would be associated with other approved uses of the floodway fringe will be considered and approved based upon the acceptability of the design and materials specified. Some of the other uses are open space, parks, recreational areas, vehicle parking and agricultural uses.
b.
Earthwork. Land used for construction of any building or structure within the floodway fringe shall be raised a minimum of two vertical feet above the base flood elevation. The fill area shall include that land to be occupied by the proposed building or structure and the additional adjacent land in all directions for a distance of 20 feet beyond the building site. The fill shall be constructed of material that is free of debris and boulders and that is suitable for embankment. The fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform layers not more than six inches in thickness. These layers shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density. The fill area shall be sloped to provide adequate drainage. The area shall be stabilized to prevent erosion by seeding, sodding or other approved methods.
(2)
Anchoring of new construction/substantial improvements. New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
(3)
Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
(4)
Resistance to flood damage. New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
(5)
Methods/practices for new construction/substantial improvements. New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(6)
Protection of service facilities, etc., from water damage. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
(7)
Protection of water supply systems. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
(8)
Protection of sanitary sewer systems. New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the system into floodwaters.
(9)

In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 46-32 or section 46-55, the following provisions are required:
(1)
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwater shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 46-53.
(3)
Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
b.
Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).

A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures.
(5)
Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-32 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b.
If subsection (5)a. of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection 46-66 and the elevation standards of subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (5)a. of this section are met.
(Code 1973, § 2-26-19)

Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection 46-117(2) below.
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Clayton County Department of Transportation and Development until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the Clayton County Water Authority.

Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Clayton County Board of Commissioners may appeal such decision to the Magistrate Court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(4)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the Clayton County Water Authority (jurisdiction) and Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(8)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation.
d.
The Clerk of the Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, both granted and denied, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Clayton County Water Authority (jurisdiction) and Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
