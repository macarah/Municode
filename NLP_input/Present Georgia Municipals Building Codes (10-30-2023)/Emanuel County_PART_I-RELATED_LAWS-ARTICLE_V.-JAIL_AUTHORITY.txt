There is created a body corporate and politic to be known as the Emanuel County Jail Authority, which shall be deemed to be a political subdivision of the State of Georgia and a public corporation and instrumentality by that name, style, and title, and said body may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts of law and equity, except that the authority or the trustee acting under a trust indenture shall in no event be liable for any torts committed by any of the officers, agents, and employees of the authority. The authority shall not be a state institution, nor a department or agency of the state, but shall be an instrumentality of the state, a mere creation of the state, having a distinct corporate entity and being exempt from the provisions of [O.C.G.A. § 50-17-20 et seq.], the "Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission Act." The authority shall have its principal office in Emanuel County, and its legal situs or residence for the purposes of this Act shall be Emanuel County. The authority is granted the same exemptions and exclusions from taxes as are now granted to cities and counties for the operation of facilities similar to facilities to be operated by the authority as provided under the provisions of this Act.

A majority of the authority shall constitute a quorum.
(c)
One member of the Board of Commissioners of Emanuel County may be appointed to serve as a member of the authority.

(f)
The authority shall elect one of its members as chairperson and another member as vice chairperson. The clerk of the Board of Commissioners of Emanuel County shall be the secretary and treasurer. Said clerk shall not be a member of the authority.
(g)
Three members of the authority shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the Authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority.

The members of the authority shall be reimbursed for all actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties out of the funds of the authority.
(i)
The authority shall make rules and regulations for its own government. It shall have perpetual existence.

Any office so vacated shall be filled by appointment by the Board of Commissioners of Emanuel County.
