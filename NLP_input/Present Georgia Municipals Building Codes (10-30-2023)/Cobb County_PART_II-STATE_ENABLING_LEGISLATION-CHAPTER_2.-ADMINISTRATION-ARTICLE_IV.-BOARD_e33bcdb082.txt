Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by an authority shall be paid solely from the property (including but not limited to real property, fixtures, personal property, revenues, or other funds) pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered to secure or to pay such bonds, notes, or other obligations. All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the directors of the authority at a regular or special meeting. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates; shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their respective dates; shall bear interest at such rate or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time); shall be subject to redemption on such terms; and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide.

The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this division.

There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which any authority may issue. Any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, page 761) (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.), as now or hereafter amended, the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of an authority.

Sec. 2-166. - Same—Provisions; limitations; use of proceeds; form; validation.

(b)
The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by an authority shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted in this division, all or part of the cost of any project or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with the provisions of this division.
(c)
Issuance by an authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects, but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
(d)
The authority shall have the power and is authorized, whenever bonds of the authority shall have been validated as provided in this division, to issue from time to time its notes in anticipation of such bonds as validated and to renew from time to time any such notes by the issuance of new notes, whether the notes to be renewed have or have not matured. The authority may issue such bond anticipation notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. Such notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the authority may sell such notes at public or private sale. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the authority is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing bonds of the authority or any issue thereof; and the authority may include in any notes any terms, covenants, or conditions which the authority is authorized to include in any bonds. Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of such notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which they are to be issued.
(e)
All bonds issued by the authority under this division shall be issued and validated under and in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law, as heretofore and hereafter amended, except as provided in this division, provided that notes and other obligations of the authority may, but shall not be required to, be so validated.
(1)
Bonds issued by an authority may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide.
(2)
Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior court of the judicial circuit in which the issuing authority is located may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution stating the date on which such bonds were validated, and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(3)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which bonds to be issued by an authority are to bear, the notice to the district attorney or attorney general; the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing; and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) specified in such notices and petition and complaint or that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, that none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(4)
The term "cost of the project" or "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this division whenever referred to in bond resolutions of an authority; in bonds, notes, or other obligations of an authority; or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of an authority.
