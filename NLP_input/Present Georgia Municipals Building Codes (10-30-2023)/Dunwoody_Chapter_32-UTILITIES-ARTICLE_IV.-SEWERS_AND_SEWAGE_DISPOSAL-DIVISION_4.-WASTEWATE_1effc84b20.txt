DIVISION 4. - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS

Sec. 32-287. - Penalties and enforcement.
(a)
Upon determination that a violation of this division has occurred, the director shall serve upon that discharger a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific actions, shall be submitted by the violator to the department. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
The director may order a discharger which has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this division to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served by registered or certified mail, or by personal service on the user or the authorized representative of the user. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the discharger. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the discharger.
(c)
When the director finds that a discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this division or that the discharger's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the discharger directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the discharger to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation and to prevent recurrence of the violation.
Each day of violation of a cease and desist order, after notice thereof, shall constitute a violation of this division, and shall constitute a separate violation of this division, subject to the maximum fine or imprisonment, or both, set forth in section 1-6.
(d)
Violation of the provisions of this division constitutes an infraction subject to a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days for any single offense, in accordance with section 1-6. The city or county may institute appropriate action or proceedings at law or equity for the enforcement of this division or to correct violations of this division. Any court of competent jurisdiction may have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions and other appropriate forms of remedy or relief. Each day of noncompliance is considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city or the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including application for injunctive relief.
(e)
When the director finds that a discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, the director may petition the courts for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the requirements imposed by this division on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the discharger to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking other action against a discharger.
(f)
The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city or the county, including, but not limited to, containment, cleanup, injury, death and other.

(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 4, § 4)
Sec. 32-292. - Expiration and renewal.
(a)
Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed three years. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 120 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. If no new local, state or federal pretreatment requirements are impending on the user and the user has had no violation of the existing permit, the permit shall be renewed for a time period at least equal to the existing permit. All other expiring permits shall be reviewed and revised or renewed as determined by the director. Should a timely applied for permit expire before issuance of a new permit by the county, the existing permit shall continue in force until the new permit is issued.
(b)
Discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation and normally are not transferable to any succeeding user or the current user for a new operation. Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 60 days' advance notice to the director and the director approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the director must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
(1)
States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes;
(2)
Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
(3)
Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 4, § 5)

(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 25, art. III, div. 4, § 15)
Sec. 32-302. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Upset.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred, and the user can identify the causes of the upset;
b.
The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost, or fails.
(b)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 32-325(a) or the specific prohibitions in section 32-325(b)(3) through (b)(7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permits, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section,
a.
The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Prior notice.
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
Enforcement action or approval.
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
1.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section.
b.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section.
