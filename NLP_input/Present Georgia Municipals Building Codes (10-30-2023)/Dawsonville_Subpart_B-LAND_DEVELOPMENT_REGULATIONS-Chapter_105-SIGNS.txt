Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an application containing a false material statement or omission, the director of planning and zoning shall revoke said application and the subject sign shall be removed.

(2)
In the following circumstances, the director of planning and zoning may bind over a decision on a sign permit application to the mayor and council of the City of Dawsonville:

(2)
At the conclusion of the public hearing, the mayor and council shall render a decision on the sign permit application, and in so doing shall direct the director of planning and zoning for the city to either issue the permit, issue the permit with conditions, or deny the permit.

Unless inconsistent with the procedures outlined by this chapter, such appeals will follow the requirements and procedures defined in the Zoning Ordinance of the city.

A variance may be granted in an individual case of extreme and unusual hardship upon a finding by the city council that the following conditions exist:
a.
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
b.
The failure of the city council to allow a variance would deprive the applicant of a right currently enjoyed by other similar properties in the city.
c.
Granting the variance request will not confer upon the property of the applicant significant privileges which are denied to other similar properties in the city.
d.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
e.
The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning districts involved.

b.
For purposes of this section, "ceases operations" shall refer to those situations where there is substantial evidence that a business or activity has vacated the building or grounds; provided further that this section shall not apply to any case where a business or activity is temporarily suspended and there is evidence that the business or activity will resume operations within a specifically designated period.

All discontinued signs, with the exception of pylon signs and monument signs, shall be removed within 30 days from the date of discontinuance.

a.
If a discontinued monument sign contains a message panel that is removable from the monument structure without disassembling the monument, then within 30 days of the date of discontinuance said panel shall be removed and the portion of the monument structure that previously held the message panel shall be covered with durable cloth, canvas or other suitable material for the pertinent sign which material shall be approved by the director of planning and zoning to avoid the appearance of blight, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and an approved sign panel is installed in said monument.
b.
If a discontinued monument sign contains a sign copy area that is not removable without disassembling the monument, then said sign copy area shall be modified (e.g., painted over or covered with durable cloth, canvas or other suitable material for the pertinent sign which material shall be approved by the director of planning and zoning), so that the sign copy pertaining to the business or activity discontinued is no longer visible, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and approved sign copy is affixed on the sign copy area of said monument.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. II, § 12)
Sec. 105-13. - Maintenance of signs.

The director of planning and zoning or his designee will give the owner 30 days written notice to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign or signs, except signs which pose a threat to public safety which shall be removed in accord with section 105-17. Said written notice may be made by U.S. Mail sent to the permit holder and owner of the property upon which the sign is located at the address on file with the city. The director of the department of planning and zoning may remove or cause to be removed after written notice to the permit holder and property owner at the address on file with the city any sign that has not been timely removed after being discontinued as set forth in section 105-12, or which shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated, or in the opinion of the director or his designees poses a threat to public safety. If the owner refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the director of planning and zoning or his designee will have the sign removed, and the city shall be entitled to a lien for the cost of removal against the lot or parcel upon which the sign existed before removal.

(b)
All permits issued for signs under this chapter shall be conditioned upon the land owner, permit holder and their successors and assigns being bound to incur said relocation costs and waiving any claim of damages or vested rights in the sign due to road or right-of-way expansion which requires relocation or total loss of the sign. All sign permit applications and all sign permits shall have the following legend imprinted thereon: Acceptance of this permit and erection of the sign approved herewith shall irrevocably bind the owner of the land, the permit holder, their successors and assigns (hereinafter collectively the "permit holder") to pay any and all costs of relocation of the sign in the event that the city or other governmental entity expands the road or right-of-way adjacent to the sign. The permit holder agrees that it acquires no vested rights in the sign on the property location and agrees to make no claim for condemnation, inverse condemnation or other loss or damage as a result of the inability of permit holder to maintain a sign at this location. The permit holder agrees that the permit is a conditional license that may be revoked by the city at any time due to the need for road or other utility improvements, and that the permit holder has taken all of these factors into consideration when buying or leasing the land upon which the sign will be located and when designing, constructing and maintaining the sign.

Sec. 105-15. - Enforcement.
This article shall be administered and enforced by the director of planning and zoning or his or her designee as follows:

Sec. 105-36. - Expression signs.

For example, in a political race, a maximum of two political campaign signs supporting the same candidate for the same office shall be allowed per lot. This provision is not intended to limit the overall number of expression signs per lot. For example, in a political campaign season, one lot may permissibly contain more than two political signs, as long as no more than two signs contain the same or similar expressive message supporting the same candidate for the same office. This provision is in no way intended to regulate the content of expression signs, but is rather a measure to reasonably limit the duplication of the same message in a manner that creates visual blight and causes distraction to those passing by.
(5)
Expression signs are subject to the additional regulations, if any, of the zoning district in which the sign is placed.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 6)

Sec. 105-41. - Temporary signage.
(a)
It is the policy of the city as outlined in this article to regulate the use of temporary signage. Temporary signage is often poorly constructed, poorly maintained, and located in a manner than obscures traffic signs, views of intersections of public and private streets and driveways, and tends to depreciate the scenic beauty and quality of life of the community by creating visual clutter. Temporary signage has a place in the community for specialized purposes, such as announcing properties for sale or lease, construction activities, or temporary sales. Temporary signage is permitted subject to the regulations of this article.
(b)
Temporary signs are those signs which are installed with the intent of displaying them continuously for more than 24 hours, but which are not related to a permanent land use on the property and are not intended to be displayed permanently. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the following regulations on size, placement and location:
(1)
Size. Temporary signs shall not exceed five square feet in area.
(2)
Location. Temporary signs are permitted, provided that they are located in minimum of 20 feet back from the edge of the curb, or edge of pavement where there is no curb, of the street on which the sign fronts. If this 20-foot distance would be within a structure, the sign may be within three feet of the front of the structure. Signs must be parallel to the streets on which the building fronts and placed in front of the front facade with the building as a backdrop. Signs may be positioned in the side yard. Signs may be displayed through windows or other glass areas. On vacant lots, where there is no structure, the sign shall be approximately centered on the lot, and shall maintain the 20-foot setback from the edge of the curb or edge of pavement where there is no curb.
(3)
Height. No portion of the sign shall extend more than five feet above the existing ground level at the location of the sign. Mounting devices may extend above the sign by not more than six inches.
(4)
Number. Only one temporary sign is permitted on any one parcel of property. To the extent that any restriction contained herein is inconsistent with state law, said state law shall control.
(5)
Mounting devices. Temporary signs shall be mounted on hardware of wood or painted metal, and no part of the mounting structure shall be greater than four inches by four inches in cross-section. Mounting hardware shall be painted or stained in earth tones. Further, no message may be written on the mounting hardware so that the entire message area of the sign is contained on the sign face itself.
(6)
Lighting prohibited. No temporary sign may be illuminated in any manner.
(7)
Time and fees. Temporary signs shall only be permitted for a one-month time period which may be renewed for up to 12 months total and shall pay a fee of $30.00 per month or such fee as may be established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council of the city.
(8)
Maintenance. Temporary signs shall be maintained as provided in this chapter, and it shall be a violation of this article to permit a temporary sign to fall into disrepair.
(9)
Exceptions. Where there are conditions such as heavy vegetation on the property, or extremely steep terrain that makes the sign placement standards of this section impractical because the sign is not visible from the street, the city may grant an exception of the sign setback standards, but not the size or street orientation standards. In no event may temporary signs subject to the setback requirements be placed within the public right-of-way.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 11)
Sec. 105-42. - Banners—Over public property.

(2)
The banner may only be displayed immediately prior to and during a community event which it advertises, and in no case shall the banner be displayed for more than 30 days or more than ten days after the event.

(7)
Prices or fees charged for the event shall not be displayed.
(8)
Banners shall be hung or displayed in a manner that does not interfere with or impede traffic or interfere with or obscure traffic signs or control devices.
(9)
The owners of a banner shall agree to assume full liability and indemnify the city for any damage to persons or property arising from the display of the banner by the city.
(10)
If the banner is not picked up from the city by the applicant or sponsor within ten days after it has been taken down, the banner shall become the property of the city and will be disposed of.
(11)
Banners should be received by the city one week prior to the date of scheduled display.
(12)
The city is not responsible for any damage that may occur to the banner from any cause.
(13)
No banner may be hung over a state highway absent written permission from the Georgia Department of Transportation.
A fee shall be payable to the city when the banner is dropped off at the city before its reservation commences to cover manpower costs associated with installation and removal of the banner. A fee of $30.00 per month, or as may be established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council of the city, shall be charged and must be paid for each banner sign permit.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 12)

a.
Height limit. Freestanding signs are limited to low-profile signs which may not exceed a height of five feet.
b.
Design. Freestanding monument signs with solid or enclosed bases are permitted where approved. Signs supported by at least two poles without enclosed based are also permitted, provided that the exposed poles' height does not constitute more than 50 percent of the overall height; i.e., the height of the open area beneath a sign cannot exceed 50 percent of the sign's total height. Single pole signs are not considered appropriate in the historical district or the urban redevelopment plan area except in the case where a single pole is used in conjunction with a horizontal cross-bar to support hanging signs on one side of the pole only subject to the projection and clearance provisions defined in subsection [105-74(9)].
c.
Size. Freestanding signs shall be limited to a maximum of 32 square feet in area.
d.
Density. Businesses, projects, or parcels are limited to one freestanding sign, except that properties with more than 100 feet of continuous frontage and with more than one entrance may, subject to city approval, install a freestanding sign at each entrance, provided that the combined square footage of all freestanding signs does not exceed 64 square feet (two 32-square-foot signs). Where there is frontage on more than one street, each frontage is treated independently, provided that no two signs may be closer than 100 feet to one another. Signage area may not be transferred from one frontage to another.
e.
Location and orientation. Freestanding signs are subject to the location requirements of the city.
f.
Content. Freestanding signs are limited to on-premises signs and signs displaying noncommercial messages.
(2)
Window signs. Permanent window signs may be placed in or upon any window, provided that no more than 75 percent of the total transparent area of the window or windows combined is obscured.
(3)
Wall signs. Wall signs may be placed upon a building; provided, that they meet the size, material, content, location, and other standards of this article. Wall signs shall be placed so as to utilize existing architectural features of a building without obscuring them. Wall signs shall be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles within close proximity.
(4)
Projecting signs. No single projecting sign may exceed 18 square feet in area or may project more than 36 inches from the face of the building to which it is attached. Projecting signs must have at least eight feet of ground clearance and cannot be higher than the building to which they are attached. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the city council.
(5)
Hanging signs. A hanging sign may be placed on a building or underneath an approved canopy, awning, or colonnade as long as it does not project beyond the same. It must have a least eight feet of ground clearance. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the city council.
(6)
Awnings. Awnings are permitted as signage, provided they blend with the architecture of the building and do not obscure details of the building. Awnings should serve as an accent to the building's design but should not be the dominant architectural feature. Awnings are counted as signage if they have lettering or other graphics.
a.
Signage area. Only 20 percent of any one face of an awning may be used for signage regardless of the size of the building facade to which the sign applies.
b.
Material. Only canvas will be permitted. Material should be high quality, colorfast, and surface resistant. Vinyl or plastic materials are not considered appropriate.
c.
Color. Awning colors are generally limited to a single field color with a single contrasting color for lettering and may be used only if they conform to color requirements as specified in section 105-74 of this article.
d.
Illumination. Illuminated (backlit) translucent awnings or translucent letters on opaque backgrounds are not appropriate and are not permitted. Canvas awnings illuminated in the traditional manner with incandescent lighting are permitted.
e.
Clearance and projection. Awnings must have a minimum of eight feet of clearance from the ground to the frame or valance.
f.
Location of awnings. Awnings must be located in a traditional manner above doors and windows. All other locations are prohibited.
(7)
Illuminated signs. Illuminated signs are permitted subject to the provisions of subsection 105-74(f).
(8)
Changeable copy signs. Changeable copy signs may only be used in conjunction with theaters, entertainment facilities, nonprofit art galleries, or similar exhibit facilities permitted in the historical district. Changeable copy signs are allowed for all facilities in the urban redevelopment plan area.
(9)
Directory signs. Directory signs shall be permitted to provide information for multitenant projects. Multitenant projects may have a maximum of 32 square feet of signage area to serve as a directory for a project. The contents of such signs shall be limited to the name of the tenants of the project, address or suite number, and telephone numbers. Signs shall be located in the common area of the project and oriented toward a central pedestrian path or common parking area. No rental or sales information shall be permitted on the directory sign. A directory sign does not constitute a primary or secondary sign.
(10)
Menu display. Menus for restaurants may be displaced on the inside of windows of a restaurant or inside a wall-mounted box. The maximum size shall be three square feet. If a display box is used, it must be constructed to coordinate with the building design, must contain a clear face which would protect the menu from the weather, and must not extend over public property. Chalk or erasable boards are exempt from the clear face coverage requirement. A menu display does not constitute a primary or secondary sign. If any information other than the menu is incorporated into the menu display, then this would constitute a primary or secondary sign.
(12)
Temporary signs. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the requirements of section 105-75.
(13)
Expression signs. Expression signs are governed by O.C.G.A. § 16-7-58, and shall be allowed without the necessity of obtaining a permit, subject to the following:
a.
No such sign shall be located on any public right-of-way, and it must be on private property with the consent of the property owner.
b.
For identification purposes the owner of said sign shall stamp or write legibly its name and contact information on the backside or in a corner or margin of the sign.
c.
In order to confirm legitimacy of sign placement, the owner of every expression sign shall stamp or write legibly on the backside or corner of the sign the name of the property owner providing authorization for placement of the sign and a telephone number of that property owner.
d.
Any expression sign in the historical district or urban redevelopment plan area with an area of the sign larger than ten square feet shall require a sign permit and shall be subject to the regulations of this article.
(14)
Home occupation signs. A professional or business nameplate which designates a legally operating home occupation.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 3)
Sec. 105-74. - Design and location standards.
All regulated signs must comply with the following design standards:
(1)
Size requirements. The total area of all permanent signs, including, but not limited to, freestanding signs, window signs, wall signs, projecting signs, and hanging signs, shall not exceed 50 square feet per business. There shall be no more than one primary, and one secondary sign per business. A secondary sign is one that is smaller than the primary sign.
(2)
Area of sign. The area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character together with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such writing, representation, emblem or any figure of similar character from the background against which it is placed. For double-faced signs, both sides shall be measured and added together and divided by two in computing the sign area.
(3)
Signage plans. Buildings or clusters of buildings having more than one tenant or use shall provide a signage plan for the entire structure or project to be reviewed and approved by the director of planning and zoning prior to erection of any sign. The signage plan must be designed so that it establishes a common theme or design, uses similar construction methods, and has compatible colors, lettering, lettering style, symbols, scale and size of signs, and/or identical background. Signage plans for office buildings must have their primary focus on the identification of the building, and individual tenants may be identified by using small lettering on a window or door or directories. Total signage area within the plan is subject to the maximum size limitation of this article. Signage area cannot be transferred to a single building or facade from other buildings in the project.
(4)
Sign materials. Exposed surfaces of signs may be constructed of metal, glass, stone, concrete, brick, cloth, or wood.
(5)
Color. Signs must be finished in subdued earthtone colors. Earthtones may be defined in this context to include the full spectrum of soil and clay colors. Spectrums of off-whites to deep browns and light grays to black provide a wide range of acceptable colors. Brighter colors may be used, provided they are imbued with brown or black tones. For example, pink imbued with brown would tend toward mauve and would be acceptable. Bright reds imbued with brown or black tones give a deeper burgundy or maroon color and may also be acceptable. Colors should complement the color scheme of the building. In no case will "day-glo," fluorescent, reflective colored materials that give the appearance of changing color, or brilliant luminescent colors be permitted.
(6)
Illumination.
a.
Externally illuminated signs. Light fixtures for externally illuminated signs must be simple in form and mounted so they do not obscure building ornamentation. The light fixtures should emphasize the continuity of the building surface and should not clutter the building in an unorganized manner. Spot lights and floodlights shall be directed only at the sign surface. Light shall not be directed off the property. No exposed light sources are allowed, and all light sources must be shaded to contain light rays to the sign. Colored lighting is prohibited.
b.
Internally illuminated signs. This type of sign is not considered appropriate in the historical district and is prohibited.
(7)
Type styles. Only type styles in use in the United States between 1830 and 1910 may be accepted in the historical district.
(8)
Location on building. Architectural details of a building often suggest a location, size, or shape for a sign. Signage should complement the architectural details of the building. Signs should help to establish a visual continuity with adjacent store fronts and relate directly to the store entrance. Signs must be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles in close proximity. Signs shall be designed and located on the building or on the premises in a manner that is compatible with the mass and scale of the building to which the sign applies. Signs must not obscure architectural details of the building nor cover doors, windows, or other integral elements of the facade. Signs shall not obstruct views of nearby intersection and driveways.
(9)
Projection and clearance. No sign may project more than 36 inches from the face of a building or pole. Projecting and hanging signs must maintain at least eight feet of clearance from ground level. Signs may extend over city property only with the written approval of the city council.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 4; Ord. of 6-16-2014; Ord. of 9-8-2014)
Sec. 105-75. - Types of signs prohibited.
In addition to those signs prohibited in section 105-45, the following types of signs are prohibited in the historical district and the urban redevelopment plan area:
(1)
Electronic message signs. A permanent, freestanding roof, wall, or other sign which changes copy electronically using switches and electric lamps. Automatic changing signs, such as public service and time, temperature, and date signage are prohibited.
(2)
Off-premises freestanding signs and billboards. A permanent outdoor sign which directs attention to a building, profession, product, service, industry, entertainment, or other activity not conducted, sold, or offered on the premises upon which the sign is located or to which it is affixed.
(3)

(4)
Animated signs. A rotating or revolving sign or signs where all or a portion of the signs moves in some manner.
(5)
Wind signs. Any propeller, whirling, or similar device which is designed to flutter, rotate, or display other movement under the influence of the wind. This shall include "gasoline flags" or banners.
(6)

(7)
Illuminated awnings. Illuminated (backlit), translucent, awnings are not considered appropriate and are prohibited.
(8)

(9)
Neon signs. Neon used to draw attention to a business or building in any manner, including, but not limited to, neon text, logos, or outlining of a building's architectural features, is not considered appropriate in the historical district and is therefore prohibited. Neon may be used as an accent to signage in the urban redevelopment plan area, such as an "open" sign done in neon, but may not be the primary signage for a building.
(Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 5)
