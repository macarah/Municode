The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."

(O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority.
(2)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.
(3)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this ordinance together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien.

(7)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(8)
The failure to abate or remove such nuisance as required by this article shall allow the judge of the municipal court to enforce such failure as an offense and/or as a violation of the city ordinances and issue such fines or other enforcement as allowed by the city Charter for the enforcement of violations of city ordinances and the laws of the state.
