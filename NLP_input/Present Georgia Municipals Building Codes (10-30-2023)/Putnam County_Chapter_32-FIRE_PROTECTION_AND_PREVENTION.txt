(h)
Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work or operation shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing, unless such application has been diligently prosecuted or a permit shall have been issued, except that the fire marshal is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each if there is reasonable cause.
(i)
Action on application. The fire marshal, in conjunction with the building official, shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the fire marshal shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the fire marshal is satisfied that the proposed work or operation conforms to the requirements of this chapter and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the fire marshal shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.
(j)
Conditions of a permit. A permit shall constitute permission to maintain, store or handle materials; or to conduct processes which produce conditions hazardous to life or property; or to install equipment utilized in connection with such activities; or to install or modify any fire protection system or equipment or any other construction, equipment installation or modification in accordance with the provisions of this Code where a permit is required by this chapter. Such permission shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or set aside any of the provisions of this chapter or other applicable regulations or laws of the jurisdiction.
(k)
Expiration. An operational permit shall remain in effect until reissued, renewed, or revoked or for such a period of time as specified in the permit. Construction permits shall automatically become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. Before such work recommences, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee to recommence work, if any, shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. Permits are not transferable and any change in occupancy, operation, tenancy or ownership shall require that a new permit be issued.
(l)
Extensions. A permittee holding an unexpired permit shall have the right to apply for an extension of the time within which the permittee will commence work under that permit when work is unable to be commenced within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The fire marshal is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more extensions of the time period of a permit for periods of not more than 90 days each. Such extensions shall be requested by the permit holder in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.
(m)
Occupancy prohibited before approval. The building or structure shall not be occupied prior to the fire marshal issuing a permit that indicates that applicable provisions of this chapter have been met.
(n)
Conditional permits. Where permits are required and upon the request of a permit applicant, the fire marshal is authorized to issue a conditional permit to occupy the premises or portion thereof before the entire work or operations on the premises is completed, provided that such portion or portions will be occupied safely prior to full completion or installation of equipment and operations without endangering life or public welfare. The fire marshal shall notify the permit applicant in writing of any limitations or restrictions necessary to keep the permit area safe. The holder of a conditional permit shall proceed only to the point for which approval has been given, at the permit holder's own risk and without assurance that approval for the occupancy or the utilization of the entire premises, equipment or operations will be granted.
(o)
Posting the permit. Issued permits shall be kept on the premises designated therein at all times and shall be readily available for inspection by the fire marshal.
(p)
Compliance with chapter. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the fire marshal from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. Any addition to or alteration of approved construction documents shall be approved in advance by the fire marshal, as evidenced by the issuance of a new or amended permit.
(q)
Information on the permit. The fire marshal shall issue all permits required by this chapter on an approved form furnished for that purpose. The permit shall contain a general description of the operation or occupancy and its location and any other information required by the fire marshal. Issued permits shall bear the signature of the fire marshal or other designated fire official.
(r)
Revocation. The fire marshal is authorized to revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter when it is found by inspection or otherwise that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation as to the material facts in the application or construction documents on which the permit or approval was based including, but not limited to, any one of the following:
(1)
The permit is used for a location or establishment other than that for which it was issued.

(6)
The permittee failed, refused or neglected to comply with orders or notices duly served in accordance with the provisions of this Code within the time provided therein.
(7)
The permit was issued in error or in violation of an ordinance, regulation or this Code.
(s)
