Sec. 58-1. - Purpose and scope.
This chapter, "Signs" establishes standards and regulations for the placement of signs which are displayed for public viewing within the city;
Whereas, the mayor and city council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance and
Whereas, regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.

APPENDIX B
1.
Applicants for certificates of appropriateness are required to conform to design guidelines requirements for type of materials, size of signs and lettering, and number of colors to be used. In addition, applicants will be required to limit the variety of typefaces or fonts displayed on signs to the following.
2.
These guidelines do not apply to the applicants' logos. If an applicant has used a logo and does not wish to change the logo to conform to the guidelines, the logo may appear on the sign as it does on the applicant's business card or letterhead. The applicant must furnish the historic preservation commission with a piece of letterhead stationery or a business card for purposes of consideration by the commission.
3.
Architectural features.
a.
Preserve, maintain, or restore all original decorative features and detailing. This includes columns, pilasters, corbelling, patterned brickwork, cornices, window hoods, lintels, etc.
b.
When replacing missing features, the original design, materials, size, and placement of the historic feature will be reproduced.
c.
If there are no photographs available to document a missing historic architectural feature, a simpler design of accurate scale found on building types of the same style and period will be used in the rehabilitation.
d.
Non-historic decorative features and detailing should not be added to the building since they create an inaccurate historic appearance.
e.
When repairing historic features, compatible materials and craftsmanship should be used to prevent additional damage to the architectural detailing.
4.
Signs and awnings.
a.
Preserve, maintain, or restore historic signs and awnings where they originally were located.
b.
New awnings should be traditional and historically accurate for the time period of the building. They may be of a retractable or fixed type; of canvas, vinyl coated, or acrylic material; individually located within major window openings; and designed to fit the shape and size of the specific window opening. For further design assistance, contact the Main Street manager or the historic preservation commission.
c.
Modern metal and backlit awnings are not permitted.
d.
Canvas may be used to cover an existing metal awning.
e.
Canopies should not be used unless they are required for business purposes.
f.
Signs should be used in a historic location such as storefront bellcourses, flat building sections, and display windows. Mounted signs inside the window or door are accurate, as are projected signs mounted into mortar that are located on the exterior facade at the first or second-floor level.
g.
Historic sign materials should be used. Plywood, plastic or unfinished wood, along with neon lights are not permitted.
h.
Signs should be of traditional design and color schemes, having no more than two or three colors that coordinate with the building facade. They should be compatible with signs on adjacent buildings in terms of size and scale and have lettering in serif, sans serif, or script styles that do not exceed 18 inches in height or 60 percent of the sign area. Like the other components of building restoration, the sign must be accurate for the architectural style and time period of the building. There should be no more than two signs per building (excluding display windows) and no more than one freestanding sign per building front. It is recommended that logos and symbols representative of the business are used since this adds to commercial recognition, and is a historic form of advertising.
i.
Floor, flashing, or internally-lit lighting, as well as lighting that is not easily visible from the pedestrian level, is not recommended. Incandescent spot or up-lit lighting visible from the street level is preferred.
