Article 6. - Use Provisions
Sec. 6.1. - Use Classification

6.1.1. - Classification of Uses
No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered or used, except for a use permitted in the district in which the building is located.
A.
Principal Uses
1.
In order to regulate a variety of similar uses, use categories have been established for principal uses. Use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning uses to appropriate categories with other, similar uses. Use categories classify principal uses and activities based on common functional, product or physical characteristics.
2.
Where a use category contains a list of included uses, the list is to be considered example uses, and not all-inclusive. The Zoning Administrator is responsible for categorizing uses as set out in Sec. 6.1.2.
3.
The allowed use table in Sec. 6.2. establishes permitted uses by district. No land shall be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located.
4.
Use category definitions are provided in Sec. 6.3. through Sec. 6.7.
B.
Accessory Uses
1.
An accessory use is any use that is subordinate in both purpose and size, incidental to and customarily associated with a permitted principal use located on the same lot.
2.
No accessory use or structure shall be located, constructed or moved upon a lot until the construction of the main building has commenced. No accessory structure shall be used unless the main building is in use.
3.
Standards for accessory uses are specified in Sec. 6.8.
C.
Temporary Uses
1.
A temporary use is a use that is in place for a limited period of time only.
2.
Requirements for temporary uses are specified in Sec. 6.9.
6.1.2. - Principal Uses Not Listed
A principal use not specifically listed is not allowed unless the Zoning Administrator determines the use to be part of a use category as described below.
A.
The Zoning Administrator is responsible for categorizing all principal uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the Zoning Administrator may consider the proposed use part of that use category. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the Zoning Administrator must consider the following criteria:
1.
The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use;
2.
The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use;
3.
Relative amounts of sales;
4.
The customer type;
5.
The relative number of employees;
6.
Hours of operation;
7.
Building and site arrangement;
8.
Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements;
9.
The number of vehicle trips generated;
10.
How the proposed use is advertised;
11.
The likely impact on surrounding properties; and
12.
Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.
B.
Where a use not listed is found by the Zoning Administrator not to be similar to any other permitted use, the use is only permitted following a text amendment.
