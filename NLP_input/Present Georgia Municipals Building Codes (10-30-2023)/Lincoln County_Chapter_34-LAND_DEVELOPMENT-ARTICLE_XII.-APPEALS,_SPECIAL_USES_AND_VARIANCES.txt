ARTICLE XII. - APPEALS, SPECIAL USES AND VARIANCES

Sec. 34-381. - Appeals.
The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decision or refusal made by the director or other administrative official in the administration or enforcement of any provisions of this chapter. Such appeals shall be in accordance with the following:
(1)
Appeals. An appeal to the planning commission may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any governmental officer, department, board or agency affected by any decision of the director or other administrative official with respect to this chapter. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days following notification of the decision appealed from, by filing with the planning commission, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The director shall forthwith transmit to the planning commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the action was taken.
(2)
Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all actions by the director seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the director certifies to the planning commission that a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3)
Evidence. The appellant and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present evidence on matters before the planning commission at the public hearing as required in section 34-384.
(4)
Power of planning commission. The planning commission, in conformity with this chapter, may modify in whole or in part any order, requirement or decision of the director and to that end shall have the power of the director or administrative official from whom the appeal is taken. The planning commission may direct the issuance of a permit. It shall be the duty of the director to carry out the decisions of the planning commission.
(Ord. No. 48, § 13-1, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-382. - Special uses.
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the planning commission. These uses are identified in this chapter as special uses and such uses may be allowed under special conditions. The granting of a special use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The special use may be forfeited if it does not meet the criteria provided in this section. Generally, a special use shall be compatible with the applicable zoning district under special conditions.
(1)
Special use approval. Special uses shall be permitted subject to an approval by the planning commission according to procedures established in section 34-384. The required review shall determine whether the uses conform to the standards set forth in subsection (2) of this section.
(2)
Special use standards. The special use shall be approved if it meets all the following factors:
a.
A rezoning to a more intensive zoning district, which contains that use as a use by right, would not be appropriate for the property.
b.
The location and character of the special use shall be compatible with the community development pattern and consistent with the needs of the neighborhood.
c.
The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the natural environment or of other property in the immediate vicinity, or diminish and impair property values within the surrounding neighborhood.
d.
The special use will not increase state or local expenditures in relation to the cost of servicing or maintaining neighborhood properties.
(3)
Additional conditions and development standards. The planning commission may impose any additional conditions and development standards, along with the grant of the special use, as may be necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of surrounding landowners, neighborhoods and workers. The planning commission may require as part of its approval, the following conditions:
a.
Planted or screen buffers to reduce adverse or potentially adverse effects on adjoining properties.
b.
Limitation of street accessways, parking areas and loading docks.
c.
The rearrangement of structures on the development site.
d.
Increases in maximum building height.
e.
Increases in the district requirements for lot size and building line setbacks, but not a reduction of these requirements.
f.
Limitations on the hours of business operation when it can be shown that proposed operational times would cause an adverse effect on adjoining, existing uses.
g.
Specified distances from existing residential, public, or institutional developments.
In no case, however, shall the planning commission exempt any special use from meeting the minimum lot and structure requirements of the zoning district in which the proposed use is to be located.
(Ord. No. 48, § 13-2, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-383. - Variances.
(a)
The planning commission shall hear and recommend to the board of commissioners applications for variances from the requirements of this chapter, but only in individual cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. This includes exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this chapter, was a lot or plat of record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the said development requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of such property. However, the planning commission shall not be authorized to recommend a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited.
(b)
No variance shall be recommended unless the planning commission finds that all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to the land involved and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity.
(2)
The strict application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship by depriving the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance from this chapter. There must be a deprivation of the beneficial use of land.
(3)
The condition from which relief of a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant.
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited in a given district by this chapter.
(c)
In reviewing an application for a variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be granted shall be upon the person applying thereof. Additional provisions are as follows:
(1)
Review and approval of request; conditions. The planning commission when making a recommendation on a variance request, or the board of commissioners when granting a variance, may establish reasonable conditions concerning the use of such property and may establish a time period for the variance so that the purpose of this chapter will be served and to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the zoning district in which such permit is granted.
(2)
Review and approval of request; guarantees. When necessary, the planning commission may recommend and the board of commissioners may require guarantees, in such form as it deems proper, to insure that conditions designated in connection therewith are being or will be complied with. Where any condition under which a request has been granted appears to have been violated, the planning commission may hold a public hearing thereon to determine whether or not the permit theretofore granted shall be terminated.
(3)
Subdivisions. The planning commission may recommend, and the board of commissioners may grant variances from the required improvements and minimum standards of design contained in sections 34-201—34-209 and 34-241—34-248; provided the subdivider makes a specific request and shows to the satisfaction of the planning commission and the board of commissioners that topographical or other conditions peculiar and particular to the site are such that strict adherence to the requirements would cause him unnecessary hardship and would not carry out the intent of this chapter.
(4)
Time limit for recommendation. The planning commission shall consider and decide whether to recommend approval or disapproval of a variance request within 45 days after the public hearing, as specified in section 34-384, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 34-382.
(5)
Recommendation recorded in minutes; termination of variance. The recommendation of approval or disapproval of a variance request by the planning commission, and the grant of a variance by the board of commissioners shall be stated in the minutes with the reasons for departure from the strict application of the ordinance and the conditions under which the variance was granted. Any variance granted shall terminate automatically when the use ceases to be in full compliance with any conditions imposed by the board of commissioners, when the use has been abandoned or when the building permit shall have expired.
(Ord. No. 48, § 13-3, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-384. - Public hearings.
After receiving an application for an appeal, variance or special use, the planning commission shall schedule a public hearing.
(1)
Application. The application and fee determined by the county for a hearing and decision on requests for an appeal, variance or special use shall be filed with the director on forms provided by the county at least 30 days prior to the next scheduled planning commission meeting. Each application shall contain such information as the director may require to enable the planning commission to make its decision on an appeal or special use, or a recommendation on a variance request.
(2)
Notice of hearing. The planning commission shall publish once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, a written notice of such public hearing at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice shall indicate the time, place and nature of the appeal, variance or special use to be considered by the planning commission. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney. The cost of such newspaper notice shall be paid by the applicant.
Additionally, at least 15 days before the scheduled public hearing, the director shall post, in a conspicuous place on the property a sign at least two feet by three feet in size. It shall set forth the time, place and purpose of the public hearing before the planning commission. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of notice by a sign posted on the property shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken under this article.
(Ord. No. 48, § 13-4, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-385. - Appeal of the planning commission action.
Any person, jointly or separately, aggrieved by any decision of the planning commission may appeal to the superior court of the county in conformance with section 34-430.
(Ord. No. 48, § 13-5, 1-9-2003)
