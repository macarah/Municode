Provided, however, that the city reserves the right to reject all bids. In the event all bids exceed available funds as certified by the city treasurer, and the low responsive bid does not exceed such funds by more than five (5) percent, the purchasing agent is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the low responsible and responsive bidder in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.

(2)
Determination of nonresponsibility: If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to supply prompt information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility. A copy of the determination shall be sent to the nonresponsible bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made a public record.

(2)
Amount of bid security: Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five (5) percent of the amount of the bid. Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of the bid security. Upon failure of a successful bidder to enter into a contract within ten (10) days after the purchasing agent tenders the proposed contract, the bidder shall forfeit the bid security.

(2)
Reduction or waiver of bond: The purchasing agent is authorized to reduce or waive performance and payment bonds for contracts for equipment, supplies and services for one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or less, when the purchasing agent makes a written determination that it is in the best interests of the city to do so. Nothing herein prevents the requirement of such bonds on supply or service contracts under one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) when the circumstances warrant. The purchasing agent is authorized to reduce or waive payment bonds on contracts for professional or consultant services when the purchasing agent determines it is in the best interests of the city.
(3)
Authority to require additional bonds: Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require a performance or payment bond or other security in addition to those bonds, or in circumstances other than those specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
(4)
Suits on payment bonds right to institute: Any person who has furnished labor or material to the contractor for the work provided in the contract, for which a payment bond is furnished under this section, and who had not been paid in full within ninety (90) days from the date on which that person performed the last of the labor or supplied the material, shall have the right to sue on the payment bond for any amount unpaid at the time the suit is instituted and to prosecute the action for the amount due that person.
(5)
Suits on payment bonds where and when brought: Every suit instituted upon a payment bond shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for the county or district in which the contract for equipment, supplies, services, construction, and professional or consultant services was to be performed; but no such suit shall be commenced after the expiration of one (1) year after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied by the person bringing suit.
