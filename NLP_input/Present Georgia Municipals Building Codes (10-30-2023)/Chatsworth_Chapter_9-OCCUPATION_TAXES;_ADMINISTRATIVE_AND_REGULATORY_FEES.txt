ARTICLE XII. - GOING-OUT-OF-BUSINESS SALES

Sec. 9-160. - Purpose and intent.
The city finds and declares that the provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter are necessary to further significant city interests in that:
(a)
Prolonged liquidation or "going out of business" sales could tend to create, or leave the impression of, blighted or economically depressed conditions in and around the location of the sale; and
(b)
Liquidation or forced sales are frequently characterized by large banners or signs which can result in visual blight, and the presence of a large number of persons which can result in traffic congestion, noise, and litter.

The city's public officer or designee will regulate, license, and monitor this form of business to protect consumers from misleading or fraudulent practices. The law prohibits conducting a going-out-of-business sale for more than 90 days. After this time limit has expired, it is against the law to do business in any other manner contrary to representations that were made about the nature of the sale.
