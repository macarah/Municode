Sec. 90-306. - Installation details.
(a)
All work in connection with the pole line, cable, pipeline, facility or operations authorized by the permit shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner and the details of such construction work shall conform as a minimum to the established rules and regulations of the public service commission of the state now in effect or which may hereafter be put into effect by said commission, and the pertinent provisions of the established policy and procedures of the department of transportation of the state for accommodations of utilities.
(b)
All utility installations shall conform with the applicable sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation's standard specifications; the National Electrical Safety Code; the American Water Works Association Standards; or the recognized standard code for the type of facility to be installed.
(c)
No trench shall be excavated with a top width of 18 inches more than the outside diameter of the pipe, conduit, casing or cable to be installed unless permission is first obtained from the county engineer. The ditch shall be cut as narrow as practicable to minimize the amount of material to be removed and recompacted.
(d)
The back filling of all trenches and tunnels shall be accomplished immediately after the facility authorized by the permit has been placed therein and within the ditch lines (including the traveled portion of the road, the shoulders and the front or inside ditch slopes), shall be well tamped and fully compacted in order to allow the least possible amount of subsequent settlement.
(e)
All debris, refuse and waste of all kinds which may have accumulated upon the road right-of-way by reason of the operations of the applicant shall be removed immediately upon completion of such operations and the road right-of-way shall be restored by the applicant, including grass, to at least as good a physical condition as it was immediately preceding such operations or construction.
(f)
No open cuts will be permitted except by special permission of the county engineer. In no event will an open cut of the paved or surfaced portion of a road be allowed when it is reasonably practical to bore or tunnel under the surface of the road. Whenever the county engineer is requested to authorize an open cut, such request must be made in writing supported by detailed reasons why some other method is not practical. When tunneling or boring under a roadway, the diameter of the hole shall exceed the outside of the diameter of the pipe, conduit, casing or cable to be placed therein no more than is reasonably necessary and practicable to make such installation. Cement grout shall be pumped around all pipe, conduits, casings or cables where required to fill voids which developed during the installation operation. Trenching, boring or tunneling shall not be closer to any edge of the surfaced portion of the road than specified in the permit.
(g)
Upon special permission being granted by county engineer for open cutting of the paved or surfaced portion of the road, the following provisions shall be strictly adhered to:
(1)
The trenched edges in paved areas shall be sawed or cut to neat lines by methods satisfactory to the county engineer before starting to break the pavement slab.
(2)
In trenching across the road not more than one-half of the paved surface is to be opened at one time. The opened half shall be either the right half or the left half of the paved surface and shall be completely filled before opening the other half.
(3)
Immediately after the facility authorized by the permit has been installed in the trench, the trench shall be back filled and compacted in accordance with the plans and specifications for same which have been authorized by the county engineer.
(4)
The paved surface shall then be patched in accordance with the plans and specifications as authorized by the county engineer.
(5)
For a period of one year following the patching of the paved surface the applicant shall be responsible for the pavement and shoulder patches and during that time, upon request from the county engineer, repaired to the county engineer's satisfaction any of the said patches which become settled, cracked, broken or otherwise faulty. Additionally, the period of time for which applicant is responsible for the pavement and shoulder patches shall automatically be extended by one additional year.
(h)
Closure of intersecting streets, road approaches or other access points will not be permitted and upon trenching across same the applicant shall utilize steel running plates, planks or other satisfactory methods for traffic engineering or leaving the road or adjacent properties. Immediately after the facility authorized by the permit has been installed, the intersecting street, road approaches or other access facility shall be restored to at least as good a physical condition as it was prior to the permitted operations in a manner satisfactory to the county engineer.
(i)
It is strictly forbidden to spray with selective herbicides or to cut or trim trees or shrubs growing on the road right-of-way unless and until written permission therefor has first been obtained from the county engineer; provided, however, that emergency repairs may be made as herein provided including the cutting and trimming of trees and shrubs.
(Ord. No. 98-01, 4-13-98)
Sec. 90-307. - Location of utility facilities.
(a)
All pole lines, cables, pipelines, miscellaneous facilities or operations shall be located so as to minimize the need for later adjustment to accommodate future road improvements and to permit access for servicing such facilities with minimum interference to roadway traffic.
(b)
Longitudinal installations are to be located on uniform alignments as near as practicable to the right-of-way line so as to provide a safe environment for traffic operation, facilitate road and right-of-way maintenance and preserve space for future road improvements or other utility installations and such installation be made within the outer two feet of right-of-way unless the location of the installation is deemed impractical by the county engineer and permission for location elsewhere is granted by the county engineer.
(c)
To the extent feasible and practical, utility line crossings of the road shall cross on a line generally normal to the roadway alignment. Oblique roadway crossings have several objections and should be avoided wherever practical; provided, however, that when any alignment is deemed impractical by the county engineer he/she may approve applications containing such alignment as he/she deems appropriate under the existing conditions.
(d)
The horizontal and vertical location of all utility facilities within the road right-of-way limits shall conform with the policies applicable for the particular type of road and the specific engineering conditions and designs as may from time to time be promulgated by the county engineer and approved by the board of commissioners for that type of road or for the particular roadway section involved. Above ground utility facilities are a form of road side obstacles and their location must be consistent with the clearances applicable to all road side obstacles involved.
(Ord. No. 98-01, 4-13-98)
Sec. 90-308. - Designs of utility facilities.
(a)
Except where a high degree of protection is required by county policies or regulations, by industry or governmental codes or by laws or orders of the public authority having jurisdiction over the utility, all utility installations on, over, under or across the right-of-way of a road and utility attachments to highway structures shall, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:
(1)
Power lines and cables and all electric power and communications facilities shall conform with the applicable sections of the current edition of the National Electric Safety Code of the United State Department of Commerce National Bureau of Standards and shall hereafter conform with the applicable provisions of each subsequent edition of said code. The minimum vertical clearance shall be the clearance as specified in said code now in effect or which may hereafter be put into effect. Joint use of poles, structures and other facilities may be desirable because of existing conditions at the location of same, and each applicant is requested to cooperate and work with other utility suppliers in planning such joint use.
(2)
Water lines are to conform with the specifications of the American Water Works Association.
(3)
Pressure pipelines are to conform with the current applicable section ANSI standard code for pressure piping of the American National Standards Institute and applicable industry codes.
(4)
Controls for installing underground pipelines on any road right-of-way shall be as follows:
a.
The grade of the top of any pipe within the road right-of-way shall be established to provide minimum burying as follows: Under pavement surface, four feet; under other surfaces, including underlying ditches, three feet; and, under a sidewalk, paved ditch or ditch gutter, two feet.
b.
For flexible pipe under pavement, minimum bury shall be four feet or the outside diameter of the pipe, whichever is greater.
c.
Where less than the minimum bury, as hereinbefore set out, is necessary to conform to existing conditions or other planned work or is essential to avoid rock excavation, the laying of pipelines below the permanent water table or other physical conflicts, the top of the pipe must not project into the pavement sub-base and when required by the county engineer shall be protected with an acceptable casing or capping.
d.
The design for the installation, location, alignment, burying, encasement and attachment to roadway structures of pole lines, cables and pipelines and all appurtenances thereto, including vents, drains, markers, manholes and shut-offs shall be the same as provided by the Georgia Department of Transportation in its policy and procedure for accommodation of utilities unless waived or otherwise specified by the county engineer.
