(c)
Sailplane operations will not be conducted when the ceiling is less than 1,500 feet AGL and/or the prevailing visibility is less than three statue miles, as reported by the AWOS system installed at the airport. If the AWOS system is not available, a pilot report from the local area may be used.
(d)
Sailplane operations shall normally be launched and recovered on the runway.
(e)
Sailplanes will be allowed to utilize the grass immediately adjacent and parallel to the northern (Runway 21) portion of the runway only. No sailplanes may use the grass area adjacent to the southern (Runway 3) end of the runway for landing because of the locations of the PAPI landing aid next to the runway at that end.
(f)
A maximum of two ground vehicles may be used to move sailplanes to and from the sailplane launch and recovery areas, all in accordance with these rules and regulations. Drivers of such vehicles shall be equipped with a radio capable of transmissions on the CTAF frequency and the driver will monitor this frequency. Drivers shall not cross any runway or taxiway until they are assured that no interference exists with any airborne traffic on, to, or from the runway, taxiways or operational areas. The drivers must hold a valid driver's license.
(g)

When on the runway or other area for launching or recovery, pre-and post-flight activities must be kept to a minimum (but safety must not be compromised) so as to keep the runway, taxiways, and launch/recovery areas as clear as possible for other traffic.
(j)
All staging, takeoff and recovery activities must not, when safely possible, exceed five minutes total time, or such activities for that operation will immediately cease and the runway, taxiways, and runway and taxiway object free areas will be cleared of sailplanes, towplanes and persons. However, this time limit shall not include holding delays for coordination with powered traffic.
(k)
All sailplane and towplane pilots, as well as the required ground crew entering the runway and taxiway object free areas for staging, takeoff and recovery activities must have operable communication radios, turned on and tuned to the airport CTAF frequency.

Sec. 14-61. - Parachute jumping.
(a)
Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 105 prescribes rules governing parachute jumps made in the United States, except parachute jumps necessary because of an in-flight emergency. Operating rules and parachute equipment are designated in FAR Part 105. All parachute operations at the Monroe-Walton County Airport will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 105, except in cases where state or local laws or ordinances impose more stringent requirements. Therefore, in no manner do the rules and regulations of the Monroe-Walton County Airport relieve any responsibility imposed by Federal Aviation Regulations or any state or local laws. FAR Part 105 is included as an appendix to Ordinance No. 2000-01, the ordinance from which this chapter derives. All parachute operations shall meet or exceed the basic safety regulations (BSR) established by the United States Parachute Association and related FAA Advisory Circulars.
(b)
No person may make a parachute jump, and no pilot in command of an aircraft may allow a parachute jump to be made from that aircraft, if that jump creates a hazard to air traffic or to persons or property on the surface.
(c)
The FAA has defined "parachute jumping" as an aeronautical use. Consequently, requests of clubs, organizations, and individuals to establish a drop zone within the boundaries or reservation of the Airport shall be evaluated by the airport manager on the same basis as other aeronautical uses of the airport.
(d)
The airport manager is not required to permit or allow any request to establish a drop zone for parachute jumping onto the airport. However, the airport manager shall exercise his judgment or discretion in determining whether to permit, allow or disallow such request based on information contained in the application to establish a drop zone or conduct parachute jumping activities within the boundaries of the airport and considering safety to applicants and the public making other use of the airport and the FAR's and advisory circulars or other FAA guidance at the time and date of request and at the time of the proposed activity.
(e)
The airport manager shall require written application from any person, club or organization requesting a permit to establish a drop zone or to conduct parachute jumping activities at the airport. The form shall be as prescribed by the airport manager, but shall contain the following:

Time and date jumping activities are to be carried out.

The policy or certificate of insurance shall be on file with the airport manager prior to commencement of the parachute jumping activity.
(g)
The airport manager shall require any person engaging or participating in any manner in the parachute jumping activity to execute a personal waiver and release of liability in favor of the city, their respective officers, agents, attorneys and employees.
(h)
The airport manager is authorized to promulgate rules and issue such other requirements for establishment of a drop zone or conduct of parachute jumping activities within the boundary of the airport as are not inconsistent with the provisions of these rules and regulations, the Federal Aviation Act, and applicable FARs promulgated pursuant thereto.
(i)
When parachute jumping activity is approved by the airport manager, the following minimum requirements shall apply:
(1)
No jumper will exit an aircraft after having consumed any alcoholic beverage or taken any illegal drug or any substance that would affect his/her faculties in any way contrary to safety.
(2)
The location of the jump zone shall be approved by the airport manager prior to commencement of the parachute jumping activity. The jump zone shall remain outside of the runway and taxiway object free areas.
(3)
The drop zone operator shall be in charge of, and responsible for, all jumping activities. The drop zone operator shall be appropriately certified by the United States Parachuting Association (USPA).
(4)

a.
The registration number and type of jump aircraft.
b.
The name, current address, telephone number and pilot certificate number of the pilot in command of the jump aircraft.

(5)
Any aircraft or pilot that does not conform to all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations shall not be used in the conduct of jumping activities. No parachute jumping activity shall take place in an aircraft not properly certified for airworthiness.
(j)
Two-way radio communication on the Monroe Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) must be established and maintained during all jumping activities by the drop zone operator and the pilot in command of the aircraft used in the parachute jumping activity. The pilot in command of the aircraft used in the parachute jumping activity shall give notice on the Monroe CTAF two minutes prior to each jump and shall announce "jumpers away" at the time any parachute jumper exits the aircraft. In the event that radio communication is lost prior to the jump, no jumpers may drop onto the airport.
(k)
The drop zone operator and pilot in command of the aircraft used in the parachute jumping activity shall be responsible, jointly and severally, to comply with the provisions of FAR Part 105.
(l)
Aircraft taking off or landing at the airport shall have the right-of-way over all parachute jumping activities or parachutists on board except in the event of an emergency.

It shall be the responsibility of the drop zone operator to ensure that all rules and regulations of the USPA and the airport are complied with throughout the parachute jumping activity.
(n)
All parachute jumping activity permitted by the airport manager shall be conducted within the conditions and limitations set forth by the airport manager in the written permit to the person, club, or organization requesting to establish the drop zone or conduct parachute jumping activities.
(o)
The decision of the airport manager to allow, permit, or disallow an application to establish a drop zone or to conduct parachute jumping activities shall be final and constitute the decision of the city. There shall be no appeal through the city of the decision of the airport manager in this regard.
