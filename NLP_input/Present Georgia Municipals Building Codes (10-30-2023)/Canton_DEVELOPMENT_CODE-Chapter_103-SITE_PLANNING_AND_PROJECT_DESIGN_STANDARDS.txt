Chapter 103 - SITE PLANNING AND PROJECT DESIGN STANDARDS

103.01.00 - Generally.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide design standards applicable to all development activity within the City of Canton. This chapter expands upon the zone standards of chapter 102 by addressing additional details of site planning, project design, and the operation of land uses. These standards are intended to ensure that proposed development is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of desirable character, consistent with the comprehensive plan and any applicable specific plan.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)
103.02.00 - Standards for all development and land uses.
103.02.01 - Design standards for lots, residential development.
A.
One principal building on a lot. Only one principal building and its customary accessory building or buildings may be erected on any one lot. This pertains to single-family detached zoning districts.
B.
Residential corner lots.
1)
The minimum front yard requirement may be reduced to one-half the regulated distance on the portion of the lot fronting on the street or streets having the lower functional classification. However, in no case shall the setback be reduced to less than 15 feet. The minimum front yard for the portion of the lot fronting on the street having the higher functional classification shall be provided in accordance with the provisions established by this UDC for the district in which the lot is located.
2)
For purposes of establishing the front yard, such yard shall be designated as that abutting the street having the lower functional classification. Where the classification is the same for both streets, the front yard shall be designated as that having the shortest frontage on the street.
C.
Double frontage lots.
1)
On lots having frontage on two streets, but not located on a corner, the minimum front yard shall be provided on each street in accordance with the provisions of this UDC.
2)
On lots having frontage on more than two streets, the minimum front yard shall be provided in accordance with the regulations set forth in this UDC on at least two of the street frontages. The minimum front yard on the other frontage or frontages may be reduced along the other streets in accordance with the provisions of section 103.03.01.B (Residential corner lots).
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)

103.05.00 - Signs.
103.05.01 - Signs, purpose and intent.
A.
Purpose.
1)
The city council finds that the natural surroundings, history, and people of the City of Canton combine to provide the Canton community with unique charm and beauty. The signs section has been adopted to assure that signs installed in the City of Canton are compatible with the unique character and environment of the community.
2)
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. Left unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of the City of Canton as an aesthetic nuisance. Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including:
a.
"The Public Purpose of Roswell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper" (December 7, 1999) by Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP; and
b.
"Safety Impacts of the Emerging Digital Display Technologies for Outdoor Advertising Signs" (April 2009) by Jerry Wachtel for AASHTO and the Standing Committee on Research of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP).
3)
In particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the city finds that unregulated signs:
a.
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
b.
Can distract drivers;
c.
Can create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the city;
d.
Can hamper economic growth;
e.
Can lower property values;
f.
Can adversely impact public investments;
g.
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
h.
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.
4)
The purpose of this Code section is to promote the public health, safety and welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content-neutral, and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. It is further determined that the provisions of this section cannot achieve the end result desired unless the community voluntarily cooperates in upholding these provisions.
5)
Bearing in mind the concepts presented above, the purpose of this section is to:
a.
Preserve and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Canton.
b.
To promote and accomplish the goals, policies and objectives of the City of Canton Comprehensive Plan.
c.
To balance public and private objectives by allowing adequate signage for business identification.
d.
To promote the free flow of traffic and protect pedestrians and motorists from injury and property damage caused by, or which may be fully or partially attributable to cluttered, distracting, and/or illegible signage.
e.
To prevent property damage and personal injury from signs which are improperly constructed or poorly maintained.
f.
To promote the use of signs which are aesthetically pleasing, of appropriate scale, and integrated with surrounding buildings and landscape, in order to meet the community's expressed desire for quality development.
g.
To protect property values, the local economy, and the quality of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape which affects the image of the City of Canton.
B.
Intent. It is the intent of this section to:
1)
Provide functional flexibility, encourage variety and create an incentive to relate signage to basic principles of good design.
2)
Assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets, and other public structures and spaces, are protected by exercising reasonable controls over the character and design of sign structures.
3)
Provide an improved visual environment for the citizens of, and visitors to, the City of Canton, and to protect view sheds within the community.

1)
To adequately protect the site, tree save areas shall be delineated in the field with tree protection measures.
2)
The director shall review and approve the installation of tree protection measures on the site prior to any land disturbance activity.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)
103.06.04 - Implementation procedures.
A.
Generally. An approved tree protection/landscape plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
B.
Inspections. In addition to unscheduled inspections conducted by the director during construction to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan, the following inspection process shall apply:
1)
When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvement, he/she shall request an inspection by the director.
2)
If the director approves the installation, the two-year maintenance bond shall be submitted.
3)
If the director does not approve the landscape implementation, he/she shall submit a report stating his/her reasons for disapproval so that the developer may make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a reinspection shall be requested.
C.
Bond release. At 45 days prior to the expiration of the two-year landscape maintenance period, the director shall inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such finding, the bond shall be released at the two-year expiration date. In absence of such finding, the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the director. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the director decision regarding such trees, the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance. The final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days' notice.
D.
Maintenance. Trees, which are used to meet the density requirements, shall be fully maintained after the date of final landscape establishment inspection by the property owner. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this section. Trees which have been used to meet the tree density requirements shall not be removed at any time without approval of the director. Removal of such trees shall result in replacement of like kind and size by the property owner.
E.
Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the director to enforce the provisions and requirements of this section. The director shall conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this section.

(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)
103.06.05 - Tree protection standards.
A.
Generally.
1)
Existing trees shall not be disturbed, except as outlined in this UDC.
2)
No person shall cut, carve or otherwise damage any tree.
3)
No person shall attach rope, wire, nails, or advertising posters to any tree.
4)
No person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heart thereof will injure any portion of any tree.
5)
Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see section 103.06.07, specimen trees).
6)
It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to:
a.
Alteration of building design;
b.
Alternate building location, parking area, detention area, or drainage system; or
c.
Relocation of utilities.
7)
Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process.
8)
The guidelines and standards in sections 103.06.05.B and 103.06.05.C shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the site density factor on a property.
9)
For the purpose of section 103.06.00, caliper measurements for all trees shall be at diameter breast height (DBH).
B.
Site planning. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection through the site development process. Disturbance within the critical root zone (CRZ) can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these CRZs the following planning considerations should be applied:
1)
The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection.
2)
Tree protection and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention can be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills. Tree wells and/or aeration systems can also be provided for trees in areas of fill.
3)
Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones.
4)
Construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burn hole placement, silt fence installation, etc. shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones.
C.
Methods of tree protection. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of CRZ loss. To protect these CRZs, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to:
1)
Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials;
2)
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching;
3)
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment;
4)
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc.
D.
Methods of preventing encroachment. The following describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines shall be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction.
1)
Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the community development director. Barriers will be a minimum four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch-by-four-inch post and a one-inch-by-four-inch rail, with the posts no further than six feet apart, are recommended. Chain-link fence with the same post spacing is also acceptable. All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibility on all sides of the fenced in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete.
2)
Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their CRZs which are located 61 feet or greater from any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four-foot orange laminated plastic safety fencing. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity.
3)
Boring. No open trenching shall be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Any exceptions must be approved by the community development director. Utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a 24-inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method.
4)
Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation.
5)
Soil compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or material storage, the tree protection zone must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch, or a six-inch layer of pine straw.
6)
Clearing activities. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g. with a ditch witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees.
7)
Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation. All roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extends outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)

Plan should indicate staging areas for parking, materials storage, concrete washout, silt fence installation and debris burn where these areas might affect tree protection.
n.
The required site tree density factor must be satisfied. Compliance shall be clearly demonstrated on the tree protection plan. Existing trees or stands of trees used in the density calculation must be clearly indicated on the drawing. A summary table of the number of existing trees to remain and new trees to be planted, by diameter shall be shown along with the calculations showing tree density achieved for the site.
o.
Additional information as required on a case by case basis. This could include, but is not limited to, a certified arborist's appraisal of the tree's viability and projected life span.
p.
The following notes shall be indicated on both the tree protection plan and the grading plan in large bold letters:
"ALL TREE PROTECTION MEASURES SHALL BE INSTALLED AND INSPECTED PRIOR TO THE START OF ANY LAND DISTURBANCE AND MAINTAINED UNTIL FINAL LANDSCAPING IS INSTALLED. CALL THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FOR AN INSPECTION BY THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR OR HIS/HER DESIGNEE.
NO PARKING, STORAGE, OR ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE TO OCCUR WITHIN TREE PROTECTION AREAS.
A MAINTENANCE INSPECTION OF TREES WILL BE PERFORMED AFTER TWO FULL GROWING SEASONS FROM THE DATE OF THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION/FIRST CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY INSPECTION. PROJECT OWNERS AT THE TIME OF THE MAINTENANCE INSPECTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDINANCE COMPLIANCE."
B.
Determination of site density factor. The minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce a total site density factor (SDF) of 20 units per acre.
1)
All projects within the city shall maintain or exceed a minimum site density factor of 20 units per acre. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development.
2)
Minimum tree site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this section.
3)
The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree."
4)
Existing trees proposed to be retained and new trees proposed to be planted in order to meet the buffer requirements of section 103.03.00 or the conditions of zoning/master plan or variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this section concerning site tree density factors.
a.
Buffer requirements are considered to be in addition to the minimum site tree density requirements.
b.
See applicable zoning/master plan or variance conditions for any additional landscaping or buffering requirements.
5)
The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this section, or some combination of the two. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried.
6)
The trees, both retained and new, where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards.
7)
Trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have four-foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones. For methods of tree protection, see section 103.06.05. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed.
8)
Minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in replanting.
9)
The site density factor (SDF) is determined as follows: SDF = (total site area, in acres) × 20
C.
Credit for existing trees. Credit for existing trees proposed to be retained on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in table 103-9, credit for existing trees.
1)
Credit shall be given for all trees retained on a property having a diameter of five inches DBH or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer and/or state waters' buffers.
2)
Only 50 percent of tree credits may be calculated from areas located in the floodplain or delineated as wetlands. No existing tree shall be counted as credit towards site density if greater than ten percent of its CRZ is disturbed.
3)
Using table 103-9 calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees five inches DBH or greater which will remain on the site and be protected during construction.
4)
The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the site density factor on a property:
a.
Canopy/shade replacement trees shall be at least ten feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. Multi-stemmed canopy trees shall count only the largest trunk for caliper.
b.
Understory/flowering replacement trees shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a main trunk of not less than two caliper inches. All multi-stemmed understory/flowering replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet.
c.
Evergreen replacement trees shall be at least a seven-gallon size, six feet tall planted, and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. All tree-formed, multi-stemmed, evergreen replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet and be pruned as tree form at time of planting.
d.
No more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan.

Establishing the replacement density factor (RDF). To calculate the replacement density factor (RDF), subtract the existing density factor (EDF) from the site density factor (SDF).
E.
RDF = SDF — EDF
1)
Example procedures for calculating the required replacement density factor (RDF):
→
Step 1—Calculate the site density factor (SDF) by multiplying the number of site acres by 20.
Example = 1.85 acres X 20 = 37.0 Units
→
Step 2—Calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees that will remain on site to be protected during construction. EDF is determined by converting the tree diameter (DBH) of individual existing trees to density factor units, using table 103-9. These units are then totaled to determine the EDF for the site.
Example = A total of 12 trees will remain on the 1.85 acre site in step 1. The trees include:
•
Three 12-inch pines.
•
Four 18-inch oaks.
•
Three 20-inch pines.
•
Two 24-inch oaks.
When converted to density factor units using table 103-9, we arrive at the following values:
EXPAND
DBH Number of Trees X Units Total
12" 3 X 1.2 3.6
18" 4 X 2.1 8.4
20" 3 X 2.4 7.2
24" 2 X 3.3 6.6
  Adding together the units of all remaining trees, the sum total of units = 25.8
Since the existing density factor (EDF) is less than the required site density factor (SDF), replacement trees are required. The minimum site density factor (SDF) for a 1.85-acre site, established in step 1 has not yet been met.
→
Step 3—Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF) by subtracting the existing density factor (EDF) (step 2) from the site density factor (SDF) (step 1). RDF = EDF — SDF
Example = RDF = 37.0 (SDF) — 25.8 (EDF) = 11.2 (RDF)
Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter or height) times the units assigned in table 103-10, credit for replacement trees. Credit shall be given all new trees replaced on the property except for new trees of less than one and one-half inches in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer and/or state waters' buffers. The number of new trees planted is determined as follows:
→
Step 4—The replacement density factor (RDF) can be converted back to caliper inches using table 103-10. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the replacement density factor (RDF).
Example = On the 1.85-acre site the following number and size of trees will be planted as replacement trees:
EXPAND
Number Size Species X Density Factor = Total Units
8 5" Dogwood X 0.3 = 2.4
6 10" Red Maple X 0.9 = 5.4
2 15" Red Oak X 1.8 = 3.6
  Adding together the units of proposed replacement trees, the sum total of units = 11.4 units.
Proposed replacement units of 11.4 is greater than the replacement density factor (RDF) of 11.2 units; thus, minimum replacement requirements have been met and in this case, exceeded.

103.06.07 - Specimen trees.
A.
Generally. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Design of buildings, hardscape and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees.
B.
Criteria. The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. These criteria must be met for a tree to qualify:
1)
Size.
a.
Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweet gums, etc.), 26-inch DBH or larger.
b.
Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.), 30-inch DBH or larger.
c.
Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.), eight-inch DBH or larger.
2)
Other. A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if, in the judgment of the director it is:
a.
A rare or unusual species or of historical significance.
b.
Specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape.
c.
A tree with exceptional aesthetic quality.
C.
Additional density credit. In order to encourage the protection of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit may be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose.
1)
Such design features shall include, but may not be limited to alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities.
2)
Credit for any specimen tree thus saved for such purpose would be two times the assigned unit value in table 103-9, credit for existing trees. Applicable credit must be approved by the director.
D.
Replacement, generally. Specimen tree replacement, in addition to minimum required tree density, shall be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees.
1)
Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality.
2)
Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees a minimum three-inch caliper at 14-foot minimum height, with an inch-for-inch replacement of the specimen tree removed.
E.
Replacement due to damage. Any tree designated on the tree protection plan to be saved which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the director, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equaling an inch-for-inch replacement of the tree damaged.
F.
Replacement due to improper removal. Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the director must be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch-for-inch replacement of the tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be three-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the director.
G.
Replacement as required maintenance. In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 24 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) having an inch-for-inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the director. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this section and may result in replanting.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 2, 8-21-2014)
103.06.08 - Removal of trees.
A.
Permit required. A tree removal permit shall be required for removing trees, five-inch DBH or greater. Permit applications shall be submitted to the community development department or in conjunction with an application for a land disturbance permit and/or building permit, whichever is applicable as determined by the director.
B.
Fees.
1)
There will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of trees to be removed from all commercial, office, and industrial zoned properties and all residential zoned properties having greater than one acre land disturbance.
2)
The fee will be established by city council resolution.
3)
Homeowners on those properties with less than one acre land disturbance who remove trees on their own residential property, shall not pay any fee but are required to obtain a tree removal permit.
4)
If any tree five-inch DBH or greater is removed from those properties requiring a tree removal permit as listed above without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated.
5)
Tree removal plans submitted in conjunction with an application for a land disturbance permit and/or building permit will not be required to pay an additional tree removal permit outside the fees required for the land disturbance permit and/or building permit.
C.
Review and inspections. The director will review the tree removal plans and inspect the project site when necessary prior to the removal of any trees.
D.
Tree removal standards.
1)
Safety standards. The contractor shall be solely responsible for pedestrian and vehicular safety and control within the work site and shall provide the necessary warning devices, barricades, and ground personnel needed to give safety, protection, and warning within the area where tree removal or pruning is to occur.

103.06.09 - Maintenance requirements.
A.
Release of bond. At 45 days prior to the expiration of the two-year landscape maintenance period, the Director shall inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such finding, the bond shall be released at the two-year expiration date. In absence of such finding, the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the director. Any trees planted to meet the required tree site density factor which are dead or near death must be replaced.
B.
Failure to comply. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the director's decision regarding trees' health at the end of the two-year landscape establishment period, the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance. Final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days' notice.
C.
Additional requirements.
1)
Trees which are used to meet the tree density requirements shall be fully maintained for an additional two years after the date of final landscape establishment inspection. It is the responsibility of the property owner to water, fertilize, and treat trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. The property owner shall, at all times, maintain the required tree density. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this section.
2)
It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject to this section to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Planting beds shall be mulched to prevent weed growth and maintain soil moisture.
