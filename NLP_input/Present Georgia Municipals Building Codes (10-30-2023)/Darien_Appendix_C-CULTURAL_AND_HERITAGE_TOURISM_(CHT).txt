The purpose of a CCC is to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth in this section. A CCC application shall include a site plan, building floor plans, and elevations, drawn to scale, and shall be approved by the city manager, or designee.
A CCC is also required for the following in keeping with other requirements of the Cultural And Heritage Tourism District: Open Space development and maintenance agreements, paving in parking areas other than asphalt and concrete, reduction of parking requirements, off-site parking, shared parking, angled on-street parking, curb cuts, new streets,Sidewalk Area improvements including special or decorative paving and plantings and street furniture location and type, and Street Wall requirements.
Existing buildings and building facades are grandfathered in, until such time as changes are made to elements that are cited in this section.

For the purposes of protecting an existing mature shade tree, an applicant may request an administrative variation from regulations, subject to CCC requirements and conditioned to a site plan which demonstrates that provisions shall be made to implement an alternate design which meets the intent of the Cultural And Heritage Tourism District.
A CCC applicant shall receive a response from the city within 15 days of the date that a completed application is submitted. The application fee shall be in accordance with the City of Darien's fee schedule then in effect.
