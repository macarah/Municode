DIVISION 1. - CRITERIA FOR WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS

Sec. 7.5-26. - Finding of fact and purpose; protection of water supply watersheds.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Toccoa and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediments into drinking water supplies, making treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste material result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
The purpose of this division is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the City of Toccoa; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This division shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the City of Toccoa.

DIVISION 2. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 7.5-41. - Finding of fact and purpose.
The wetlands in the City of Toccoa are indispensable and fragile resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
The purpose of this division is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 6, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-42. - Definitions.
[Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application.]
Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
Generalized wetland map is the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for Toccoa, Georgia. (figure 4.2: Environmentally Sensitive Water Resource Areas Map from the Toccoa-Stephens County Comprehensive Plan)
Jurisdictional wetland is an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination is a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C., 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity is any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 7, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-43. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Toccoa, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps (Figure 4.2: Environmentally Sensitive Water Resource Areas of the Toccoa —Stephens County Comprehensive Plan). This map shall be referred to as the Generalized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this division, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
The Generalized Wetlands Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Toccoa and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 8, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-44. - Protection criteria.
Requirement of local permit or permission: No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written permission or a permit from the City of Toccoa. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the designated inspector of the City of Toccoa, using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 9, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-45. - Permitted Uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with Best Management Practices (BMPs) approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to Best Management Practices (BMPs) approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved Best Management Practices (BMPs) are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 10, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-46. - Prohibited uses.
The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants;
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
(Ord. No. O-13-01, § 11, 8-13-01)
Sec. 7.5-47. - Administration, enforcement, penalties, variances, and appeals.
The administration and enforcement of these regulations, as well as all penalties, variances and appeals shall follow the procedures identified and outlined in the City of Toccoa Code of Ordinances, Chapter 24, Zoning, Articles VI and VII.
The City of Toccoa (acknowledging Section 404 of the Clean Water Act) does not have the authority to allow appeals or grant variances for proposed development within or adjacent to wetlands, as identified on the generalized wetlands map. No local permit for any proposed development activity occurring within a wetland shall be granted until a section 404 permit, or letter of permission, or determination, is issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Sec. 7.5-64. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 7.5-64(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsection 7.5-64(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 7.5-64(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 8-2004, § III, 5-24-04)
Sec. 7.5-65. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General.

They shall review the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Toccoa without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority to perform such activity.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 7.5-65(c). Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 7.5-64(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
(3)
A fee, in the amount of $25.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
(4)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(5)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 7.5-64(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection 7.5-65(b)(7). have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
(6)
If a permit applicant has two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(7)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
(c)

Sec. 7.5-66. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
The local issuing authority will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permitees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permitee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permitees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(c)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(d)
The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a).

Such owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a streetlight, or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or sign or sight triangle at intersections.
(2)
Tree limbs that grow near high voltage electrical conductors shall be maintained clear of such conductors by the electric utility company in compliance with any applicable franchise agreements.
(i)
Dead or diseased tree removal on private property. The city shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the city. The city tree board will notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by such owners at their expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. In the event of the failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the city shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of the removal to the owner's property tax notice.
(j)
Removal of stumps. All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground.

Appendix G: Additional Definitions
APPENDIX A. BASAL AREA DENSITY CREDIT
Density Credit is the value assigned to a tree, replacement or existing, that is reflective of its cross sectional area (measured at 12 inches above the ground for replacement trees and 4' above the ground for existing trees.) This cross sectional area is also known as basal area.
Example of Density Credit Calculation: an existing, 10″ diameter tree, measured 4′ above the ground has a cross sectional area of .6 feet.
Area Calculation: Pi × the (radius) squared of the 10″ diameter tree
or 3.1416 × (10/2) 2
or 3.1416 × (25) = 78.54 sq. inches
or 78.54/144 (squares inches in a square ft.) = .54
This value (.54) is rounded up to .6 Density Credit units.

1 30 4.4 4.4
Total Density Credit 21.4
Total Density Required 10.0
Excess Density Credit 11.4
  Example 2: Calculated density on a 2.5 acre site conserving the same number and sized trees used in Example 1.
a)
A commercial site with 2.5 acres disturbed area and no specimen trees would result in a density credit requirement of 25 units, calculated as follows:
2.5 acres × 10 Tree Density Units = 25 DC

1 30 4.4 4.4
Total Density Credit 21.6
Total Density Required 25.0
Additional Density Credit Required 3.4
  b)
The required density credit is 25. The existing density credit is 21.6.
25 ;minus; 21.6 = the amount of density credit needing to be replaced on the site.
25 ;minus; 21.6 = 3.4
c)
A total of 3.4 replacement units are required. See replacement tree density credit below.
Note: Any tree which qualifies as a Specimen Tree may receive special consideration for conservation (see Appendix E "Specimen Tree Credit").
2. Density credit values for replacement trees that will be planted on site to satisfy density credit requirements:
These density credits are based upon the expected size of the replacement tree in 10 years given its caliper at planting (i.e. a 2" caliper tree will have the density credit of .3 square feet 10 years from the date of planting).
EXPAND
Caliper @ 12 inches Density Credit Number of Trees Required to Meet 10 Units/Acre
Standard
2 .3 33
3 .4 25
4 .5 20
5 .6 16
6 .7 14
  Example 3: Calculated density for replacement trees.
Using the information from Example 2. an additional replacement density credit of 3.4 was required. Dividing the additional density credit required by the credit allocated to a particular sized replacement tree will yield the number of trees to be planted.
Using 3″ replacement trees: 3.4/.4 = 8.5 trees to be planted in addition to the trees conserved on the 2.5 acre site to meet the density credit requirement.
Notes:
A.
No more than 30% of all trees planted for replacement density may be of any one species.
B.
Pine trees to be planted to meet required replacement densities must be at least 2-inch caliper.

APPENDIX B. TREE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
A.
The following minimum tree protection measures must be in place for all tree save areas:
(1)
Trees identified for conservation on the "Tree Plan" shall have protection fencing that is a minimum of four (4) feet high installed at the edge of the critical root zones. All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with signage posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. Signs requesting workers' cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended at the site entrance(s).
(2)
All tree conservation zones shall be designed to prevent the sedimentation of erosion material. Silt fences must be placed along the outer uphill edges of tree protection zones at the land disturbance interface.
(3)
No person shall encroach into the tree protection zones. Construction activities, including but not limited to, parking, vehicle and foot traffic, material storage, concrete washout, debris burning, and other activities shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbance within the protected areas.
(4)
Reasonable efforts shall be made to locate utility lines along corridors between tree protection zones. If utility lines must encroach into the protection zones, they should be installed by tunneling rather than trenching.
(5)
All tree protection devices shall remain in fully functioning condition until the Certificate of Occupancy is issued.
(6)
Any tree, designated for conservation, which is negligently damaged during construction, as determined by the Planning Director or his/her agent, shall be treated according to the National Arborists Association Standards. If fatally damaged, as determined by the Planning Director or his/her agent, the tree(s) shall be replaced with four (4) inch caliper trees equal to the unit value of the tree removed. Any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to three (3) times the unit value of the tree removed.
(7)
It is recommended to apply a layer of mulch to the tree protection zones.
(8)
There shall be no construction activity inside the tree save areas, including but not limited to, grading, paving, and construction of buildings and other structures.
(9)
The site shall be designed and maintained in a manner to ensure proper drainage in tree save areas during and after construction.
B.
The developer shall designate a Tree Protection Supervisor. This person shall demonstrate knowledge in the area of tree protection practices during construction and shall be on site to ensure tree protection measures are enforced. The Tree Protection Supervisor shall participate in a Pre-Construction Conference with the City prior to the commencement of any land disturbance. The Tree Protection Supervisor must notify the City Planning Director immediately should any tree damage occur on the site.
C.
Tree Protection inspections shall be performed by a Certified Arborist or Registered Landscape Architect during construction. The inspections shall be conducted prior to the commencement of land disturbance, immediately following the clearing and grubbing phase, immediately following the grading phase, and at the end of the project before a Certificate of Occupancy is issued. The site shall be inspected to ensure all tree protection regulations are being met and to identify any existing or developing tree related problems that require treatment. An inspection report shall be prepared by the Certified Arborist or Registered Landscape Architect and certified by the inspector and submitted to the Planning Director. Any damage noted shall be treated according to the recommendation of the Planning Director or his/her agent prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The Planning Director or his/her agent shall have the authority to require additional reports should he/she determine significant construction damage has occurred.
(Ord. No. 3-06, 2-13-06)

Provided, however, that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the Administrator to be and designated a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance; provided further that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the Arborist to be and designated a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project. Specimen tree stand: Any collective group of specimen trees, as defined by this ordinance, which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the Arborist, and which meets one or more of the following:
a.
A relatively mature, even aged stand;
b.
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature or ecological value;
c.
A stand of historical significance;
d.
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
Specimen Tree Density Credit: Trees meeting the Specimen trees specifications above and whose roots zones are protected by a physical barrier (see detail) to a distance of 1.5 feet for every inch of trunk diameter measured at dbh will receive double the density credit afforded in Appendix A. Any encroachments of any type into this protected area will remove the "Specimen Tree" designation from this tree as well as the double density credit.

APPENDIX F. TREE PLANTING SPECIFICATIONS
Tree Planting - Basic Installation
1.
Soil surface requirements are 200 sq.ft. of open soil surface area for overstory trees and at least 75 sq.ft. of open soil surface area for understory trees.
2.
The planting area shall be tilled to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (deeper if the soil is compacted) for an area of 5 times the diameter of the root ball.
3.
Excavate a hole three times the diameter of the root ball and no deeper than the ball or container. Leave the soil at the base of the hole compacted.
4.
Remove the container, cut girdling roots and place tree in the hole. Plant one inch above existing soil line for every 10 inches of root ball depth (15 inch deep root ball planted 1.5 inches above existing soil line) no more and never below. For Ball and Burlap trees (B&B) place tree in the hole. Plant 1 to 2 inches above the existing soil line, no more and never below. Remove all ties and strapping, wire basket and burlap.
5.
Backfill the hole with un-compacted native soil previously removed to make the hole. Lightly pack the soil and water as you go to eliminate any air pockets. Construct a mulch ring at outer edge of planting hole and mulch planting area to a depth of 2 to 3 inches with composted wood chips. Do not mulch within 6 inches of the trunk. This will allow air circulate around the trunk root flare and top of the root ball.
6.
Stake tree only if wind throw is a significant issue and allow for at least 3 inches "slack" in tie wires. Never allow bare wires to contact bark. Remove stakes, and all wires, hoses and ties after first growing season.
