ARTICLE III. - CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT PLAN

Sec. 18-51. - Purpose.
A major disaster could include death or injury of key officials, partial or complete destruction of established seats of government, and the destruction of public and private records essential to continued operations of government and industry. Law and order must be preserved and government services maintained. Applicable portions of the Georgia Code and the constitution of the state provide authority for the continuity and preservation of local government.
Continuity of leadership and government authority is particularly important with respect to emergency services, direction of emergency response operations, and management of recovery operations. To this end, it is particularly essential that the county continue to function as a government entity.
Under the state's concept of mutual aid, local officials remain in control of their jurisdiction's emergency operations while others may provide additional resources upon request. A key aspect of this control is to be able to communicate official requests, situation reports and other emergency information throughout any disaster situation.
To ensure continuity of government, government at all levels must address seven elements:
(1)
Succession of officers;
(2)
Seat of government;
(3)
Emergency powers and authority;
(4)
Emergency plans;
(5)
Primary and alternate emergency operations center(s);
(6)
Preservation of vital records;
(7)
Protection of critical infrastructure;
(Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-52. - Succession of officers heading departments.
Georgia Code permits the political subdivision to provide for the succession of officers who head departments having duties in the maintenance of law and order or in the furnishing of public services relating to health and safety. The succession list is for the primary county emergency response functions.
(1)
Standby officers. Georgia Code permits the government body to appoint standby officers for each member of the governing body and up to three standby officers for the political subdivision's chief executive. The standby officer has have the same authority and powers as the regular officers.
(2)
Reconstituting the governing body with temporary officers. Georgia Code establishes a method for reconstituting the governing body. It authorizes that, should all members of the governing body, including all standby members, be unavailable, temporary officers shall be appointed by the governor.
(3)
Meeting of government body during an emergency. Georgia Code directs local governing bodies to convene as soon as possible whenever a state of emergency or local emergency exists and at a place not necessarily within the political subdivision.
(4)
Duties of governing body during an emergency. Georgia Code provides that the duties of the governing body during emergencies shall include ascertaining the damage to the political subdivision and its personnel and property, reconstituting itself and the political subdivision, and performing functions in preserving law and order and furnishing local services.

Sec. 18-54. - Seat of government.
In general, the seat of county government is that place where the board of commissioners is sitting and meeting. That place is:
White County Courthouse
59 South Main Street, Ste A
Cleveland, Georgia 30528
The chairman, or any other member of the board of commissioners may designate alternate or temporary seats of county government should that be necessary. The seat of county government may be the EOC, or its alternate location, during an extreme emergency.
(Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-55. - Emergency powers and authority.
The Georgia Emergency Management Act grants emergency powers to county leadership. Authority to take extraordinary measures during emergencies derives from county emergency ordinances and emergency orders that are authorized by the Georgia Emergency Management Act.
(Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-56. - Emergency plans.
The basis for a coordinated, effective response to a disaster is the emergency plan. Generally, the objectives of the emergency pan are to:
•
Foster a jurisdiction-wide systematic approach to planning.
•
Support a capability for prompt, coordinated response to large-scale disasters or threats simultaneously at all levels of government.
•
Provide a basis for assured continuity of government.
•
Promote uniformity in principles, policies and concepts of operations and compatibility of organizations and systems to facilitate coordinated response.
This plan, and other plans incorporated by reference, include those objectives as well as defining the relationship between it and response management. If emergency managers define emergency response as a series of decisions, the emergency plan can be viewed as a framework for decision-making. It structures the options from which a decision maker can choose. In other words, a plan composed of decisions made during "normal" times to help guide decisions during a disaster.
The emergency plan is linked to the response phase in two (2) important ways. First, during the planning process, the major agent-generated and response-generated demands are identified and strategies are developed for meeting them. The plan itself documents the strategies. Then, in the response phase, the strategies are evaluated and implemented. The second connection between planning and response management is exercises. Such activities should be mandated in the local emergency operations plan and viewed as part of the emergency planning process.
(Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-57. - Emergency operations center(s).
(a)
Responsibilities; structure; communication; location. As a place, the EOC differs greatly from one organization to another, but the functions are much less variable. As and entity, the EOC is responsible not only for assembling and directing local government response, but also for communicating with all other levels of government, with the private sector, and the public (both the public at large and the public at risk).
The EOC is structured to fulfill an organization standard that includes the functions of management, finance and administration, logistics, operations and planning and intelligence. Although each of the functions is necessary, coordination, communications and intelligence are critical. Communications is viewed as central, with coordination running a close second.
Communications issues are important to the emergency response capability. These issues include channel capacity, the importance of multiple channels, and the planning for a viable communications system.
The location of the White County EOC is located on the bottom floor of the Mauney Building, 1241 Helen Hwy, Suite 150. In case of a major disaster, this location may be moved at the discretion of the emergency management director.
Other rooms in the building will be identified as meeting rooms for section, branch and unit members, as required by the nature of the event.
(b)
Alternate emergency operations centers. Alternate emergency operations centers for the county are listed by priority:
(1)
White County Courthouse
59 South Main Street Ste A
Cleveland, Georgia 30528.
(2)
Helen City Hall
25 Alpenrosen Strasse
Helen, Georgia 30545.
(Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-58. - Preservation of vital records.
The preservation of vital records is of high importance to the county. The preservation of vital records is critical to the county's recovery from a catastrophic event. In addition to the information retrieval requirements of response, each response function has a record-keeping component. Although the principal focus of vital records preservation is to support recovery through reimbursement of disaster-related costs, vital records also have a broader and arguably more important function. Vital records become vital because they help describe a reasonably complete compilation of damage, death, physical and mental trauma, and allocation of public and private resources, making it possible to learn from the disaster experience.
Vital records for the county are maintained in several locations. A non-inclusive list includes the following:
EXPAND
Types of Records Stored
Birth, death and marriage certificates Probate office and Georgia Department of Vital Records - Atlanta
Property tax Tax commissioners office; tax assessors office; Georgia Department of Revenue and Local Government Services - Atlanta
Reimbursable projects Finance office - Board of commissioners
Personal property Tax assessors
Historical archives Historical society
Licenses and permits Licenses - Board of commissioners; Permits - Building inspections
Human resources Human resources office - Board of commissioners
  (Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08)
Sec. 18-59. - Protection of critical infrastructure.
During a disaster, public and private facilities will play varying roles in terms of importance. Their importance may be based on their day-to-day role and their expansion during an emergency, or upon unique circumstances common to the requirements of a particular emergency response.

Alpha-designator (consequence index) system. In order to set in place some system for determining the importance of critical facilities, an alpha-designator system or "consequence index" has been developed. The alpha-designator system was developed to assist public safety agency ability to assess the importance of a critical facility. It will also provide a uniform system for prioritizing incidents collateral to a major catastrophic event.

Critical category groupings. In addition to the alpha-designator, facilities will be grouped into one of three categories that describe their criticality to county viability:
a.
Category one. Damage to facilities or occupants will have a significant and immediate impact on White County's ability to effectively respond to or recover from a catastrophic event. These facilities have been identified by a public safety or public health agency as critical to public safety or health.
b.
Category two. Includes facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, will have a significant impact within 24 hours upon the county's continuity of operations in business or the public interest. It generally should be an operation that is normally un-interruptible in nature. Alternatively, it could have regional, statewide or national impact that could severely affect economic, governmental or industrial operations.
c.
Category three. Includes facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, can cause significant impact within 72 hours to the continuity of operations in business or other public interest.
