ARTICLE XI. - HOC HIGHWAY ORIENTED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

Section 1100. - Declaration of legislative intent.
The HOC highway oriented commercial district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for establishments offering accommodations, supplies or services to motorists, and for certain specialized uses such as retail outlets, extensive commercial amusements and service establishments which, although serving the entire community and its trading area, do not and should not be encouraged to locate in the retail commercial or nonretail commercial districts. The HOC highway oriented commercial districts ordinarily will be located along roads designated in the major thoroughfare plan as major highways. For the HOC district, the specific intent of this section is:
A.
To encourage the logical and timely development of land for HOC purposes in accordance with the objectives, policies and proposals of the future land use plan, the location of the HOC district shall be in accordance with the said city plan.
B.
To encourage the construction of, and the continued use of land for commercial, service and amusement uses serving both local and long distance travelers.
C.
To provide for orderly development and concentration of such uses within the HOC district as designated in the future land use plan.
D.
To provide appropriate space, and in particular, sufficient depth from the street, to satisfy the needs of modern commercial development where access is entirely dependent on the automobile.
E.
To encourage the development of the district with such uses and in such a manner as to minimize traffic hazards and interference from highway-oriented businesses.

Section 1104. - Development requirements.
The general plan for new highway oriented commercial districts shall include evidence and facts showing that it has considered and made provision for, and the development shall be executed in accordance with the following essential conditions:
A.
It shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses (see section 1101) and grouping of buildings, service and parking areas circulation and open spaces, planned and designed as an integrated unit (or to facilitate the ultimate creation of an integrated unit) in such a manner as to constitute a safe, efficient and convenient highway oriented commercial district.
B.
The proposed development or lot shall be constructed in accordance with an overall plan and shall be designed as a unified architectural unit.
C.
Adequate areas shall be provided for loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other vehicles; servicing by refuse collection, fuel, fire and other vehicles, automobile accessways, and pedestrian walks shall be constructed in accordance with Georgia Highway Department specifications. Service areas shall be screened from view from any abutting roadway and from within the parking area.
D.
Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to and from public highways serving the district without congestion to or interference with normal traffic flow.
E.
Access barrier. Each lot or center with its building, other structures, and parking and loading areas, shall be physically separated from each adjoining highway or street by a curb or other suitable barrier including a landscaped buffer strip against unchanneled motor vehicle ingress or egress. Such a barrier shall be located at the edge of the street line unless suitable curbs and gutters are provided within the highway or street right-of-way. Except for the accessways permitted below, such barrier shall be continuous for the entire length of any lot line adjoining a street or highway.
F.
Accessways. All permanent points of vehicular access to and from the public streets shall be located not less than 100 feet from the intersection of any public street lines; except that access may be permitted to a minor or secondary street within not less than 100 feet of its intersection with the major highway.
All accessways shall comply with the following requirements:
1.
Width of accessway. The width of any accessway leading to or from a street or highway shall not exceed 25 feet nor be less than 15 feet in width at the right-of-way. The alignment of accessways and curb return dimensions shall be determined through architectural and site approval.
2.
Spacing of accessways. In HOC districts no part of any accessway shall be nearer than 20 feet to any other accessway on the same lot, nor shall any part of an accessway be nearer than ten feet to any side or rear property line at its intersection with a street line. Insofar as practicable, the use of common accessways by two or more permitted uses shall be encouraged in order to reduce the number and closeness of access points along highways.
3.
Marginal access drives (or service streets). A 20-foot wide marginal access drive may be permitted so as to reduce the number of accessways and improve vehicular circulation within the HOC district. This drive would be located adjacent to the landscaped buffer area and extend parallel to the street line of the major highway. Access to this facility from the parking areas of the commercial establishments shall be so located as to facilitate traffic movement between the major highway (or intersecting road) the marginal access drive, and the parking area.
Prior to granting of approval of a development plan, the city shall ensure that adequate legal provisions are considered concerning the use, ownership, and responsibility of the marginal access drives.
G.
Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect the highway and neighboring properties from unreasonable direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind.
H.
The HOC district shall be permanently screened from adjoining and contiguous residential districts by a wall, fence, evergreen hedge or other suitable enclosure of minimum height five feet and maximum height seven feet, placed at least two feet inside the HOC district property line. The area between such enclosure and/or screening area may not be required if equivalent screening is provided by existing parks, parkways, recreational areas, or by topography or other natural conditions.
I.
No facility permitted in an HOC district shall be erected or used that is not adequately served with both sanitary sewers and public water unless authorized as a special exception and upon submission of satisfactory evidence to the fact that sanitary sewers and public water supply are not feasible in the particular location in question. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to a specific recommendation from the city engineer, local health officer, [or] official representative of the state health department.
