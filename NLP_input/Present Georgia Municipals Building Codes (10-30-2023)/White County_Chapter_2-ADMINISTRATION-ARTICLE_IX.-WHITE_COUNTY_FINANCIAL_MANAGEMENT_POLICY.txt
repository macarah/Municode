ARTICLE IX. - WHITE COUNTY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY[8]
Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— These adopted financial policies provide both the White County Board of Commissioners and county's administrative staff the framework needed for assisting in making financial decisions about the financial welfare of the county. Particularly in the areas of operating budgets and investments many financial decisions must be based on state statutes. While these policies provide a comprehensive approach to the financial well-being of White County, no policy herein shall be interpreted to limit or restrain any powers given to the constitutional officers provided under Georgia state law. Georgia governments are given much discretion in making many of their financial decisions. This document [article] will help county staff make these decisions in a fiscally sound manner.

DIVISION 1. - OPERATING BUDGET AND EQUITY

Sec. 2-321. - Operating budget and equity.
The budget process provides the primary mechanism by which key decisions are made regarding the levels and types of services the county provides within their estimated available resources. Budget policy guides this process. Budget policy also directs the county's financial health and stability and these policies provide the foundation for sound budget administration. State law provides much guidance for this topic of "do's and don'ts."
The county is responsible to the taxpayers to carefully account for public funds, manage county finances wisely and to plan for the provision of public services. Sound financial policies are necessary to carry out these objectives responsibly and efficiently. These policies incorporate long-standing principals and traditions that have served the county well in maintaining a sound and stable financial condition. Specifically, the purpose is to provide guidelines for planning, directing and maintaining day-to-day financial affairs.
Georgia law (e.g., O.C.G.A. § 36-81 et seq.) provides the budget requirements for Georgia local governments. These specific legal requirements are referenced throughout these budget policies, as applicable. The policies presented in this section provide an outline of the county's application of these state laws.
This section of the county's financial policies is divided into three subsections, general operating budget policies, specific operating budget policies, and equity.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-322. - General operating budget policies.
(a)
Scope. These operating budget and equity policies apply to all budgeted funds, which are the responsibility, and under the management of the county and its finance department, including the constitutional officers.
(b)
Financing current costs. Current costs shall be financed with current revenues, which may include the use of available fund balances carried forward from the prior year. The county shall avoid balancing current expenditures by obligating the use of future year's resources. The county shall strive to avoid short-term borrowing to meet cash flow requirements. However, the county may enter into short-term borrowing should a critical need arise (see Debt Issuance and Management Policies, division 6).
(c)
Budget requirements by fund type. The following budget requirements are established for the different funds the county uses (e.g., O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3):
(1)
General fund. The county adopts an annual budget for the general fund which shall provide for general government operations of the county and maintain working capital necessary for the county's financial health and stability.
(2)
Special revenue funds. The county adopts annual budgets for each special revenue fund, which demonstrates that any legally restricted revenue sources are used consistent with the applicable laws and/or regulations (e.g., the E-911 Fund).
(3)
Capital project funds. The county adopts a project budget for its capital project funds (e.g., the SPLOST Fund). However, the county also adopts an annual budget, consistent with the county's fiscal year.
(4)
Enterprise funds. Although generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or Georgia statutes do not require the county to adopt budgets for enterprise funds (e.g., the Solid Waste Fund), the county does adopt annual budgets for its enterprise funds in order to monitor revenues and control expenses. The county uses a business approach when budgeting enterprise funds.
(5)
Agency funds. GAAP and Georgia statutes do not require the adoption of budgets for the agency funds, since these funds primarily collect cash and forwards it to the general fund for the Constitutional Officers, or to other governmental agencies. These funds do not report operations; therefore, operating budgets are not necessary
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-323. - Specific operating budget policies.
The operating budget shall be prepared on an annual basis and include those funds detailed in this sub section that are subject to annual appropriation and project appropriation for the fiscal year July 1—June 30. Departments numbers are assigned to each department managed by the county manager as well as all offices of constitutional officers in order to maintain uniformity in the budget process.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-324. - Decentralized budget requests.
The county will utilize a decentralized operating budget process. All constitutional officers and departments are given an opportunity to participate in the annual budget process.
Each department and constitutional officer will have an opportunity to request personnel, services, supplies and capital items needed to carry-on its responsibility in an exemplary manner. However, the board of county commissioners may establish certain budget increase parameters, which may limit budget growth.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-325. - Departmental budget requests.
The budget process begins in January when the departments are supplied with budgetary worksheets to be completed with the departments' request for next fiscal year budget items. The budget is developed based on "line-item" expenditures in each department, focusing on expenditure objects such as personal services, purchased supplies and services, equipment, etc. within each department. Completed worksheets are submitted to county administration for review process and preparation. Budget work sessions are not required, however if the board of county commissioners holds a meeting or work session to review the recommended/proposed budget, the meeting or work session shall be advertised and held in accordance with the general requirements of open meetings.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-326. - Budget process and adoption.
Prior to May 15 each year, the county administration must submit a recommended budget to the board of county commissioners for their consideration. During the review process, a state required and legally advertised public hearing is conducted to obtain public comments. In addition, the recommended budget is available for public inspection in the county clerk's office. Prior to July 1 of the new budget year, the final budget is presented to the board of county commissioners by the county administration, after which the board of county commissioners adopts the budget through the passage of a budget resolution.(e.g., O.C.G.A. §§ 36-81-5 and 36-81-6).
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-327. - Estimating revenues.
The county will estimate its revenues conservatively, using an objective and analytical approach during the budget development. Revenues are estimated based upon historical trends and the county staffs independent analysis. Every attempt will be made to limit or reduce appropriations prior to increasing any fees and/or charges. However, in order to avoid a degradation of the county's service delivery, increases in charges and fees are adopted when necessary (see Revenue Administration, division 4).
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-328. - A balanced budget.
Each budgeted governmental fund shall have a balanced budget. Total anticipated revenues plus that portion of fund balance in excess of authorized reserves (see Equity Policies, division 1) that is designated as a budget-funding source shall equal total estimated expenditures for each fund (e.g., O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3).
Enterprise funds (less depreciation) expenses must equal estimated revenues.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-329. - The budgetary basis.
All government fund budgets shall be adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (i.e., the modified accrual basis of accounting) as promulgated by the governmental accounting standards board (GASB). Revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available and expenditures are charged against the budget when they become measurable or received (a fund liability has been incurred and that liability is due).
Enterprise fund budgets use the accrual basis of accounting.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-330. - Budget level of control.
The legal level of control is with the departments. Department managers may authorize line-item transfers within their departments with exception of salary related/personnel accounts. All increases in the bottom-line total of a department's budget must first be approved by the board of county commissioners in a public meeting
The county manager, holding the title of budget officer, may authorize budget transfers between departments within the same fund, and may also authorize amendments in salary related and capital outlay line items as long as the bottom-line total of the fund does not change.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-331. - Budget amendments.
The budget is a dynamic (forceful) plan which, when circumstances change, requires adjustments and formal budget amendments made. During the fiscal year, the board of county commissioners may need to amend the budget(s) for the funding of service level delivery policy changes, unforeseen catastrophic events or redirection of resources.
Generally, the board of county commissioners should approve amendments to the budget(s) before expenditures occur. However, due to emergencies and unforeseen circumstances, the board of county commissioners may confirm a budget amendment after the expenditures have occurred.
County administration will present budget amendments to the board of county commissioners in the form of a resolution at a regularly scheduled meeting, as necessary.
The board of county commissioners must amend the budget for all increases in total fund appropriations, and authorizes the county manager (budget officer) to approve budget transfers between departments in the same fund.
Any budget amendments must be adopted by resolution (i.e., the same process that is used to originally adopt the budget) (e.g., O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3).
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-332. - Utilization of prior year's fund balance in budget.
If necessary, the county may use fund balance in excess of the minimum reserve for working capital as a funding source for that fund's budget. The amount of unreserved fund balance shall be estimated conservatively, taking into consideration future year needs. The minimum requirement for the designation for working capital must first be met before utilizing the excess fund balance as a funding source for the budget. The board of commissioners recommends maintaining a minimum fund balance equivalent to three months reserve.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-333. - Appropriations at year-end.
All annual operating budget appropriations (i.e., including encumbered appropriations) shall lapse at the end of the fiscal year. Purchases encumbered in the current fiscal year, but not received until the following fiscal year, normally are charged against each department's subsequent year appropriation. However, the board of county commissioners may re-appropriate an encumbered order in the following fiscal year's budget through a budget amendment.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-334. - Budget reporting system.
The county shall maintain a system of budgetary control reports to assure adherence to the budget. The county makes available to departments monthly financial reports comparing actual revenues, and outstanding encumbrances and expenditures with budgeted amounts. Periodic reports are distributed to the departments to aid them to manage their budgets and enable the county manager to monitor the budget. The finance director shall present summary financial and budgetary reports to the board of county commissioners monthly.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-335. - Demonstrating legal compliance.
The county will demonstrate its legal compliance with its budget by presenting "budget to actual" comparison schedules within the county's published comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR). The general fund and any major special revenue funds' budgetary comparison statements will be represented as "basic financial information." All other budgetary comparison schedules will be presented as "supplementary information."
Generally, the budgetary comparison schedules are presented at the legal level of budgetary control (i.e., the department level). However in the spirit of "full disclosure," the county presents its general fund budgetary schedule by major object classification (e.g., personal services) within departments.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-336. - Contingencies.
The county shall establish a contingency line in the general fund, within the non-departmental budget, in order to accommodate unexpected operational changes, legislative impacts, or other economic events affecting the county's operations which could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time the budget was prepared.
The amount will vary depending upon available resources as determined during the budget process.
If any of the budgeted contingency is needed in a separate department, board of county commissioners approval is required. If approved, the finance department will transfer the appropriation from the contingency line item to the applicable line item(s) within the applicable department's budget. A contingency of two percent of the total general fund budget is recommended by the board of commissioners, to be implemented with the FY2022 budget.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-337. - Funding of defined contribution plan.
The county will fully fund its contribution to the defined contribution plan, consistent with current approved amounts.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-338. - Capital asset maintenance.
Within the resources available each year, the county shall maintain capital assets and infrastructure at a sufficient level to protect the county's investment, to minimize future replacement and maintenance costs, and to continue service delivery levels.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-339. - Contributions.
Outside contributions to programs operated by county departments shall be subject to the county's accounting and budgetary policies, therefore should be approved by the board of commissioners. The county welcomes both unrestricted and restricted contributions compatible with the county's programs and objectives. Any material contribution to be appropriated must have prior approval of board of county commissioners.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-340. - Privatization.
The county will encourage delivery of services by other public and private organizations whenever and wherever greater efficiency and effectiveness can be expected as well as develop and internally use technology and productivity advancements that will reduce or avoid increasing personnel costs. The intent is to control personnel costs as a proportion of the total budget, to more productively and creatively use available resources, and to avoid duplication of effort and resources.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-341. - Equity policies.
Financial responsibility. The county will live within its means. All departments supported by the resources of this county must function within the limits of the financial resources identified or available specifically to them. A balance must be maintained between revenues and expenditures, so that the public can realize the benefits of a strong and stable government. It is important to understand that this policy is applied to budget entities over periods of time which extend beyond current appropriations. By law, budgets cannot exceed available resources, defined as revenues generated in the current period added to balances carried forward from prior years. Temporary shortages, or operating deficits, can and do occur, but they are not tolerated as extended trends. The county will not develop a legacy of shortages or a legacy of mixing one-time resources and expect the continued delivery of services, the very reason for which it exists.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Secs. 2-342—2-354. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - FINANCIAL REPORTING

Sec. 2-355. - Financial reporting.
The government finance officers association (GFOA) executive board has adopted a body of recommended practices in the functional areas of public finance to give GFOA members and other state and local governments more guidance on sound financial management practices. Most of the following financial policies are consistent with the recommended accounting, auditing and financial report practices. These policies include three subsections, accounting, auditing and financial reporting.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-356. - Accounting.
The county shall maintain a system of financial monitoring, control, and reporting for all operations and funds in order to provide an effective means of ensuring that financial integrity is not compromised. In addition, such practices shall provide county officials with the necessary resources in order to make sound financial decisions.
(1)
Scope. This policy applies to all accounting records that are the responsibility and under the management of the county's finance department.
(2)
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The county will establish and maintain a high standard of accounting practices. Accounting standards will conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as promulgated by the governmental accounting standards board (GASB). The county also follows the financial accounting standards board's pronouncements issued on or before November 30,1989, unless they conflict or contradict GASB pronouncements.
(3)
Fund structure. The county will maintain the minimum number of funds consistent with legal compliance and sound financial administration. Also, the county will adhere to the mandatory fund structure included in the Georgia Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) chart of accounts (see below). In addition, funds shall be classified in conformity with GAAP. Further, all funds shall be reported within the county's comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR).
(4)
Chart of accounts. The Georgia General Assembly passed the Local Government Uniform Chart of Accounts and Reporting Act in 1997 (House Bill 491). This law requires the DCA to prepare and issue a standardized chart of accounts for Georgia governments. It shall be the policy of the county to implement and utilize the account classifications as the chart of accounts prescribes (O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3(e)).
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-357. - Auditing.
Georgia Law on Local Government Audits, O.C.G.A. § 36-81-7, requires an independent annual audit for the county. The annual independent audit shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and generally accepted governmental auditing standards (GAGAS). Auditor's opinions will be supplemented in the county's comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), and a copy of the audit will be sent to the state auditor who will respond with comments regarding compliance. Results of the annual audit shall be provided to the board of county commissioners in a timely manner. In addition, the county shall comply with the requirements of the general accounting office (GAO) and the office of management and budget (OMB) when audits are conducted relating to federal funding, consistent with the 1996 (and any future) amendments to the Single Audit Act.
(1)
Scope. This policy applies to all funds that are the responsibility and under the management of the county and its finance department.
(2)
Auditor qualifications. A properly licensed Georgia independent public accounting firm shall conduct the annual audit. The firm must have experience in auditing Georgia local governments. The firm must also be able to substantiate their audit staff has met the continuing education requirements and that the firm has had a "peer review" conducted.
(3)
Auditor independence. The auditors of the county's financial statements shall conform to the independence standard promulgated in the general accounting office's government auditing standards even if the audit engagements is not subject to generally accepted government auditing standards.
(4)
Choosing the audit firm. Upon request of the board of commissioners, the county will consider issuing a request for proposal to choose an audit firm for a period of five years with multiple year renewal options. The county will request two proposals from qualified public accounting firms. One proposal shall contain the firm's costs and a second will contain the firm's qualifications. The cost proposals shall only be opened after the qualified firms are chosen. When awarding the contract for the independent audit, the decision will be based more on technical qualifications rather than on cost.
The process and timing of choosing an audit firm will be at the discretion of the board of county commissioners.
(5)
Audit agreement. The agreement between the independent auditor and the county shall be in form of a written contract or an engagement letter. The contract or engagement letter shall include the request for proposal as an appendix to the written document and all issues addressed in the request for proposal shall be required as part of the contract or engagement letter.
(6)
Internal audit function. The national government finance officers association (GFOA) recommends that every government should consider the feasibility of establishing a formal internal audit function because such a function can play an important role in helping county management maintain a comprehensive framework of internal controls. Because of limited financial resources, the county has not established a separate internal audit function, rather the finance department should continue to develop and monitor internal controls until an internal auditor position can be funded.
(7)
Malfeasance and embezzlement. Any employee will be prosecuted to the extent of the law in any instance where the employee is proven to have committed an illegal act such as theft.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-358. - Reporting.
The finance department shall develop and maintain an ongoing system of financial reporting to meet the information needs of the county, authorities, and regulatory agencies. In addition, the board of county commissioners, constitutional officers, county manager, department managers, and the public shall have access to reports to allow them to monitor, regulate, and to use as a basis for future financial decisions.
(1)
Comprehensive annual financial report. In conjunction with the annual independent audit, the county shall prepare and publish a comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR). The county shall prepare the CAFR in conformity with GAAP and the GFOA's program requirements. Annually, the county will submit its CAFR to the GFOA to determine its eligibility to receive the GFOA's coveted "Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting" award.

DIVISION 3. - PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Sec. 2-370. - Procurement policies and procedures.

(1)
Consideration of the county's best interest in all transactions;
(2)
Purchasing without prejudice by seeking to obtain the best value from the most qualified responsible bidder; and
(3)
To subscribe to and work with honesty and truth in purchasing.
All departments of the county including the constitutional offices are subject to these procurement policies.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-371. - General policies.
(a)
Full and open competition. The county shall make every effort to obtain high quality goods and services at the best possible price. All procurement procedures will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any impropriety. All qualified vendors have access to county business. No bidder will be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded from providing goods and services to the county. Competition shall be sought for all procurement to the maximum extent possible. The conditions of all contracts shall be made clear in advance of the competition. Specifications shall reflect the needs of the county.
The county's procurement system shall encourage full and open competition on all purchases and sales.
The operation of the county's procurement system and surplus property disposal system shall be based upon competitive bidding whenever possible.
It is the responsibility of the ordering department manager's to ensure that an adequate selection of bidders is solicited for every bid to achieve optimum competition. This responsibility includes using various advertising methods when sources may be limited and personally contacting potential bidders either via phone, mail, e-mail or fax if deemed necessary. The finance department may assist by providing a list of applicable vendors previously registered in the county's system.
(b)
Interest of county officials or employees in expenditure of public funds. No official or employee of the county will have an interest directly or indirectly (e.g., a financial gain) in any transaction with, sale to, work for, or contract with the county or any department of the county or service involving the expenditure of public funds in violation of ethical conduct. The county shall not contract with, or purchase from, a vendor who is a member of the immediate family having a financial interest with that vendor (i.e. owner, director or officer) of a county commissioner, county manager, county attorney, county clerk, department head, HR director, or any finance department staff. The county shall not use a vendor for services in an operating department who is a member of the immediate family of an employee of that operating department.
(c)
Gifts and gratuities. Officials or county employees are not authorized to accept gifts or gratuities from any individual, company, firm or business establishment that is a vendor to the county or is marketing the county with regard to future purchases. Limitations should not be interpreted so as to prohibit acceptance of social courtesies such as meals and holiday gifts that contribute to good public relations or to prohibit employees from obtaining loans from established lending institutions.
(d)
Disclaimer of responsibility. The county will not be responsible for a purchase made by any county employee, county official, or an employee of any department utilizing public funds who fail to follow these procurement policies and procedures.
It shall be considered a "breach of duty" on the part of any employee who procures goods or services not consistent with the procurement policies contained herein. Any breaches shall be reported to the county manager, finance director, or constitutional officer, if applicable.
The board of county commissioners may disclaim responsibility and liability for any expenditure or agreement for expenditure arising from a procurement of goods and services made in its name, in the name of any governmental department under its fiscal authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside these policies. The cost of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-372. - Specific policies.
(a)
Procurement control. All county purchases will be generated at the department managers' request, however, the department manager may delegate to personnel within their department the authority to purchase certain commodities or services if such delegation is deemed advantageous.
(b)
Budget allocation. It is the respective department head's responsibility to ensure appropriations are budgeted before procurement occurs that obligates the county to pay for goods and/or services. Each respective department head or designee has the responsibility for reviewing budget authorization and availability prior to beginning the procurement process.
(c)
Procurement thresholds. The procurement of materials, supplies and services is an important function of the White County Government. Full cooperation between all departments of the county is essential to ensure smooth and cost-effective operations. In order to obtain the greatest value for every dollar spent; it is necessary to follow a set of established policies and procedures when purchases are made.
The purpose of these policies and procedures is to outline the principles guiding the White County purchasing function and to establish uniform departmental procedures to follow throughout the county government when making purchases.

(6)
Ethical standards. White County employees involved in the purchasing process shall discharge their duties in an impartial and unbiased manner so as to ensure fair and competitive access to procurement by responsible vendors and contractors. Further, they shall conduct themselves in a manner, which fosters public confidence in the integrity of the White County procurement process. To achieve this purpose, it is essential that White County personnel involved in the procurement process observe certain prescribed ethical conduct standards.
a.
Gratuities. It shall be considered unethical for any person to offer, give or agree to give any county employee or official or for any county employee or official to solicit, demand, accept or agree to accept a gratuity or benefit in connection with any purchasing or procurement decision (refer to 2-371(c)).

(7)
Emergency purchases. The county department head with the county manager's approval may make or approve emergency purchases of supplies, materials, goods, and services when there exists a threat to public health, welfare or safety or in the event of an emergency which requires immediate action, provided that such emergency procurement shall be made with as much competition as is possible and practical under the prevailing circumstances. Such emergency purchases shall be thoroughly documented by the department head and shall include a written report explaining the basis for the emergency and for selection of the particular contractor. Such documentation shall be forwarded to the county manager within three working days after the occurrence. Failure of a department head to plan shall not be considered sufficient grounds for making such emergency purchases.
(8)
Professional services. Procurement for certain professional services such as engineering, architectural, legal, and audit services are exempted by state law from bidding requirements (but still require board of commissioners' approval as a contracted service) and may be subject to exemption from these policies and procedures (O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(c)).
(d)
Informal purchasing procedures ($500.00 to $10,000.00). All departments must prepare a purchase order for any purchase over $500.00. The required price quotes must be submitted with the requisition for purchases over $2,000.00. It is the responsibility of the requesting department to determine the estimated cost of the requisitioned item or service and when the price of the requisitioned items or service may increase, or if other charges are to be added to the invoice (i.e., freight, fuel adjustment or other miscellaneous charges) each is to be noted on the requisition. Purchases of $2,000.00 or less require only department manager's approval. Purchases over $2,000.00 and less than $10,001.00 require the county manager's approval. The county manager will provide notification to the board of commissioners for purchases over $5,000.00.
(1)
The department manager verifies the availability of funds to purchase the requested item(s) or service, issues a purchase order to the vendor for supplies and/or services.
(2)
The user department will then arrange the delivery as to time and place desired. When delivered, the department must check the items against the purchase order and delivery ticket to confirm receipt of full order. The invoice and all associated documents are forward to finance department (with signed approval) for processing of payment.
(e)
Formal sealed bids procedures ($10,001.00 to and over).
(1)
Formal sealed bids shall be used when the following conditions exist:
a.
There are clear specifications;
b.
Basis of award is price (as related to quality desired);
c.
There are several bidders who can provide the product or service;
d.
There is more than one brand or product that meets the requirements or the specified brand can be obtained through more than one source;
e.
There is adequate time to advertise or solicit bids.
(2)
The requisitioning department will confirm availability of funds to purchase the requested item or service.
(3)
If authorized, an invitation to bid document will be produced by the county administration. The bid specifications will be written so as not to exclude nor favor any vendor whenever possible.
(4)
For bids over $25,000.00: The invitation to bid will be advertised in the county's legal organ for a minimum period of once a week for two weeks prior to the designated bid opening or in accordance with state law. Public works construction contracts are required to be advertised for four consecutive weeks in accordance with local government public works construction law.
(5)
Every opportunity will be made to have the competitive bidding open to as large a number of bidders as is practically possible. A minimum of three vendors will be contacted to submit sealed bids, if available. The following process will be used to ensure competitive bidding:
a.
Advertisement in local and surrounding area newspapers;
b.
Area yellow pages searched to locate possible vendors;
c.
Referencing of past bid/proposal files to locate vendors;
d.
Internet searches for appropriate vendors;
e.
Placement of bid/proposal announcement on the county's website.
As bids are received, they will be stamped as to date and time they arrived.
(6)
At the time and place specified in the invitation to bid, the bids will be opened publicly and read aloud in the presence of a representative of county administration. Bidders are not allowed to alter bid packages in any way after they have been opened at the bid opening time. Late bids will not be accepted.
(7)
County administration will evaluate all submitted bids on the basis of the lowest responsive bid and responsible bidder. A responsive bid is one that meets all bid specifications and requirements of the bid document. A responsible bidder is one who is capable to best deliver the product or service indicated in the bid package, has a favorable past performance of delivery, and positive references. County administration and the user department will evaluate the technical aspects of the product or service to determine if it meets the bid specifications. After the evaluation is completed, a recommendation will be made to the board of county commissioners for their consideration of awarding the bid. The board of county commissioners specifically reserves the right to accept or reject any or all bids and to waive any technicalities and formalities.
(8)
The successful bidder will be contacted and a purchase order will be issued.
(f)
Formal sealed proposals ($25,000.00 and up). Formal sealed proposals will be handled and processed in the same manner as formal sealed bids. This process may be used when clear specifications are not available or when a service is required.
In this procurement method, qualifications will be primary and price is used in the evaluation of the proposals. The basis of award is the criteria outlined in the proposals, which should be sealed separately and opened only once all other criteria has been met and scored. In the public opening, only the names of the companies offering the proposals will be read. Because negotiations are still possible, the contents of the proposal will not be released until the item or service has been evaluated and awarded. It is county administration's responsibility to determine the method of purchase and to select the bid or the proposal method that is in the best interest of the county. (Exception—Road projects are not governed by this method in accordance with O.C.G.A § 32-4-63 (1).)
(g)
Cancellation or rejection of bids or proposals. The board of commissioners reserves the right to cancel any outstanding formal sealed bids prior to the opening of the bids and also reserves the right, after the bid opening but prior to the award of a bid, to reject, in whole or in part, any bids or proposals. Any cancellations or rejections should be consistent with these procurement policies and procedures.
(h)
Change orders. All work order changes, on projects that required prior board approval, shall be presented to the board of commissioners for approval prior to the change taking place. The county may make written changes to the plans, specifications, scheduling, and performance period of any contract
(i)
Purchase orders and changes. If additional items and/or services are needed for a previously issued purchase order or additional charges will increase the purchase threshold level to a higher amount, the original purchase order will need to be corrected by the approved level of authority. This may be done by cancelling the original purchase order and re-issuing a new one or manually correcting the original with proper authority approval.
(j)
Violations of purchasing procedures. All employees are expected to follow these purchasing policies and procedures. If not followed, disciplinary actions may result.
(k)
Capital assets (fixed assets). Some purchases, due to their dollar value, are considered capital assets because of their projected life time being five to 50 years or more, such as land, land improvements, buildings, equipment and machinery, vehicles, computer equipment, advanced technological equipment, such as GIS. Purchases of items valued over $5,000.00 individually are considered a capital expense. Roads and bridges are also capital assets having a lifetime usefulness of 15 to 50 years. These purchases are recorded in the fixed asset software and reconciled against the general ledger. They are monitored closely by auditors, and must balance at year end. Control over and proper recording of these assets is essential for efficient financial report and management. As required by GASB34, financial reporting in done each year depicting the depreciation of fixed assets. Fixed assets recording is done in the finance department where entries in accounts payable (eventually going to general ledger) and asset reporting are maintained. Assets such as land, building, some equipment and vehicles are also covered with liability insurance.
(1)
Criteria for a fixed asset is:
a.
Tangible in nature;
b.
Value of $5,000.00 or greater per item;
c.

(m)
Local bidder privilege. All vendors/potential vendors of White County shall have on file with the county current up-to-date documents that are listed in White County's Vendor Packet. (Refer to vendor packet)
Because bids awarded to "local" vendors contribute to the White County tax base and promote the local economy, the White County Board of Commissioners has determined that under certain circumstances, such "local" vendors shall be provided an additional privilege when bidding against non-local vendors.
Purchases and services may be made and acquired from vendors located and doing business within White County whenever the price is the lowest reasonable price and the vendor otherwise meets the specifications of the bid, or whenever the price differential between bids is no more than five percent of the total. This local preference does not apply to public works construction projects subject to public works contracts exceeding $100,000.00 in accordance with chapter 91 of title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia also known as the "Georgia Local Government Public Works Construction Law or "Road Construction" projects exceeding $200,000.00 in accordance with chapter 4 title 32 of the Official Code of Georgia.
A "local" vendor for purposes of this section shall be defined as a vendor maintaining a physical presence within White County, including, but not limited to the maintenance of one or more offices within White County with continuous employment of not fewer than two persons at such office(s) for more than six months prior to the submission of such bid. The mere maintenance of a post office box within White County shall not qualify a vendor as "local" for purposes of this policy.
(n)
Special issues.
(1)

(4)
If alternates are offered in the bidding/proposal process, a full explanation of how the alternative will meet the required specifications shall be submitted with the bid/proposal. The county shall reserve the right to accept or reject any or all of the alternative proposals.
(5)
In certain situations that involve highly technical solutions, a mandatory pre-bid conference may be required. If so required this will be noted in the advertisement for bids, and only bids from those potential bidders in attendance will be considered.
(6)
In the event a bidder is awarded a bid or proposal by the board of county commissioners and the selected bidder fails to fulfill the conditions of the award, county administration shall have the authority to award the bid to the second most responsive and responsible bidder without rebidding. If the second bidder cannot fulfill the conditions of the award, county administration shall have the authority to award the bid to the third most responsive and responsible bidder without rebidding. If the third bidder cannot fulfill the conditions of the award, county administration will re-bid the item or service.
(7)
Vendors will be required to sign a form that states that they agree to the terms and conditions contained in the bid/proposal package as well as applicable federal, state, and local laws.
(8)
Each vendor shall sign a form indicating that no act(s) of collusion have taken place in the bid/proposal process.
(9)
If a bidder has a grievance regarding these bidding procedures or their application, the bidder must first file a written grievance with county administration within ten days of the bid award. If county administration cannot resolve the grievance in a satisfactory manner to the bidder, the bidder may appeal to the board of county commissioners.

(p)
State of Georgia procurement contracts. The county is authorized to use any State of Georgia statewide contracts through the Georgia Department of Administrative Services, in lieu of obtaining quotes or issuing competitive sealed bids when it is to the economic advantage of the county (O.C.G.A. § 50-5-100). The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for goods or service. If used, the state contract number shall be referenced on all associated documents.
(q)
Sole source procurement. Sole source procurement is permissible if a required good or service is available from only a single supplier. A requirement for a particular proprietary item does not justify sole source procurement if there is more than one potential bidder for that item or service. The county manager may approve sole source procurements, between $1,000.00 and $10,000.00, when there is a clear and compelling reason that sole source is justified.
(r)
Public works construction. The Georgia Local Government Public Works Construction Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1) establishes the basic requirements that all counties must follow when hiring private contractors to perform construction projects other than road construction that cost more than $100,000.00 to ensure that public works contracts are awarded in a fair and competitive manner. The county shall issue formal sealed bids or proposals for all public works construction contracts estimated to cost $10,000.00 or more, or in other words, the county will be more restrictive than state law. Retainage of 2.5 percent to ten percent may be held based on the project cost and nature of the project.
(s)
Road construction. O.C.G.A. § 32-4-63(1) outlines state law regarding road construction projects that all counties must follow when hiring private contractors to perform road construction or maintenance projects that cost more than $200,000.00. The county shall issue formal sealed bids for road construction or maintenance projects estimated to cost $10,000.00 or more that will be performed by private contractors. Road construction contracts must be awarded to the lowest responsive bidder.

Secs. 2-375—2-384. - Reserved.
DIVISION 4. - REVENUE ADMINISTRATION

Sec. 2-385. - Revenue administration.
The county levies, collects and records certain taxes, license and permit fees, intergovernmental revenues, charges for services, investment earnings, fines and forfeitures, and other miscellaneous revenues and financing sources. This policy provides direction in the application, acceptance and administration of revenues the county receives.
(1)
Diversification and stability. All revenues have particular characteristics in terms of stability, growth, sensitivity to inflation or business cycle effects, and impact on the tax and rate payers. A diversity of revenue sources can improve a county's ability to handle fluctuations in revenues and potentially help to better distribute the cost of providing services.
The county shall strive to maintain a diversified and stable revenue structure to shelter it from short-term fluctuations in any primary revenue source. When possible, the revenue mix shall combine elastic (e.g., sales taxes) and inelastic (e.g., property taxes) revenue sources to minimize the effect of economic downturns.
The county will work towards diversifying its revenue base in order to reduce its dependence upon property taxes.
(2)
Revenue budget estimates. As part of the annual budget process, an objective analytical process will estimate revenues realistically and prudently. The county finance department will estimate revenues of a volatile nature conservatively.
(3)
User based fees and charges (exchange revenues). The county will strive to keep the revenue system simple which will result in a decrease of compliance costs for the taxpayer or service recipient and a corresponding decrease in avoidance to pay. The county will avoid nuisance taxes, fees, or charges as revenue sources.
The county's revenue system will strive to maintain equity in its structure. That is, the county will seek to minimize or eliminate all forms for subsidization between entities, funds, services, and customers. However, it is recognized that public policy decisions may lead to subsidies in certain circumstances.
When establishing user charges, the following issues will be considered:
a.
Ability to pay;
b.
Pricing to limit or encourage demand;
c.
Identifiable benefits;
d.
Discourage waste; and
e.
Cost of collection.
For services associated with a user fee or charge, a fee shall offset the costs of that service, where possible. Costs of services include direct and indirect costs such as operating and maintenance costs, administrative costs, and charges for the use of capital (e.g., depreciation and/or debt service).
(4)
Determining the amount of user fees and charges. The level of user fee cost recovery should consider the county-wide versus special service nature of the program or activity. The use of general purpose revenues is appropriate for county-wide services, while user fees are appropriate for services that are of special benefit to easily identified individuals or groups.
Fees will be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that they keep pace with changes in the cost-of-living as well as changes in methods or levels of service delivery. Any desires to increase fees and/or charges will be presented to the county manager, who after reviewing and agreeing to increases will propose changes to the board of county commissioners, in a public meeting, for approval. No county department can charge a fee which has not been adopted by the board of commissioner.
(5)
Updating user fees and charges. The county will review all user fees and charges annually in order to keep pace with the cost of providing that service. This review normally will occur during the development of the annual operating budget.
The county will consider changing fee rates when:
a.
The fee is not covering its costs; or
b.
The fee is covering its costs and generates excess revenue that in turn cross-subsidizes other services, unless public policy suggests otherwise.
(6)
New user fees and charges. When imposing new fees and/or charges, the proposed fee/charge should be examined using the following criteria:
a.
Sufficiency fees and/or charges should recover the full cost of issuance, administration, and enforcement, recognizing that adjustments may be necessary for the benefit of the public;
b.
Efficiency fees/charges should be designed for easy, inexpensive administration by the county and easy, inexpensive compliance by, the individual/business paying the fee/charge. A minimum of the revenue raised through the collection of a fee/charge should be consumed in the process of raising it; and
c.
Simplicity fees/charges should be understood easily by the payee and county officials, leaving as small a margin as possible for subjective interpretations.
If the new fee would recover costs of a service previously funded by general revenue, the county should examine a decrease in general taxes or decide on a use of the liberated revenues.
(7)
Alternative revenue sources. The county shall seek alternative funding sources whenever possible to reduce the required revenue from non-exchange transactions (e.g., property taxes). Such alternative sources include private and public grants, federal or state assistance, and public and private contributions.
(8)
Revenue collection. The county will follow an aggressive policy of collecting revenues, consistent with state and federal laws. This policy includes charging of penalties and interest on delinquent payments, revoking county licenses, and providing for the transferring and assignment of tax executions.
Real property will be sold to satisfy non-payment of property taxes by the tax commissioner.
(9)
Rates and charges. The board of county commissioners shall approve all revenue rates, charges, and processes in association with receipted funds that are deposited by the county.
(10)
Raising property taxes. Property tax rates shall be maintained at a rate adequate to fund a basic service level. Based upon taxable values, millage rates will be adjusted to fund this service level.
(11)
Deposit account fraud (bad/returned checks). According to the Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A § 16-9-20) the definition of a criminal bad check is defined as:
a.
A person commits the offense of deposit account fraud when such person makes, draws, utters, executes, or delivers an instrument for the payment of money on any bank or other depository in exchange for a present consideration or wages, knowing that it will not be honored by the drawee. For the purposes of this Code section, it is prima-facie evidence that the accused know that the instrument would not be honored if:
1.
The accused had no account with the drawee at the time the instrument was made, drawn, uttered, or delivered;
2.
Payment was refused by the drawee for lack of funds upon presentation within 30 days after delivery and the accused or someone for him or her shall not have tendered the holder thereof the amount due thereon, together with a service charge, within ten days after receiving written notice that payment was refused upon such instrument. For purposes of this paragraph:
Notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail or statutory overnight delivery evidenced by return receipt to the person at the address printed the instrument or given at the time of issuance shall be deemed sufficient and equivalent to notice have been received as of the date on the return receipt by the person making, drawing, uttering, executing, or delivering the instrument. A single notice shall be sufficient to cover all instruments on which payment was refused and which were delivered within a ten-day period by the accused to a single entity, provided that the form of notice lists and identifies each instrument; and
• The form of notice shall be substantially as follows:
As insufficient funds notifications are received in the White County's Finance Department a copy of the notification is sent to the department who initially received the instrument. Attempts will be made by the county to contact the issuer to clear the matter. An administrative/service charge of $30.00 or five percent of the face of the check/instrument (whichever is greater) will be applicable. Payments made to resolve NSF checks may be cash only or applied to a credit/debit card that is not declined at the time of resolving. If the matter is unable to be cleared—the finance department will file the complaint with magistrate court for resolution.

Adjustments from appropriations that have been obligated, committed, or reserved for a designated purpose shall not be transferred until formal a de-obligation occurs. The de-obligation of budget dollars to a specific project will only occur after the completion of the project, or when a project was identified and budget and funding is no longer necessary.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-401. - Contracts.
(a)
Construction contracts. All capital projects must be included in a formal construction contract and the contract must be approved by the board of county commissioners. All other contract components must be consistent with the county's purchasing rules and regulations.
(b)
Construction contract change orders. All construction contract change orders must be supported by county staff recommendations and must be approved by the capital project architect and/or project engineer (if applicable) and each must be approved by the board of county commissioners in a public meeting. All other contract change order components must be consistent with the county's purchasing rules and regulations.
(c)
Coordination with debt policy. If the board of county commissioners determines that borrowing is necessary to finance a capital project the financing will be coordinated with the debt policies of the county (see Debt Issuance and Management Policies, division 6).
ALL POTENTIAL CONTRACTS MUST BE PRESENTED TO AND APPROVED BY THE WHITE COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. ONLY THE WHITE COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS HAS AUTHORITY TO OBLIGATE COUNTY FUNDS.
IT IS REQUIRED THAT A COPY OF ALL APPROVED CONTRACTS BE ON FILE IN THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE.

DIVISION 6. - DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT

Sec. 2-415. - Debt issuance and management.
(a)
Debt issuance. The county recognizes the foundation of any well-managed debt program is a comprehensive debt policy. A debt policy sets forth the parameters for issuing debt and managing outstanding debt and provides guidance to decision makers regarding the timing and purposes for which debt may be issued, types and amounts of permissible debt, method of sale that may be used and structural features that may be incorporated. The debt policy should recognize a binding commitment to full and timely repayment of all debt as an intrinsic requirement for entry into the capital markets. Adherence to a debt policy helps to ensure that a government maintains a sound debt position and that credit quality is protected. Advantages of a debt policy are as follows:
(1)
Enhances the quality of decisions by imposing order and discipline, and promoting consistency and continuity in decision making;
(2)
Rationalizes the decision-making process;
(3)
Identifies objectives for staff to implement;
(4)
Demonstrates a commitment to long-term financial planning objectives; and
(5)
Is regarded positively by the rating agencies in reviewing credit quality.
The policies also:
(1)
Establish criteria for the issuance of debt obligations so as not to exceed acceptable levels of indebtedness;
(2)
Transmit a message to investors and rating agencies that the county is committed to sound financial management; and
(3)
Provide consistency and continuity to public policy development.
Issuing debt commits the county's revenues several years into the future, and may limit its flexibility to respond to changing service priorities, revenue inflows, or cost structures. Adherence to this debt policy helps ensure that the county issues and manages its debt prudently in order to maintain a sound financial position and protect its credit rating.
Georgia law provides the authorizations and requirements for debt issuances by Georgia local governments. These specific legal requirements are referenced throughout the debt policies, as applicable.
(b)
Conditions for issuing long-term debt. Debt financing for capital improvements and equipment generally will be used when at least one of the following conditions exist:
(1)
When one-time, non-continuous projects (those not requiring annual appropriations) are desired;
(2)
When the county determines that future users will receive a benefit from the capital improvement that the debt financed;
(3)
When the project is necessary to provide basic services to county residents;
(4)
When total debt, including debt issued by overlapping governments (e.g., the school board), does not constitute an unreasonable burden to county taxpayers.
(5)
Exhausting the use of all other possible revenue sources to provide alternative funding for capital projects.
(c)
Conditions for issuing short-term debt. The county will limit its short-term borrowing to cover cash flow shortages through a bank loan or the issuance of tax anticipation notes (TANS) (Georgia Constitution, article 9, section 5, paragraph 5).
(d)
Limitation on debt issuance. Georgia law limits the amount of general obligation debt that the county may issue to ten percent of the assessed value of all taxable property located within the boundaries of the county (Georgia Constitution, article 9, section 5, paragraph 1). However, the county takes a more conservative approach and limits the issuance of general obligation debt to five percent of this assessed value.
The amount of general long-term debt financing for capital assets (i.e., through capital leases) may be 100 percent of the fair market value of the purchase.
(e)
Sound financing of debt. When the county utilizes debt financing, the following activities will occur to ensure that the debt is soundly financed:
(1)
Analysis of the financial impact, both short-term and long-term, of issuing the debt;
(2)
Conservatively projecting the revenue sources that the county will use to repay the debt;
(3)
Insuring that the term of any long-term debt the county incurs shall not exceed the expected useful life of the asset the debt financed;
(4)
Maintaining a debt service coverage ratio (i.e., for revenue secured debt) that ensures that the revenues pledged for the repayment of the outstanding debt will be adequate to make the required debt service payments.
(f)
Refunding debt. The county will consider refunding outstanding bonds when the net present value savings (net of issuance costs and any other cash contribution), as a percentage of the refunding bonds should be at least "three percent—five percent."
(g)
Debt retirement. Generally, borrowings by the county should be of a duration that does not exceed the economic life of the capital improvement that it finances and where feasible, should be shorter than the projected economic life. To the extent possible, the county should design the repayment of debt so as to recapture rapidly its credit capacity for future use.
Annual budget appropriations shall include debt service principal and interest payments and reserve requirements for all debt currently outstanding.
(h)
Full disclosure. The county shall follow a policy of full disclosure in financial reporting and with the preparation of a bond prospectus.
(i)
Legal compliance. When issuing debt, the county shall comply with all legal requirements, including the continuing disclosure requirements. This compliance includes adherence to local, state and federal legislation and bond covenants.
More specifically, the finance director is responsible for maintaining a system of record keeping and reporting to meet the arbitrage rebate compliance requirements of the federal tax code. This effort includes tracking investment earnings on bond proceeds, calculating rebate payments in compliance with tax law, and remitting any rebatable earnings to the federal government in a timely manner in order to preserve the tax-exempt status of the county's outstanding debt issues. Additionally, general financial reporting and certification requirements embodied in bond covenants are monitored to ensure that all covenants are complied with.
The county will comply with Amended SEC Rule 15c2-12 (the "rule") by providing secondary market disclosure for all long-term debt obligations, which are subject to the rule. As required, the county will submit annual financial information to all nationally recognized municipal securities repositories pursuant to the rule, on a timely basis.
(j)
Credit ratings. The finance director is responsible for maintaining relationships with the rating agencies that assign ratings to the county's various debt obligations. This effort includes providing periodic updates on the county's general financial condition along with coordinating meetings and presentations in conjunction with a new debt issuance.
Credit ratings are the rating agencies' assessment of the county's ability and willingness to repay debt on a timely basis. Credit ratings are an important indicator in the credit markets and can influence interest rates the county must pay. Each of the rating agencies believes that debt management is a positive factor in evaluating issuers and assigning credit ratings. Therefore, implementing debt management practices will be viewed positively by the rating agencies and could influence the county's credit rating and ultimately lower borrowing costs.
When the county issues bonds, it will consider insuring the bonds, which essentially results in the highest bond rating possible which may result in lower interest costs.
(k)
Relationship with capital improvement program. All bond issue requests shall be coordinated by the finance department during the annual budget process. Requests for the issuance of new bonds must be identified during the process.
(l)
Competitive financing. The county generally will conduct financings on a competitive basis. However, negotiated financings may be used due to market volatility or the use of an unusual or complex financing or security structure.
(m)
Using financial specialists. The county employs outside financial specialists to assist it in developing a bond issuance strategy, preparing bond documents, and marketing bonds to investors. The key players in the county's financing transactions include its financial advisor and bond counsel, the underwriter and county representatives.

DIVISION 7. - DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

Sec. 2-425. - Deposit and investment management.
This policy establishes overall guidelines for the deposit and the investment of financial assets for the benefit of the county. The finance department is responsible for the management of daily receipt and investment of cash and related accounting operations. The following policies are to be judged and understood in light of that overall sense of stewardship. In that regard, the basic investment standards shall be those of a prudent investor as articulated in applicable state statutes.
Much of the "Investment Management Policies" are modeled after the government finance officers associations' (GFOA) best practices document titled, "GFOA Sample Investment Policy."
This section of the county's financial policies is divided into three subsections, general policies, deposit management policies and investment management policies. Although the county primarily invests their available resources in the State of Georgia Investment Pool (see investment policy 3-H), incorporated within are somewhat sophisticated investment policies, if needed at a later date.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-426. - General policies.
(a)
Scope. This investment policy applies to all cash and investments, which are the responsibility, and under the management of the county and its finance department.
(b)
Pooled cash and investment management. All non-restricted cash and investments will be maintained in a single cash and investment pool allowing for the maximum use of available resources. The county shall maintain an accounting system that allows non-restricted assets to be pooled, while separately recorded on the general ledger. All available idle cash shall be invested.
(c)
Allocation of investment earnings. Investment earnings from the pooled cash and investments will be allocated to each investing fund consistent with fund ownership in the pool. The investment earnings shall be allocated monthly, based upon each fund's average monthly balance. The allocation of the investment earnings process shall coincide with the month end close process.
(d)
Ethics and conflicts of interest. County officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the board of county commissioners any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the county, and they shall further disclose any large personal financial or investment positions that could be related to the performance of the county's portfolio.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-427. - Deposit management.
(a)
Choosing depositaries. The national GFOA suggests that state and local governments initiate competitive-bidding and negotiation processes, in accordance with the state and local laws and regulations, for major banking services. Currently, the county banks locally and will expand this policy, if needed.
(b)
Collateralization. The county shall require pledges of collateral from the depository institution covering at least 110 percent of the deposits. This requirement is in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 36-83-5; 45-8-12; 50-17-59; and 45-8-13.
(c)
Receipts and deposits. Deposits should be made by departments, at a minimum, weekly. Cash and or checks should never be held for more than seven days before depositing. All funds must be kept in secure location prior to deposits being made. After bank deposits are made, all receipt and deposit documentation should be turned in to the finance department within one week.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-428. - Investment management.
(a)
General investment objectives. The primary objective in the investment of county funds under control of the county is to ensure the safety of principal, while managing liquidity requirements of debt service and other financial obligations of the county, providing the highest investment return using authorized investment instruments, and promoting economic development in the county.
(1)
Safety. The safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. County investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required to ensure that the finance director prudently manages market, interest rate and credit risk. Each investment purchase shall be limited to those defined as eligible under Georgia Statutes (see below).
a.
Credit risk. The county will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by:
1.
Limiting investments to the safest types of securities.
2.
Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and advisers with which the county will do business.
3.
Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized.
b.
Interest rate risk. The county will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, by:
1.
Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.
2.
Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, certificates of deposit, money market, mutual funds, or the State of Georgia Local Government Investment Pool.
(2)
Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the county to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (i.e., static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (i.e., dynamic liquidity). A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in money market mutual funds or the State of Georgia Local Government Investment Pool which offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds.
(3)
Return on investments. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions:
a.
A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal.
b.
Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
(4)
Economic development and local considerations. The county seeks to promote economic development in the county through various programs that provide incentives for community reinvestment and financial assistance.
(b)
Delegation and authority. The responsibility for conducting investment transactions resides with the finance department. The county's finance director is designated as investment officer and is responsible for investment decisions and activities, under the direction of the county manager. The finance director shall develop and maintain written administrative procedures for the operation of the investment program, consistent with all investment policies. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of the investment policies and the procedures established by the finance director.
(c)
Prudence. The standard of prudence used by investment officials is the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy.
Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
(d)
Safekeeping and custody. If the county decides to invest in the public investment market, a list will be maintained of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services to the county. In addition, a list also will be maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness (e.g., a minimum capital requirement of $10,000,000.00 and at least five years of operation). These may include "primary" dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (i.e., uniform net capital rule).
All investment securities purchased by the county shall be held in third-party safekeeping by an institution designated as primary agent. The primary agent shall issue a safekeeping receipt to the county listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other pertinent information. The county shall require pledges of collateral from the depository institution covering at least 110 percent of the investment. This requirement is in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 36-83-5; 45-8-12; 50-17-59; and 45-8-13. Deposit-type securities (i.e., certificates of deposit) also shall be collateralized at 110 percent of the face value.
(e)
Internal controls. The finance director is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the county are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that:
(1)
The cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2)
The valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.
Accordingly, the finance director shall establish a process for an annual independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with policies and procedures. This process should be part of the external audit. The internal controls shall address the following points:
(1)
Control of collusion;
(2)
Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping;
(3)
Custodial safekeeping;
(4)
Avoidance of physical delivery securities;
(5)
Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members;
(6)
Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers; and
(7)
Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and third-party custodian.
(f)
Purchasing investments. Upon direction of the board of commissioners, a market trend analysis will be conducted to determine which maturities would be most advantageous prior to the purchase of any investment, based upon the projected cash flow requirements of the county. The county shall seek competitive investment/interest rates within its safety criteria.
(g)
Legal investment instruments. Investments (other than bond proceeds) shall be made in instruments permitted by the State of Georgia for local governments (O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4). Such instruments include:
(1)
Obligations issued by the U.S. government;
(2)
Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government or by a government agency of the United States;
(3)
Obligations of any corporation of the U.S. government;
(4)
Prime bankers' acceptances;
(5)
Repurchase agreements;
(6)
Obligations of other political subdivisions of the state; and
(7)
The Georgia local government investment pool (i.e., Georgia Fund.
In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-82-7, investments made with unexpended bond proceeds shall be limited to:
(1)
Bonds or obligations of the governmental entities and/or political subdivisions of the state;
(2)
Bonds or obligations of the U.S. government which are fully guaranteed;
(3)
Obligations of agencies of the U.S. government, bonds or other obligations of public housing agencies or municipal corporations in the United States;
(4)
Certificates of deposit of national or state banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
(5)
Certificates of deposit of Federal Saving and Loan Associations; and
(6)
The Georgia local government investment pool (Georgia Fund I).
(h)
Using the state of Georgia local government investment pool. The county will utilize the State of Georgia local government investment pool (e.g., Georgia Fund 1) anytime this investment tool is deemed to be in the best interest of the county. Criteria used to determine the use of this investment pool will be the same as any other investment purchase (O.C.G.A § 36-83-2).
(i)
Investment diversification. It is the policy of the county to diversify its investment portfolios. Assets held in the pooled funds and other investment funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from the over concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a specific issuer or a specific class of securities. In establishing diversification strategies, the following general policies and constraints shall apply:
(1)
Based upon the annual cash flow analysis, provisions shall be made for adequate liquidity of investments so that the county can efficiently and effectively meet, without financial penalty, disbursements and obligations. An appropriate placement of short-term (one year or less) and long-term (over one year) investments shall be made in accordance with operational needs.
The finance director shall establish strategies and guidelines for the percentage of total portfolios that may be invested in securities other than U.S. Treasury issues.
(j)
Investment maturities. Investments for all operating funds shall be made in maturities consistent with the estimated cash flow of the county. Both short-term (one year or less) and long-term (over one year) may be utilized in order to maximize investment return.
(k)
Reporting.
(1)
Methods. The finance director shall prepare an investment report at least quarterly, including a management summary that provides an analysis of the status of the current investment portfolio and transactions made over the last quarter. This management summary will be prepared in a manner which will allow the county to ascertain whether investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to the investment policy. The report should be provided to the finance director, the board of county commissioners, and any pool participants. The report will include the following:
a.
Listing of individual securities held at the end of the reporting period;
b.
Realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from appreciation or depreciation by listing the cost and market value of securities over one-year duration that are not intended to be held until maturity (in accordance with governmental accounting standards board (GASB) requirements);
c.
Average weighted yield to maturity of portfolio on investments as compared to applicable benchmarks;
d.
Listing of investment by maturity date; and
e.
Percentage of the total portfolio which each type of investment represents.
(2)
Performance standards. The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a market average rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. A series of appropriate benchmarks shall be established against which portfolio performance shall be compared on a regular basis.
(3)
Marking to market. The market value of the portfolio shall be calculated at least quarterly and a statement of the market value of the portfolio shall be issued at least quarterly. This will ensure that review of the investment portfolio, in terms of value and price volatility, has been performed consistent with the GFOA recommended practice on "Mark-to-Market Practices for State and Local Government Investment Portfolios and Investment Pools."

DIVISION 8. - TRAVEL

Sec. 2-435. - Travel.
This policy provides guidance for allowable county travel expenses. The county shall pay or reimburse employees who incur travel expenses while performing official duties for the county. All departments of the county including the constitutional officers are subject to these travel policies.
Employees may be reimbursed for reasonable travel related expenses incurred while on official business for the county. Subject to the provisions outlined in these travel policies, the board of county commissioners has authorized payment or reimbursement for the following expenses associated with employee travel:
(1)
Meals associated with overnight stays and in certain circumstances where there is no overnight stay;
(2)
Lodging expenses;
(3)
Mileage for use of a personal vehicle;
(4)
Transportation expenses, including parking and toll fees; and
(5)
Certain miscellaneous expenses associated with travel.
Situations may arise in the course of performing official job duties that may require employees to incur travel expenses that are generally not reimbursable. The county manager/supervising elected official is authorized to grant exceptions for unusual circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-436. - Definitions.

No travel costs will not be paid or reimbursed unless a travel request has been approved in advance. An employee travel expense form must be completed in their entirety before approval can be granted, and will be returned without consideration, until the form has been properly completed.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-438. - Meal allowance.
(a)
Overnight stays. Employees who are required to travel overnight will be reimbursed up to the maximum per day amount of $35.00 based upon the U.S. General Service Administration rates. This is designed to cover the cost of meals including taxes and tips. Meals will be reimbursed upon trip return, with required receipts. Employees traveling overnight are generally eligible for reimbursement amounts designed to cover the cost of three meals per day for all days on travel status including the day of departure and the day of return.
(1)
All receipts are required for payment of reimbursements, The county manager/supervising elected official is authorized to grant exceptions for unusual circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
(2)
No payment or reimbursements for alcoholic beverages will be allowed.
(3)
If extenuating circumstances exist and the employee on travel status does not have means to pay for meals prior to reimbursement from the county, the department head/supervising elected official may request the maximum amount $35.00 per day in advance of travel. The employee will be responsible for returning any amount to the county not documented by meal receipts.
(b)

Sec. 2-439. - Lodging.
Employees who travel more than 50 miles from their county office or residence may be reimbursed for lodging expenses associated with approved overnight travel. Employees will be reimbursed for the actual lodging expenses, provided the expenses are reasonable.
Lodging may be reserved using a county credit card but must be paid by a county check or county credit card so the county can be exempt from state sales tax and local hotel/motel tax. Required hotel tax exempt and sales tax exempt forms shall be used, and are available in the board of commissioners' office.
(1)
If an employee uses a personal credit card, check, or cash to pay for lodging expenses within Georgia, the employee will be responsible for the state sales tax and the local hotel/motel tax and will not be reimbursed for those taxes. The county manager/supervising elected official is authorized to grant exceptions for unusual circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
Lodging shall be paid or reimbursed at the single-room rate, and in cases where the event is being held at a particular hotel or similar facility, the lodging paid or reimbursed shall not exceed the single-room rate at that facility. If an employee chooses accommodations elsewhere, the lodging shall be paid or reimbursed at a rate not to exceed the single-room rate at the hotel where the event is being held.
In cases where numerous hotels are approved by the organization holding the event, then lodging shall be paid or reimbursed at a rate not to exceed the highest single-room rate for the hotels on the approved list.
Family members are not prohibited from lodging with employees but in no case will expenses directly attributable to family members be paid or reimbursed.
Prior to travel within Georgia, the employee will be responsible for obtaining proper payment authorization and a county check for the proper lodging amount excluding the state sales tax and the local hotel/motel tax. In addition to the county check, the employee will also be responsible for obtaining a sales tax exemption form and a hotel/motel tax exemption form from the finance department so the county can be exempt from paying the state sales tax and the local hotel/motel tax as a lodging expense (O.C.G.A. § 48-13-51). Upon check-in, the employee will submit these forms to the hotel/motel clerk. Upon check-out, the employee will confirm that the final lodging bill does not include the state sales tax and the local hotel/motel tax. All applicable taxes for lodging outside Georgia will be paid or reimbursed. The county will not reimburse for in-room movies.
If lodging is reserved for an employee, and that employee is for some reason unable to use the lodging, a reasonable effort must be made by the employee to cancel the reservation so that county is not billed or penalized as a result. All expenses related to cancellation of lodging shall be borne by the employee unless otherwise approved by the county manager, and in no case may the room be paid or reimbursed by the county for the exclusive use of someone other than the approved employee.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-440. - Travel by commercial or public transportation.
When commercial transportation is necessary, employees may use the county's credit card or be reimbursed for the expenses incurred. Employees will be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred, provided the appropriate steps were taken to obtain the lowest possible fare or cost. Travel by commercial or public transportation must be approved by authorized department personnel prior to the date of travel. When considering such a request, department personnel should consider the distance to be traveled, the travel time, and the cost.
(1)
Commercial air transportation. Employees should utilize commercial air transportation when it is more cost effective and efficient to travel by air rather than by vehicle. Employees who require air travel should obtain the lowest available airfare to the specified destination, which may include the use of the Internet or a travel agency.
Employees should use electronic ticketing to avoid any surcharge associated with hardcopy tickets.
Many travel agencies now charge small fees for issuing tickets. These fees, if reasonable, are part of the cost of travel. Employees may, therefore, be reimbursed for such costs.
In general, it is the county's policy that employees traveling by commercial air carrier travel in the most cost-effective manner with the advance purchase of tickets, if possible, to obtain the lowest available coach fares. Employees traveling by commercial air carrier will not be reimbursed for the portion of non-coach (i.e. first class, business class, etc.) airfare that exceeds the cost of the lowest, available fare.
Occasions may arise when airlines overbook, change, delay or cancel flights, thereby imposing travel inconveniences on their passengers. In these instances, airlines often offer the impacted passengers indemnification for these inconveniences. Examples of indemnification that may be offered by an airline include vouchers for meals or lodging, upgrades to non-coach travel, and credits toward future flight costs. Employees are authorized to accept such indemnification if the travel inconvenience was imposed by the airline and there is no additional cost to the county.
Under certain circumstances, state and federal agencies may reimburse the county for expenses incurred for air travel, provided these expenses were approved prior to the date of travel.
NOTE: Employees who choose to travel by personal vehicle when air travel is more cost effective will only be reimbursed for the cost of the lowest available airfare to the specified destination.
(2)
Travel by county owned vehicle, personal vehicle, or rental vehicle. Employees traveling outside the county may use a county owned vehicle, if available, or their personal vehicle, or a rental vehicle. In cases in which multiple employees travel to the same event, every effort should be made to share transportation when reasonably possible.
County owned vehicle means an employee may use a county owned vehicle and a county credit card for fuel purchases or they may be reimbursed by submitting appropriate receipts for fuel purchases. Family members are prohibited from traveling in a county owned vehicle.
Personal vehicle means an employee may use a personal vehicle and be reimbursed according to the current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standard mileage rate in effect at the time of travel. Mileage must be documented using odometer readings from the personal vehicle or from a website used for directions and maps, and must be reasonable given the context of the trip.
Rental vehicle means an employee's use of a commercially rented vehicle will be left to the discretion of the county manager and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The county's credit card can be used to reserve and pay for a rental vehicle or the employee can be reimbursed for the actual rental expenses. Employees traveling on county business in a rented vehicle are covered by the county's liability policy; therefore, liability coverage should be declined when renting a vehicle. Employees requiring the use of a commercially rented vehicle will be reimbursed for gasoline purchases associated with the business use of such vehicle, provided appropriate receipts are submitted. The county will only reimburse economy class rental rates.
(3)
Travel by mass transportation, taxi, or airport vans. Employees officially on travel status may be reimbursed for necessary costs of transportation by bus, taxi, or airport vans for the following situations:
1.
Between the employee's departure point and the common carrier's departure point;
2.
Between the common carrier's arrival point and the employee's lodging or meeting place; and
3.
Between the lodging and meeting places if at different locations.
It is expected that airport vans will be utilized when available and practical, and when they are the lowest cost alternative.
(4)
Required documentation of expenses. All travel by rented or public transportation must be recorded on the employee travel expense statement. Employees requesting reimbursement must submit receipts for travel by commercial air carrier and for the cost of rented vehicles, including the cost of gasoline purchased. When requesting reimbursement for airfare, the employee must attach a receipt from the airline which includes the itinerary and the amount paid.
Although receipts are recommended, employees are not required to submit receipts for travel by mass transportation, taxi, or airport vans. However, a point-to-point explanation is required for each item reimbursed. All transportation expenses should be itemized on the employee travel expense statement.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-441. - Miscellaneous.
Employees may be reimbursed for expenses incurred for work related telephone, fax messages, and other business services when traveling. Employees must document these expenses on the travel expense statement, and indicate the location from which each call was made, the person contacted, and the reason for the communication.
Employees may be reimbursed for reasonable travel related expenses including parking fees at airport and hotels, tips, toll fees, and fees associated with baggage handling services (when an expense is actually incurred in moving luggage into or out of lodging places, common carriers, and/or airports.
The board of county commissioners is allowed an expense account for meals, lodging, and transportation for the purpose of conducting county business.

Sec. 2-450. - Grants.
Grant funds available from state and federal sources may be used for county operated programs or may be pass-through funds for local agencies or organizations.
The granting agencies, state and federal law, and generally accepted accounting principles impose specific requirements for the proper accounting and reporting of grant revenues and expenditures. Therefore, the finance department must be informed of grants applied for and awarded to the county to assure that accounting procedures are in place to allow expenditure and receipt of grant funds.
(Res. No. 2020-16, 12-15-20)
Sec. 2-451. - White County grant policy and procedures.
(a)
Grant opportunity. A grant opportunity can be initiated by the board of commissioners, county manager, constitutional officer, department head, or any person within a department that locates or is notified of a funding opportunity.
(b)
Departmental review. The department should review and approve the funding possibility. Any commitment (i.e., matching funds, restrictions on use of property, required policies, etc.) from the county should be evaluated. This review should include department head support and sign-off as well as concurrence from any other department affected by the funding.
(c)
County manager notification.
(1)
The county manager should be notified of the grant and application intentions. This is also the time in the process to identify match funding. In some cases, especially foundation submissions, special attention must be made to avoid repetitive grant requests from multiple departments.
(2)
DUNS number. As of October of 2003, federal grants now require applicants to fill out a DUNS number on grant applications.
a.
The White County Government should be consistent and use the same DUNS number on all applications registered with D&B for DUNS numbers.
b.
The DUNS number that is used should reflect the location and name of chief executive officer (commission chairman) for all financials for one accounting location.
c.
To avoid confusion and multiple records and ratings, everyone in the county should use the same DUNS number in the future. The White County Government DUNS number is 07-2476773.
(3)
Certifications and assurances. Departments should review grant applications to determine that White County meets all certifications and assurances that are required with the performance of the grant and can adhere to all certifications and assurances during the life of the grant.
(4)
Pass thru grants. Procedures for pass thru grants are the same as regular grants. However, a subrecipient agreement between the county and all sub-recipients is required for all pass thru grant recipients. The county attorney can compose the subrecipient agreement.

(g)
Grant post award process.
(1)
The finance department will need the approved acceptance agenda item and notification from the funding agency to set up the grant budget in the system. The finance director should have copies of everything essential to the grant from start to finish, including acceptance documents signed by the chairman. Departments must verify that expenses are approved and allowable under the grant guidelines.
(2)
All copies of pertinent documents for the grant (the application, contract and special conditions) should be forwarded to the finance director.
a.
Be aware of grant requirements. The "special conditions" as outlined by the funding source should be followed and copied to finance.
b.
Grant fund origins (state or federal agencies) need to be identified so they can be included in the county's annual comprehensive financial report (audit).
c.
The finance department requires the funding agency contact person information for your grant.
d.
In addition, the finance director will need any financial reports (reimbursement requests and/or monthly reports) that the county is required to complete and return to the funding agency. It is especially important that the finance department receive a copy of any payment request the department submits to the funding agency. This is of great benefit to the finance department in tracking payments as they are received.

Once a grant has been awarded, the department head or designee will meet with the finance director.

Grant performance is subject to review at the county level through the annual single audit, and through various reviews conducted by the funding agencies.

Our performance with a grant, whether good or bad, can impact our ability to receive future grants.
