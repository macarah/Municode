ARTICLE III. - RAW WOOD WASTE PROCESSING/RECYCLING STORAGE AND OPERATIONS

Sec. 38-71. - General.
Scope. The storage and processing of wood chips, hogged material, fines, compost, mulch and raw products in association with yard waste and recycling facilities located within Forsyth County shall be in accordance with the Forsyth County Ordinance and the International Fire Code.
Purpose. This standard shall provide guidelines for raw wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations. Wood chipping, hogging, composting and mulching operations and storage create a significant fire hazard and are rated as a very high hazard based on the "Heat of Output" Btu per pound of product.
While generally more difficult to ignite than usual class A combustibles such as paper and cardboard, after being ignited the spread of fire and smoke can be rapid and deepseated. The larger the storage of raw wood products, the greater the fire hazard and the more difficult a fire is to control. Wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations shall comply with this standard.
Responsibility. All individuals and companies who engage or intend to engage in the storage, processing or handling of compost, mulch and organic materials shall comply with the requirement of the Forsyth County Fire Department and this standard.
Permit required. A permit shall be obtained from the fire department prior to engaging in the storing or processing of wood chips, hogged material, fines, compost and raw product in association with yard waste and similar material recycling facilities. The permit shall be renewed on an annual basis, or shall be limited to such period of time as designated by the Fire Code official. Permits shall not be transferable and any change in use, location, occupancy, operation, or ownership shall require a new permit.
Permit Office contact information for wood products and/or waste handling is as follows:
The Forsyth County Bureau of Fire Prevention

Facility site plans shall include fire department access roads throughout, area division of piles, pile height and width, and all exposures. A copy of the facility site plan shall be maintained on-site.
(b)
Operational and emergency plans. The following operational and emergency action plans shall be submitted to and be approved by the fire code official prior to initiating operation.
(1)
Operational plan. At a minimum, the operational plan must include site layout, pile dimensions, fire access, water supply, site security, site operations, temperature monitoring, rotation, and diversion plan.
(2)
Emergency plan. Emergency plans shall include the facility operator's fire response actions, designated fire dispersal areas, equipment operators call back number, and initiation of incoming diversion plan. Emergency plans shall define the equipment necessary to process and handle the materials. All fires shall be reported to the fire department immediately upon discovery by calling 911.
(c)
Equipment operator emergency callback plan. The operator shall implement and maintain a plan for rapid equipment operator response to the site. The maximum response time to the site for the equipment operator shall be within one hour of notification. The following equipment shall be on site: bulldozer, loaders, and heavy-duty equipment necessary to mitigate a fire. Skilled operators shall be available pursuant to an approved emergency callback plan. Notification procedure shall be maintained operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Notification may be by pager activation or telephone answering service or other approved means.
(d)
Incoming waste diversion plan. The operator shall develop and submit a diversion plan for incoming green waste for implementation in the event of equipment failure or other inability to process and distribute green waste. The plan shall prevent stockpiling of waste on the site and unauthorized depositing of waste on or near the site. The operator shall initiate the diversion based on criteria in the Operational and Emergency Plan without further direction from the fire department.
Non-processable or non-green waste material. All green waste that cannot be processed on-site, such as stumps and fibrous plants, shall be immediately removed from the feedstock, stored in roll-off containers or bins and removed from the facility no less frequently than on a weekly basis. All plastic bags shall be removed prior to shredding material.
Combustible vegetation control. The operator shall clear any combustible material, weeds, brush, trees or other vegetation (including mulch) that is, or could become, dry and could be capable of transmitting fire, from within 50 feet of raw green waste and mulch piles. Clearance shall be to bare earth or other surface approved by the Fire Code Official. Individual growing trees within that distance may remain with approval of the Fire Code official.
Pile separation: Piles subject to this article shall be separated from adjacent piles and property lines by fire department access roadways.
Static pile protection. Interior pile temperatures of piles subject to this ordinance shall be monitored and recorded on a regular basis per the operational plan. Internal pile temperatures must be taken at two-thirds the pile height, 12 to 24 inches from the surface with a probe-type thermometer. Readings shall be made at not greater than 50-foot intervals along the length of the pile.
Once windrows exceed 158 degrees F, the operator must institute reasonable measures to prevent internal temperatures from continuing to rise.
Once windrows exceed 170 degrees F, the windrows must be reduced in size, be rotated, and be monitored daily until temperatures drop below 158 degrees F. All green waste stockpiles shall be re-mixed as necessary to alleviate any fire due to spontaneous combustion or temperatures above 170 degrees F°.
Windrows shall be visually inspected on a weekly basis. Once fires have been detected in any windrows at a site, this visual inspection shall be a minimum daily requirement. Daily inspections shall continue until the threat of fire no longer exists, and the Fire Code official approves suspension.
All temperature and pile-handling records shall be kept on file at the site and be made available for inspection by fire department personnel. Data shall include date, time, temperature, specific location, and person conducting measurement.
Time limits for processing. All combustible material stored by a facility to produce mulch or compost must be ground so that 100 percent has a particle size of six inches or less in at least one dimension and 90 percent has a particle size of six inches or less in all dimensions no later than 90 days after receipt. Material will not be considered processed until it is ground to the specified dimensions.
Site identification. Facility name and address shall be posted at main entrance and clearly visible from the street. A 24-hour emergency contact telephone number shall be posted at the main entrance and clearly visible from the street.
Security. A fence of at least six feet in height of non-combustible material or other suitable means to prevent access of any unauthorized persons shall surround the entire property.
