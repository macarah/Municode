Sec. 10-12. - Nonconforming uses.
modified
The lawful use, size, or location of a building or structure or the type of activity now being conducted in a building existing at the original effective date of this chapter (i.e., May 18, 1970) shall not be affected by this chapter, although such use, size, location or type of activity does not conform to the provisions of this chapter; but no such use shall be extended to occupy any portion of the building not presently so occupied nor to any land outside such buildings. Except as required by law, there shall he no structural alterations on premises devoted to a nonconforming use, until such structural alterations have been specifically authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals after receipt of the recommendation of the Municipal Planning Commission. If such nonconforming building or structure is removed or the nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a period of time exceeding one hundred (100) consecutive days, every future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. No signs visible from the exterior in connection with a nonconforming use shall be constructed except for those lettered upon windows of the building.
Nonconforming buildings or structures may not be enlarged in any respect.
Except as herein provided, no building or structure shall be erected or altered, nor shall any building or structure or premises be used for any purpose other than is permitted in the district [in which] such building, structure or premises is located. The lawful use of land existing at the original effective date of this chapter (i.e., May 18, 1970), although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, shall not be affected by this chapter; provided, however, that no such nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy a greater area of land. If such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of not less than one hundred (100) days, any future use of land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that where land is now used for a use excluded from the district in which such land is located, and such use is not accessory to the use of a main building located on the same lot or grounds, such nonconforming use of land shall be discontinued, and all material incident to such nonconforming use shall be completely removed by its owner not later than thirty (30) days from the passage of this chapter.
The provisions of this chapter are not to be considered as making lawful any use of buildings, structures or lands which had heretofore been forbidden by ordinance or law, nor as enlarging upon or varying the nonconforming use heretofore permitted under the provisions of any prior or existing law or ordinance.
Nothing in this chapter shall be taken to prevent the restoration and continued occupancy of a building or structure destroyed to the extent of not more than fifty percent (50%) by fire, explosion or other casualty, or act of God, or the public enemy, provided that such restoration be commenced within four (4) months of such destruction.
In the event any nonconforming building or structure shall, in the judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals, become so dilapidated as to be dangerous to public health, safety or welfare, such nonconforming use may thereupon be ordered by said Board to be discontinued. Commencing thirty (30) days after written notification to such effect to the owner of such building or structure and any occupants, such nonconforming use shall become illegal, and no alteration or restoration shall have the effect of allowing resumption of such nonconforming use, regardless of whether such alteration or restoration is voluntary or in obedience to instructions of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Any provision of the ordinances of the City of Lookout Mountain to the contrary notwithstanding, mobile homes, trailer courts, camp grounds, amusement rides (as that term is defined in Official Code of Georgia Annotated § 34-12-2(2) (1992) [O.C.G.A. § 34-12-2(2)]), carnival rides (as that term is defined in Official Code of Georgia Annotated § 34-13-2(3) (1992) [O.C.G.A. § 34-13-2(3)]), other mechanical rides, go cart tracks, batting cages, chair lifts, sky lifts, water slides, wave pools, alpine slides, outdoor amphitheaters and other outdoor theaters, bungee jumping towers, observation towers, zoos and animal parks, pawn shops, tattoo parlors and shops, cigar and smoke shops, vape shops, and game and amusement arcades are specifically designated herein as being nonconforming uses within all districts or zones of the City of Lookout Mountain and are specifically prohibited in all such districts or zones.

Any such required screening and foliage cover shall be placed and located solely within the property where the fence is erected or placed, but may be rooted on either the inside or the outside of the fence, so long as the outside of the fence has the required cover and screening.
(H)
Existing Fences. The lawful use, size or location of a fence existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance shall not be affected by this Ordinance although such existing fence may not conform to or comply with the provisions hereof; provided, however, that such fences shall be maintained in good repair and condition as provided in this Ordinance, and no such fence shall be extended, enlarged or replaced except in full conformity and compliance with the terms hereof.
(I)
Municipal Planning Commission Approval.
(1)
Applications for permits to erect or place fences, walls, screens or fence-like garden structures within the City of Lookout Mountain must be made in writing to the Municipal Planning Commission. The Commission may require as a condition to considering the application such plans, drawings, photographs, maps, manufacturers' brochures and other data as it may deem material and may conduct such investigations and inquiries as it may deem necessary or expedient. All such plans, drawings, etc., shall be submitted to the Commission at least ten (10) calendar days before the meeting at which the application is to be considered. The applicant shall have the burden of showing to the satisfaction of the Commission that the proposed fence will not adversely affect motor vehicle and traffic safety, accessibility to buildings on the property in the event of fire or other emergency, police protection, accessibility for garbage and leaf service, the natural beauty of the neighborhood, and scenic views. The Commission may also consider such factors as objections of other persons in the neighborhood, the extent that adjacent and neighboring yards are open, and such other practical and aesthetic factors deemed material by the Commission.
(2)
Except for the fences and other structures authorized by the limited exceptions set forth in Section 10-19(B) of this Ordinance, any fence, wall, screen or fence-like garden structure erected without the prior approval of the Municipal Planning Commission may be ordered removed by the City Building Official or the Municipal Planning Commission; provided, however, that if the property owner proves to the Commission that an illegally erected fence is in full compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance and pays a building permit fee twice the amount of the fee that would have otherwise been charged for the fence, the Commission may, in its discretion, allow the fence to remain.
(3)
If a property owner fails to remove an illegally erected fence, wall, screen, or fence-like garden structure within thirty (30) days of notification from the City Building Official or Municipal Planning Commission, the City may, at its option, remove the fence at the property owner's expense. The cost of such removal shall constitute a lien on the property and may be collected by levy and sale of the property or by any other lawful means.
(4)
In the event any property owner or other interested party is aggrieved by any decision of the Commission either granting or denying an application for the approval of a fence, or by any other action of the City Building Official or Municipal Planning Commission under this Ordinance, he may, within but no later than ten (10) days after such decision, petition the City Council in writing for a hearing, and the action of the City Council by resolution of a majority of the Council at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be final and binding upon the property owner or other interested party.

ARTICLE V. - INTERPRETATION, AMENDMENT

Sec. 10-20. - Interpretation, purpose and conflict.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, the chapter shall be held to contain the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this chapter to limit, abrogate, or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings, structures or premises or upon the height of buildings or structures, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
Sec. 10-20.1. - Amendments of chapter—Initiation.
The City Council may from time to time, after report thereon by the Municipal Planning Commission and after public hearing as required by law, amend, supplement or change the number, shape or boundaries of districts or any regulations or provisions of this chapter. Any such change may be initiated by the City Council, the Municipal Planning Commission, or by petition of the owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the frontage within a given area. When initiated by the City Council, such change shall be referred to the Municipal Planning Commission for investigation and report as provided by the next section. Whenever an owner of property desires a change in classification thereof or a change in the regulations applying thereto, such owner shall present to the Municipal Planning Commission a petition duly signed and acknowledged by him, requesting such changes. No such change initiated or requested by the property owner may be considered unless all ad valorem taxes and any other taxes or charges owing either to the City of Lookout Mountain or to Walker County with respect to the property are current. Before the City Council or the Municipal Planning Commission considers any such change in the classification of the property or the regulations applying thereto, the City Council and/or Municipal Planning Commission may require the property owner to provide written verification from the City of Lookout Mountain and/or Walker County that all taxes, interest, penalties, attorney fees and other charges due and owing with respect to the property have been paid in full.
As used in this Section 10-20.1, the words "amend," "change" or "supplement" include the request for a change, or other proceeding to provide new or different uses, regulations or conditions with respect to the classification, zoning or use of any property.
Sec. 10-20.2. - Same—Public hearing.
Public hearings relating to any such change shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended) and shall, at a minimum, include all notice and hearing requirements now or hereafter established by Georgia law, including, but not limited to, the notice and hearing requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 36-66-1, et seq. [O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.]
Sec. 10-20.3. - Same—Standards.
The standards governing the exercise of the zoning power of the City of Lookout Mountain are as set forth in the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended). Those standards govern all "Zoning Decisions" as that term is defined in the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, including, but not limited to, amendments to the City of Lookout Mountain's zoning ordinances.
Sec. 10-20.4. - Same—Fees for administrative costs.
Fees for the processing of proposed amendments to this chapter or to any other zoning ordinance shall be set from time to time by the City Council and charged in accordance with the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended).
Sec. 10-20.5. - Same—Incorporation of amendments into Charter.
The phrase used in this chapter "at the effective date of this chapter" shall in its application to land, buildings, structures, properties and uses affected by an amendment to this chapter be read to mean "at the effective date of" the amendment containing regulations or provisions with respect to such land, buildings, structures, properties and uses.
Sec. 10-21. - Enforcement, violations and penalties.
Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and shall be punished in accordance with Section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances of the City. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
It shall constitute a violation of this chapter for any person, firm or corporation, either owner or agent, to do any of the things prohibited by this chapter, including, without limitation, doing anything that can be done only pursuant to a permit, without having first obtained the permit therefor required hereby; and if any permit is issued upon a false statement of any fact which is material to the issuance thereof (established to the satisfaction of the Building Official), he shall forthwith revoke the same by notice in writing to be delivered by him to the holder of the permit upon the premises with respect to which the violation has occurred, or, if such holder is not found there, by posting the said notice of revocation in some conspicuous place upon such premises. Notice of such revocation shall also be given in writing by registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last-known address of the person complained of. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with such work or use with respect to which the permit has been revoked, without having obtained a new and additional permit in accordance with this chapter, shall he deemed guilty of violation hereof.
In case any violations are discovered, the Building Official shall refer such violations to the City Council for appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or remove such violation, or the execution of work thereon, or to restrain or correct the erection or alteration of, or to require the removal of, or to prevent the occupation or use of, the building or structure erected, constructed or altered in violation of, or not in compliance with, the provisions of this chapter or with respect to which the requirements thereof, or of any order or direction made pursuant to provisions contained therein, shall not have been complied with.
Whenever, in the opinion of the Building Official, by reason of illegal work in violation of a provision or requirement of this chapter, the continuation of a building or structure operation is contrary to public welfare, he shall also refer such violation to the City Council. The Council shall thereupon order, in writing, all further work of such nature to be stopped, and may require suspension of all work on the property until the condition in violation has been corrected.
The provision herein for penalties and other methods of enforcement shall not preclude the City Council, City Attorney or other proper prosecuting authority from instituting and prosecuting an appropriate action or proceeding to prevent any unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, or to restrain, correct or abate any violation, or to prevent the occupancy of any building, structure, or premises, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about any premises.
