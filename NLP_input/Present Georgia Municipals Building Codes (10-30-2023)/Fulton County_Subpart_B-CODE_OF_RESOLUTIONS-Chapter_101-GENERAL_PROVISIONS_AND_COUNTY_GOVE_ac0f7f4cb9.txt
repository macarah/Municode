Sec. 101-2. - Definitions and rules of construction.
The following definitions and rules of construction shall apply to all resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners, unless the context requires otherwise:
Generally. Ordinary meanings shall be applied to all words, except words of art, or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter, in which case words shall have the significance attached to them by experts in such trade or with reference to such subject matter. The definitions of terms found in generally accepted dictionaries are prima facie evidence of meaning. In making interpretations of resolutions, the courts shall look diligently for the intent of the board of commissioners, as gleaned from the minutes of meetings reflecting the approval of motions by the board of commissioners, recitals found in ordinances, and statements of policy and intent adopted by the board of commissioners. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands.
Liberal construction; minimum requirements; overlapping provisions. All general provisions, terms, phrases, and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the board of commissioners may be fully carried out. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, such provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the other provisions of this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling.
Captions, maps, etc. In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Code and any caption, illustration, map, chart, summary table or illustrative table, the text shall control.

State Law reference— Exemptions from open meeting requirements, O.C.G.A. § 50-14-3.
Sec. 101-63. - Presiding officer and rules for debate.
(a)
Generally. In accordance with the Fulton County Code of Laws, the chair of the board of commissioners is responsible for the orderly conduct of the board during the meeting and serves as the presiding officer. In order to ensure a fair, orderly, and efficient meeting, the chair must enforce the rules of procedure adopted by the board. In the absence of the chair, the vice-chair shall preside. Where a quorum is present and neither the chair or vice-chair is present, the board may designate an acting presiding officer. Meetings are conducted in accordance with these procedural rules, applicable state law, and Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. Where a commissioner raises a procedural question and these rules are silent, and in the absence of a specific statute, ordinance, or resolution, the question shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, so long as the provision used to answer the question is not in violation of local, state or federal laws.
(b)
Debate. All resolutions, contracts, and items of business which require board approval prior to the expenditure of funds, as well as any other item which requires board action, shall be acted upon by the board only after a commissioner makes a motion and receives a second to the motion. A motion and proper second is recorded by the clerk. Each commissioner, by virtue of his/her election to the board, has the right and obligation to debate any and all issues which come before the board for consideration. However, to ensure an orderly and efficient meeting, each commissioner shall observe the following rules in regards to debate:
(1)
The chair, as presiding officer (or vice-chair in the chair's absence), shall call for discussion on an item. No debate on an item should begin until the item has been sounded by the clerk to the commission (the clerk), or in the clerk's absence, the chief deputy clerk.
(2)
Once the item has been properly moved and seconded, the chair shall call for discussion.
(3)
Thereafter, the chair shall open debate by recognizing each commissioner who wishes to speak for a period not to exceed ten total minutes, with the additional stipulation that no commissioner shall hold the floor for more than five consecutive minutes of their allotted time. However, at the opening of each board meeting, a commissioner may ask their colleagues to waive the normal time limits on issues they deem need more time. The board will vote on each request before the agenda begins and decide among themselves what additional amount of time to allot to each commissioner. The developmental services director or the board's designee shall be the official timekeeper for the board.
(4)
If a commissioner believes that debate on an issue is too lengthy or that a vote should be called for immediately on an issue, he or she can "call the question" or "move the previous question." This motion is out of order if it is made while another commissioner has the floor or if the maker of the motion is not recognized by the chair. This is a motion that is not debatable and requires a second. Once the motion has been properly made and seconded, the chair shall immediately stop debate on the issue being debated and announce that there is a call the question motion on the floor. Immediately thereafter, the chair shall call for a vote on the call the question motion, not on the main motion. If the call the question motion fails, debate on the issue may continue, and then the chair may allow debate on the issue to resume. If it passes, the chair must immediately call for a vote on the issue which was the subject of the call the question motion.
(5)
Any action by the board, including final action on applications for changes in land use status, but excluding a reconsideration of any action previously considered, i.e., motions to adjourn, motions to suspend the rules, an affirmative vote to lay on the table, or to take from the table, shall be subject to a motion to reconsider. After a motion to reconsider is made, a motion to rescind must also be made. After the motion to rescind is made, the matter would be appropriate for an additional passed motion and discussion thereon. Such motions can only be made by a member of the prevailing side on the original action. A motion to reconsider may be made immediately after it fails to prevail but in no case can it be made any later than the next scheduled board of commissioners meeting. A motion to reconsider is debatable only if the action being reconsidered is debatable. Upon passage of a motion to reconsider, the subject matter shall be considered anew without regard to previous board action. No reconsideration can be made on a zoning request at a subsequent meeting.
(6)
Any zoning matter which is deferred or on which discussion is otherwise postponed by the board shall be heard at the next appropriate scheduled zoning meeting. Zoning matters are heard only on the first meeting of the month, in accordance with a schedule set by the director of developmental services. Ordinarily, no new zoning cases are heard in January.
(93-RC-701, Rule 3, 1-5-94)
Sec. 101-64. - Quorum.
A quorum must be present for the transaction of business of the board. In accordance with the Georgia law, four of the seven elected commissioners must be present to constitute a quorum. It is the duty of the chair to enforce this rule. Any commissioner may raise a point of order if that commissioner believes that a quorum is not present. If during the course of a meeting a quorum is lost, the board cannot transact business. If, however, members of the board are in the commissioners' conference room adjacent to the assembly hall and are able to hear the business of the board through the public address system, the board has not lost a quorum. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the chair must adjourn the meeting.
(93-RC-701, Rule 4, 1-5-94)
Sec. 101-65. - Voting.
Four members of the board of commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The affirmative vote of at least four members shall be required for said board of commissioners to take official action. Each commissioner shall record his or her vote by using the voting machine and should not vote by voice or by requesting that the clerk's staff manually record their vote.
(93-RC-701, Rule 5, 1-5-94)
Sec. 101-66. - Agenda, preparation of; public comment.
(a)
The Fulton County Board of Commissioners holds a regular meeting (first Wednesday of the month) and a recess meeting (third Wednesday of the month). The agenda is prepared by the clerk's office in concert with the county manager's office. The deadline for submitting items for regularly scheduled board of commissioners' meetings to the clerk's office for inclusion on the next agenda is 10:00 a.m. on Friday prior to the meeting. A final copy of the agenda is distributed to the commissioners, county attorney, county manager and appropriate staff by 2:00 p.m. on the Friday preceding the scheduled meeting of the board. Copies are also made available to the public at that time. A post agenda is provided after the meeting. The post agenda is a precursor to the final minutes and reflects actions taken by the board at a particular meeting. Post agendas/preliminary minutes are distributed by the clerk's office within 48 hours of a meeting.
(b)
The agenda preparation procedure is as follows:
(1)
Any commissioner wishing to place an item on the agenda may do so and should submit a memorandum to the clerk stating the item to be placed on the agenda. Any supporting documents germane to the item should also be submitted.
(2)
Adding of items to the agenda during the meeting is disfavored. Where there is a showing of an emergency or extraordinary circumstances exist, an item may be added to the agenda when it is separately voted on and is adopted during the meeting by a supermajority of the board of commissioners. A motion shall be properly made and must carry to add each item to the agenda on the day of the meeting. That item shall appear on the post agenda under the "added during the meeting" heading.
(3)
During the public comment portion of a board meeting, citizens may voice county related requests, concerns, opinions, etc. At the regular meeting, speakers will be heard prior to the zoning portion of the agenda; if applicable, at the recess meeting, prior to the county manager's unfinished business. Before speaking, each speaker presenting in person must fill out a speaker card, located at the assembly hall entrance and podium. All speaker cards must be submitted to the clerk's staff, prior to the commencement of public comment, who will accept them on a first-come, first served basis. The meeting will be aired live on all official Fulton County Government media platforms as designated by the Fulton County Department of External Affairs. Speakers wishing to submit public comment to the board in writing can do so by submitting their comments in all forms deemed allowable by the Fulton County Department of External Affairs. To be read into the record, written comments must be received by 5:00 p.m. on the Tuesday, immediately prior to the meeting in the form outlined. All virtual public comments and requests to speak in person must be submitted before the clerk sounds the start of the meeting.
a.
Speakers who cannot be present at assembly hall may speak live or via videoconference (ex. Zoom). Speakers can also speak live from other county facilities made available, such as the North Fulton Service Center or the South Fulton Service Center.
b.
Comments via e-mail shall be provided electronically to the BOC and their staff before the meeting begins and all comments shall be included as part of the minutes of the board of commissioners meeting.
c.
Comments via e-mail that are the same in nature or pertain to the same BOC agenda item number shall be categorized by county staff ahead of the meeting. To expedite time, for e-mailed public comments that are the same in nature or pertain to the same BOC agenda item number or subject matter/topic, the clerk or other assigned staff shall read the agenda item number and/or topic, and then read the list of public commenters' names and locations (if given) that are in support of the item; then read the list of public commenters' names and locations (if given) who oppose the agenda item or topic. This rule shall apply to all forms of pre-written/pre-recorded public comment.
d.
Public comment will occur prior to the business portion of the BOC meeting and will be strictly limited to 30 minutes. In-person comments will be made first, followed by written/emailed comments. Regardless of the form of the public comment (spoken/written) the time limit will be two minutes, and no time shall be yielded to other speakers. Priority for public comment will be given to Fulton County citizens and those individuals representing businesses or organizations located within Fulton County, including their employees, whether such persons are commenting in-person, via emails or via Zoom or other electronic media (i.e., phone call). Non-Fulton County citizens will only be heard after all in-person Fulton County citizens, representatives of business and organizations located within Fulton County, including their employees have been heard and the time allotted for public comment has not expired, except as otherwise provided in this code section. County staff shall verify the residency of each public speaker prior to such person being heard by the board.
e.
In the event the 30-minute time limit is reached prior to public comments being completed, public comment will be suspended and the business portion of the BOC meeting will commence. Public comment will resume at the end of the meeting. Similarly, written comments (that were timely submitted) not previously read, may be read at the end of the meeting.
f.
Speaker cards will provide three options for those individuals who want to speak that were not able to comment during the initial 30-minute public comment time limit:
1.
Speak at the end of the meeting;
2.
Be placed at the front of the line for public comment at the next meeting; or
3.
Provide written comment that will be read at the end of the BOC meeting.
g.
In the event that none of these three options are selected, the individual will forfeit their right to public comment for that day.
NOTE: If the subject matter involves an issue to be resolved, the citizen should first contact the county manager's office, which will ensure that the relevant department heads and other individuals are contacted to rectify the matter. If the issue cannot be resolved through the county manager's efforts, the citizen may then contact a commissioner so that the matter can be placed on a board meeting agenda. The commissioner should then inform the clerk by memorandum stating the subject to be discussed and the citizen who will speak.
The address and phone number of the citizen should be conveyed. Any supporting material germane to the issue should also be submitted.
(4)
Whenever any agenda item, via resolution, seeks board approval of a written agreement, a copy of the written agreement shall be attached to the agenda item or resolution and shall be distributed by the clerk as with other agenda items. Upon approval of the item, the clerk shall include a copy of the written agreement in the official minutes of the board meeting at which such approval occurred.
(c)
Once the agenda has been approved in the meeting, it takes four affirmative votes to remove county manager items. If the county manager decides to remove an item from the agenda, he/she should suggest removal from the agenda by submitting a request in writing to the clerk who will announce it during the adoption of the agenda. Four votes are required for approval. The county manager should be prepared to state his/her reason for removal. Commissioners can remove their items at any time and this action does not require board approval. The board enacted a "Three Meeting Held Rule" that gives the clerk the authority to remove commissioners' items that have been on the agenda for three meetings. The clerk shall further have authority to remove commissioners' items that have previously been determined by the board of commissioners to be matters reserved for discussion in executive session.

Sec. 101-69. - Public hearings and participation.
(a)
In accordance with law and policy, the board frequently conducts public hearings on a number of matters and issues. These public hearing rules are intended to ensure that the public has the opportunity to fairly participate in the meeting while promoting the orderly, efficient, and effective flow of the meeting.
(b)
Rules for conducting public hearings are as follows:
(1)
The chair shall announce that the public hearing on a matter is now open and should call forth those persons who wish to speak in favor, against, or otherwise on the particular issue. The chair shall inform the public that all comments by proponents, opponents, or the public shall be made from the podium and that any individual making a comment should first give their name and address. The chair shall also inform the public that comments will only be received from the podium.
(2)
Members of the public who wish to speak should complete a speaker's card and should hand it to a representative of the clerk's office. Members of the public are expected to adhere to the rules of decorum outlined herein and should be informed of such at the beginning of the public hearing by the chair. There should be no vocal, boisterous, or other disruptive demonstrations which will disrupt the orderly flow of the meeting. Any persons engaging in this type of behavior shall be ruled out of order by the chair and shall, at the chair's discretion, be removed from the assembly hall.

Time. At hearings on proposed rezonings, use permit, modification and/or concurrent variance petitions, as well as amendments to the text of the Fulton County Zoning Resolution (hereinafter "land-use petitions"), proponents and opponents are allowed ten minutes per side to present data, evidence and opinions. Each side's time period may be divided among multiple speakers in whatever manner desired. In the event a public hearing is conducted and final action on a land-use petition is deferred by the board of commissioners, a second public hearing (conducted under the same rules as set forth above) will be allowed when the petition is again considered by the board of commissioners following the deferral. No land-use petition shall be the subject of more than two public hearings before the board of commissioners, regardless of the number of times final action is deferred by the board of commissioners, unless four or more members of the board of commissioners vote to conduct such additional public hearing(s).
(4)
Once the public hearing has concluded, the chair shall so announce, and the board shall convene into open executive session to make its decisions.
(5)
As a general rule, members of the public do not speak on agenda items unless those items have been advertised for public hearing, have been placed in the public hearing segment of the agenda or unless the board, by four affirmative votes, has decided that public participation is necessary in its deliberative process. The board shall follow its public hearing rules when such participation is warranted.

Sec. 101-71. - Special meetings and rescheduled regular meetings.
Commissioners shall hold one session on the first Wednesday of every month at the county site in the courthouse building or in such office as shall be prepared for them, provided that a majority of said board may convene in extraordinary session whenever in their judgment it may be necessary. A regular meeting, except the first meeting of the month required by state law, may be canceled, rescheduled, or moved to a new location within the county site by the chair for any reason. Whenever the chair cancels, reschedules, or moves the regularly scheduled meeting, it must be done in accordance with O.C.G.A. tit. 50, ch. 14 (O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq.) the Georgia Open Meetings Act which requires that notice of the change is posted for at least 24 hours at the place of the regular meeting.

Other special meetings known as special call meetings may be scheduled by the chair at the request of four commissioners. Special call meetings are also governed by the notice requirements set forth above. When emergency circumstances occur, the board may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice. When such meetings are held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the county, or a newspaper with at least the general circulation of the legal organ, and to each member of the board as soon as practical. The notice shall include those subjects expected to be discussed at the meeting. In addition, the minutes shall reflect the reason for the emergency meeting and the nature of the notice given.

Only necessary staff shall be present at the executive session.
(b)
No officer or employee of Fulton County, which includes elected officials and their staff, may disclose confidential information gained by reason of discussion in executive session or a meeting closed to the public under the Open Meetings Act, nor may the officer or employee use such information for his, her, or their personal gain or benefit. For purposes of this Code section, "confidential information" means anything, or any matter discussed under the scope of the executive session, is not otherwise available to the public, or information made confidential by law.
(c)
In the interest of preventing the disclosure of confidential information, the board, by a vote of at least five members of the body, may find a member to have violated the confidential nature of an executive session, and decide to render appropriate sanctions against the violating member.
(d)
Upon becoming aware of a potential/apparent violation of this Code section, the board shall conduct a discussion during the next executive session at which the alleged violator is in attendance. The purpose of conducting the discussion in executive session is to provide for a full and thorough discussion while maintaining the confidential nature of the subject(s) of the alleged disclosure(s). This discussion shall include verbal notice of the allegations to the member alleged to have violated this Code section, followed by a public vote requiring the votes of at least five members of the board to determine that a violation occurred, and if so, appropriate sanctions against the violating member, to include a public reprimand and/or imposition of an administrative sanction of $1,000.00 per occurrence, to be immediately effective, and with such amount to be deducted from the compensation of the member found to be in violation.
