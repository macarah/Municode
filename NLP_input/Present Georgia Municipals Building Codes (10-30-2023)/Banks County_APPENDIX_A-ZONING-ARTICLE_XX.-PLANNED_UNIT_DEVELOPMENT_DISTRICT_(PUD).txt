ARTICLE XX. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD)

Sec. 2001. - Purpose and intent.
The Planned Unit Development District is intended to provide flexibility in the application of area, height, bulk, placement, and other zoning controls; provide for mixing a wide variety of residential housing types and arrangements; provide for the mixing of compatible residential, office, commercial and industrial land uses; encourage imaginative and innovative design for the unified development of tracts of land; provide an alternative for more efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby resulting in lower construction and maintenance costs to the public; preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within the development; and to promote land development in proper relation to the surrounding neighborhood; provide a more desirable living environment than would be possible through the strict application of conventional requirements; and to ensure that the design of the building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious.
This district is to be utilized as a "floating zone" which shall mean that areas will not be pre-designated as planned unit development districts, but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment. Planned Unit Development Districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the same amendment procedures as other districts. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and the land uses which are presented with the application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of the zoning regulations.
Any request pertaining to the establishment of a Planned Unit Development District shall be considered an amendment to the zoning regulations and shall be administered and processed in accordance with Section 1103 of the Zoning Ordinance of Banks County, Georgia.
(Ord. No. 2006-33, § 1, 9-12-2006)
Sec. 2002. - Definitions.
Active recreational facilities: Equipment and areas prepared for active use for recreational and leisure purposes, including but not limited to: playground equipment (swing sets and climbing structures); courts for basketball, volleyball, and tennis; leveled, striped fields for football, soccer or multiple purposes; community picnic pavilions (including covered facilities with grills and/or fire rings); community buildings for recreational events and golf courses, excluding clubhouses, developed areas and accessory uses. Trails and bikeways through open spaces shall not be considered active recreational facilities.
Open space: An area that is permanently set aside through dedication, designation, or reservation and is available to all occupants of a development and that is not used for or occupied by a public right-of-way, driveway, an off-street parking area, a loading space, a refuse storage space, or a building.
Passive recreational facilities: Recreational activities and places that generally do not require a developed site. This generally includes such activities as hiking, horseback riding and picnicking, provided that such activities occur in a manner that is consistent with existing natural conditions.

Sec. 2003. - Required conditions for Planned Unit Development District.
In order to qualify for a Planned Unit Development District zoning classification, a proposed development must first meet each of the following specific requirements:
(a)
The minimum site area for a Planned Unit Development District shall be 50 contiguous acres.
(b)
Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same zoning district, are proposed for development on a parcel under single or multiple ownership or management.
Sec. 2004. - Permitted uses and dimensional requirements.
Within a Planned Unit Development District, any land use may be permitted if such use or uses can be shown to provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to the Comprehensive Plan of Banks County. The permitted uses of property located in the planned unit development shall be those which have been specifically proposed by the applicant and approved by the governing body as a part of a planned unit development site plan, report, and/or other supporting information.
A planned unit development may depart from strict conformance with the required dimension, area, height, bulk, use and specific content regulations of the county's land use regulations to the extent specified in the PUD application if approved, so long as the PUD provides tangible benefits in the form of provisions of open space, amenities and quality design. The dimensional requirements of property located in the planned unit development shall be those, which have been specifically proposed by the applicant and approved by the governing body as a part of a planned unit development site plan, except as provided for in section 2009(e).
(Ord. No. 2006-33, § 1, 9-12-2006)
Sec. 2005. - Site plan approval required.
Applications for rezoning to or development within a Planned Unit Development District shall require a site plan, including, at a minimum, those items enumerated in section 2008 of these regulations.

The following specifications are not regulations, but recommended guidelines to be utilized in preparation of site plans for planned unit developments:
1.
Uses within the planned unit development shall be predominantly in accordance with the Banks County Comprehensive Plan.
2.
Land uses which have traditionally been viewed as incompatible (e.g. single-family subdivision and a manufacturing plant) should not be proposed in the same planned unit development unless considerable screening and physical separation are provided.
3.
For developments that are predominantly residential, commercial and office uses should be scaled so that they primarily serve the occupants of the development.
4.
Office, commercial and/or industrial uses should be located adjacent to major thoroughfares or in other areas with suitable access that will not result in traffic through residential areas.
5.
Lot sizes, lot widths, unit sizes and other characteristics of residential development within the planned unit development should be similar to those characteristics of adjacent or nearby residential subdivisions or provide a suitable transition from such adjacent uses.
6.
Location of land uses should conform substantially with land use plan goals, policies and suggested types of uses. The proposed development should be designed so as to produce an environment of stable and desirable character not out of harmony with its surrounding neighborhood.
7.
Street lengths, alignments, patterns and other characteristics should conform to county subdivision regulations or standard planning principles. Streets should provide interconnectivity within the development or with adjacent uses. Provisions should be made for multiple ingress and egress access to the development. Streets should take into consideration the use and safety of pedestrians.
8.
Large parking areas are discouraged. Parking should be provided in a variety of ways, including on-street parking, shared parking areas, or parking areas located to the side and/or rear of buildings.
9.
Proposed developments should make maximum use of natural features of the land. The development should minimize any adverse impacts on the natural features of the property, including streams, trees, vegetation and terrain.
10.
Interest and variety should be sought, by means of street design and changes in and mixtures of building types, heights, facades, setbacks, planting, or size of open space, the design should be harmonious as a whole and not simply from street-to-street.
11.
Sites for churches, schools, community or club buildings and similar public or semi-public facilities are encouraged to be provided, where appropriate.
