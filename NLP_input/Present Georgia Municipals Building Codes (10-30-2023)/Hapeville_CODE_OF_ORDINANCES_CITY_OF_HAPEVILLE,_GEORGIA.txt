PREFACE
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hapeville, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through November 7, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The Code has been divided into two parts, The Charter and Related Laws and The Code of Ordinances. Part I has been subdivided into subpart A, The Charter, and subpart B, Related Laws, and Part II has been further subdivided into subparts A, B and C, being General Ordinances, Environment, Health and Sanitation, and Planning and Development. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged within each subpart in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter, Article and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a dash. The figure before the first dash refers to the chapter number; the figure before the second dash refers to the article number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the article. Thus, the second section of chapter 2, article 2 is numbered 2-2-2, and the sixth section of chapter 5, article 3, is section 5-3-6. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and article, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 9-2-1 and 9-2-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 9-2-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, or in the case of chapters placed at the end of the title embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the chapter, article or division.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

  Indexes
The indexes have been prepared to be useful to either city personnel or the general public. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Grace Tavel, Senior Legal Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Alice Shepard, Deputy City Clerk, Mike Rast, City Administrator, and Murray J. Weed, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section d. The provisions appearing in this code, so far as they are the same as provisions or ordinances existing at the time of the effective date of this code, are intended, and shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.
