Editor's note— Ord. No. 2013-02-06, adopted Feb. 11, 2013, deleted the former Div. 2, §§ 18-40—18-46, and enacted a new Div. 2 as set out herein. The former Div. 2 pertained to false alarms and derived from Ord. No. O2006-12-25, ch. 12, art. 2, §§ 1—7, 12-19-2006.

Sec. 18-40. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The purpose of this division is to encourage alarm owners and alarm businesses to properly use and maintain the operational effectiveness of alarm systems in order to improve the reliability of alarm systems and reduce or eliminate false alarms. The City of Johns Creek finds that excessive false alarms unduly burden the city police and fire departments and waste limited public safety resources.
(b)
This division governs alarm systems intended to summon a public safety department and requires registration, provides for the assessment of civil penalties for excessive false alarms, provides procedures for repeat offenders, provides for the severability of the parts hereof if declared invalid, and provides an effective date.
