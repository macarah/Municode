B.
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this section, unless otherwise specifically stated:
Commission means the state soil and water conservation commission.
Cut means a portion of land surface or area from which earth has been removed or will be removed by excavation; the depth below original ground surface to excavated surface. Also known as "excavation."
District means the county soil and water conservation district.
Erosion and sediment control plan (the "plan") means a plan for the control of soil erosion and sediment resulting from land-disturbing activity.
Existing grade means the vertical location of the existing ground surface prior to cutting or filling.
Filling means the placement of any soil or other solid material on natural ground surface or excavation.
Finished grade means the final grade or elevation and contour of the ground after cutting or filling and conforming to the proposed design.
Grading means altering the shape of the ground surfaces to a predetermined condition; this includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling and shaping or any combination thereof and shall include the land in its cut or filled condition.
Issuing authority means the governing authority of any county or municipality which has been certified by the director of the environmental protection division of the department of natural resources as an issuing authority, pursuant to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended.
Land-disturbing activity means any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state waters or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land but not including agricultural practices as described in this chapter
Local planning commission means the city planning and zoning commission.
Natural ground surface means the ground surface in its original state before any grading, excavation or filling.
Permit means the authorization necessary to conduct a land-disturbing activity under this section.
Person means any individual, partnership, firm, association, entity, joint venture, public or private corporation, LLC, trust, estate, commission, board, public or private institution, utility, cooperative, state agency, municipality or other political subdivision of this state, any interstate body or any other legal entity.
Sediment means solid material, both organic and inorganic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by air, water, ice or gravity as a product of erosion.
Slope means degree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal, usually expressed in percent or degree.
Stabilization means the process of establishing an enduring soil cover of vegetation by installing temporary or permanent structures for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the erosion process and the resultant transport of sediment by wind, water, ice or gravity.
State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural and artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single person.
Structural erosion and sediment control practices means the practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures, sediment traps, land grading, etc. Such measures can be found in the publication, Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
Vegetative erosion and sediment control measures means the measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass.
Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any areas adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
