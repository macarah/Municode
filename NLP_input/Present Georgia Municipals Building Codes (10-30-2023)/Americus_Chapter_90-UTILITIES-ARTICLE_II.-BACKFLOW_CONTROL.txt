Sec. 90-23. - Definitions.
The definitions found in the city plumbing code for backflow, cross-connections, and backflow prevention devices shall be those used in this article. In addition, the following definitions shall apply:
Air gap means a physical separation sufficient to prevent backflow between the free-flowing discharge end of the potable water system and any other system. Physically defined as a distance equal to twice the diameter of the supply side pipe diameter but never less than one inch.
Approved means accepted by the director of public works as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this regulation, or as suitable for the proposed use.
Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the city's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural sources such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the city does not have sanitary control.
Backflow means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under positive or reduced pressure in the distribution pipes of a potable water supply from any source other than its intended source.
Backflow preventer means a device or means designed to prevent backflow or backsiphonage. Most commonly categorized as air gap, reduced pressure principal assembly, double-check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker, atmospheric vacuum breaker, hose bibb vacuum breaker, residential dual check and barometric loop.
Containment means a method of backflow prevention which requires a backflow preventer at the water service entrance.
Contaminant means a substance that will impair the quality of the water to a degree that it creates a serious health hazard to the public, leading to poisoning or the spread of disease.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
Cross-connection means a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that, under any circumstances, would allow such substances to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids or solids, such as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or nonpotable), or any other matter that may change the color and/or add odor to the water.
Cross-connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection.
Cross-connection, controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Customer means a person or entity receiving water or sewer services from the City of Americus Public Works Department.
Department means the City of Americus Public Works Department.
Double-check backflow preventer means an assembly of two independently operating spring-loaded check valves with tightly-closing shut off valves on each side of the check valves and properly located test cocks allowing for the testing of each check valve on each line, specifically a double-check valve assembly (DCVA) or a double-check detector assembly (DCDA).
Hazard assessment means a hazard determination conducted pursuant to Section 608 of the Georgia State Minimum Standard Plumbing Code.
Hazard, degree of, means the term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system.
Hazard, health, means any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the building official, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer.
Hazard, plumbing, means a plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or approved backflow prevention device.
Hazard, pollutional, means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
Hazard, system, means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but is not limited to: Polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulating cooling water connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes.
Owner means any person who has legal title to, or license to operate or inhabit, a property upon which a cross-connection inspection is to be made or upon which a cross-connection is deemed likely by the City of Americus Public Works.
Permit means a document issued by the department which allows the installation of a backflow preventer.
Person means any individual, partnership, company, public or private corporation, political subdivision or agency of the state department, agency or instrumentality or the United States or any other legal entity.
Pollutant means a foreign substance that, if permitted to get into the public water system, will degrade its quality so as to constitute a moderate hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree that does not create an actual hazard to the public health, but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such water for domestic use.
Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer means an assembly consisting of two independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two check valves, tightly-closing shut-off valves on each side of the check valves and properly located test cocks allowing for the testing of the check valves and the relief valve on each line, specifically a reduced pressure principal assembly (RP) or a reduced pressure principal detector assembly (RPDA).
Residential dual check means an assembly of two spring loaded, independently operating check valves without tightly closing shut-off valves or test cocks. Generally employed immediately downstream of the water meter to act as a containment device.
Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the term "service connection" shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There shall be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.
Water used means any water supplied by the city from the public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the city water department.
