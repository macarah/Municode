Sec. 14-348. - Traffic improvements, street improvements, curb cuts, visibility requirements, and private street construction standards.
(a)
Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or private street. Private streets shall only be allowed if the development seeking to have a private streets is ten acres or larger in size. The community development department shall have the authority to waive this minimum acreage requirement if all real property owners that abut the proposed private street agree to such waiver.
(b)
Where this chapter measures minimum building setback lines and frontages, or imposes development standards in connection with, or with reference to public streets, such measurements or standards set forth in the district regulations and supplemental regulations of chapter 27, in this chapter or elsewhere in this Code shall apply similarly for property abutting a private street. Nothing in this article is intended to authorize any kind of development on a private street that would not be authorized where there was public right-of-way.
(c)
Private streets within any zoning district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this Code. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations. The names of these streets shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits as provided in this chapter and chapters 7 and 27. The geographical information services department shall approve all private street names and addresses, thereby avoiding conflicting names and addresses.
(d)
Lots may front on a public street or private street constructed to the standards found in this chapter.
(e)
Where sewer lines are constructed underneath a private street, the developer is required to grant an easement to the county or city for installation, maintenance and repair of such sewer lines.

Private streets shall not be eligible for participation in the city's traffic calming program as provided for in chapter 17.
(g)
Private streets shall not be eligible for participation in the city's residential sidewalk district program as provided for in chapter 23.
(h)
Developers and property owners' associations shall ensure access to all private streets by emergency and law enforcement vehicles and shall ensure that private streets are constructed to allow access by all emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles.
(i)
The use of private streets may not result in an increase in permitted density above that which would otherwise be permitted by the applicable district regulations. Density calculations shall be made based on a public street system and the preliminary plat that provides for a private street shall be density neutral. Additionally, a utility easement is not to be included in any plat as a part of an individual lot and thus such land that comprises the utility easements cannot be used to calculate the required minimum lot size, or minimum front yard size.
(j)
Private streets shall comply with requirements for public streets found in this chapter and all other applicable sections of this Code. Private streets shall be surfaced with the same type of materials that are used by the city's department of public works for the surfacing and resurfacing of public streets or with materials that are as protective as those used by the city to surface and resurface streets so long as such alternative materials are approved by the director of public works.

The community development department may authorize a private street when the applicant has submitted all required documentation as set forth herein and where the community development department finds that:
(1)
The location of the proposed private streets will not adversely impact use of any existing surrounding public streets;
(2)
The location of the proposed private street will not adversely impact adjacent existing communities or neighborhoods;
(3)
The applicant has shown that there is the requisite legal mechanism for the maintenance of the proposed private streets; and
(4)
The applicant has provided written evidence that the proposed private street system is acceptable to the city and county departments or divisions responsible for law enforcement, sanitation, transportation and fire and rescue.
(b)
Street rights-of-way shall be owned by the mandatory homeowners' association as required by section 14-350. Street rights-of-way shall comply with all the requirements set forth in this Code, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in this chapter and in chapter 27. An access easement and a utility easement shall entirely overlay the rights-of-way and shall be dedicated to city for public use. All applicable setbacks, lot widths and lot areas shall be measured from the homeowner's association right-of-way.
(Ord. No. 2014-12-06, § 1(14-189.2), 12-16-2014)

(a)
Maintenance of private streets.
(1)
Each developer that chooses to include private streets within a condominium, as that term is defined by state law, or any other residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial or office development shall organize and establish a property owners' association prior to recording of the final plat. Membership in the property owners' association shall be mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit within the development. The property owners' association shall be organized so that it has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over the private streets and required improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses. The declaration of covenants creating the property owners' association shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county and the recorded declaration of covenants and articles of incorporation creating the property owners' association shall provide that all private streets and associated improvements are owned by the property owners' association or are held in common by the property owners within the development. Said streets shall be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the city. The recorded declaration of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to repair and maintain each private street in the same manner as similar public streets are maintained by the city and such maintenance and repair shall be performed in compliance with all city standards and all applicable provisions of law.
(2)
Prior to any final plat approval, the developer shall submit articles of incorporation, declaration of covenants and bylaws for the property owners' association to the community development department. Those documents must thereafter be reviewed and approved by the city attorney.
(b)
Maintenance fund. The declaration of covenants and articles of association shall provide for a street maintenance fund the proceeds of which shall be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the streets, whether for resurfacing or a similar purpose. For the purposes of further providing further assurance that city funds shall not be used for maintenance of private streets, the developer shall submit proof of deposit of 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by community development director or designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association.
(c)
Maintenance bond. At the end of the 12-month maintenance period provided for in section 14-675, a developer must provide a maintenance bond renewable annually to cover the cost of maintenance and repair for any private streets within a subdivision. The bond shall be for an amount equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee. The developer may avoid securing the maintenance bond set forth in this subsection if the developer submits proof to the community development department that 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee, has been deposited in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. If the developer chooses this alternative, the declarations of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to continuously maintain 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs of the private streets in this maintenance fund.
(d)
Assessment and liens. The property owners' association must be empowered to levy assessments against owners within the development for the payment of expenditures made by the association for maintenance of the private streets and other items set forth in subsection (a) of this section. At least 15 percent of all fees or assessments paid shall be set aside in the maintenance fund. Any unpaid assessments shall constitute a lien in favor of the property owners' association on the lot, building or unit of the owner.

The developer shall be notified of any deficiencies in writing and such deficiencies shall be corrected within 60 days of the written notice of deficiencies unless the city agrees to extension of that period in writing.
(b)
Failure to correct the complete list of deficiencies shall be a violation of this section and shall subject the developer to prosecution for a code violation in the municipal court of city. Any person found to have violated this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500.00 for each violation. A separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed each day on which such person shall continue any such violation.
(c)
The community development director or designee shall deny the issuance of certificates of occupancy until all deficiencies have been corrected.

(1)
Contains all of the evidence and documents required by this article and has been reviewed by community development department;
(2)
Is supported by an analysis by public works department that shows that the street is no longer used by the public to the extent that it serves no substantial public purpose and that the public at large will benefit from its closure since the public will no longer be responsible for any costs to maintain and repair the street; and
(3)
Is supported by an analysis by the community development department that shows that the abandonment of the street shall not negatively impact adjacent neighboring communities and the public at large.
Deferral of a petition or failure to provide a recommendation by the community development department shall not prevent the governing authority from taking any and all appropriate action with respect to the petition identified in this section.
