ARTICLE IV. - LOT AND BUILDING STANDARDS

Sec. 89-401. - Purpose of article.
This article sets out the standards that control the size of lots, the placement of buildings and structures on a lot, and the bulk and intensity of development on a lot.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-402. - Minimum lot frontage.
(a)
Street frontage required. Every property must front on a street from which direct access can be gained that has been opened and accepted as a public street or is a recorded private street approved by the board of commissioners.
(b)
Minimum frontage.
(1)
Every lot and every multi-family or nonresidential development must have minimum street frontage equal to 50 feet, except as follows:
(2)
Exceptions to minimum frontage requirement:
a.
Lots fronting primarily on a cul-de-sac turnaround, or any right-of-way having a curve radius of 60 feet or less, shall not have less than 35 feet of street frontage.
b.
A townhouse subdivision lot shall have at least 20 feet of street frontage.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-403. - Maximum density, minimum lot area and width.
(a)
Every property upon which a principal building or use will be located shall meet or exceed the requirements shown on Table 4.1 for the zoning district in which the lot is situated.
(b)
Maximum density.
(1)
The total number of dwelling units in a residential subdivision or development shall not exceed the gross area of the subdivision or development property multiplied by the maximum density shown on Table 4.1. Residential densities are shown on the table as the number of dwelling units per acre.
(2)
The maximum nonresidential density figures shown on Table 4.1 are used to determine the amount of gross floor area for nonresidential uses that can be constructed on a lot. Maximum floor area is determined by multiplying the floor area ratio (FAR) times the area of the lot in square feet. For instance, a one-acre lot at 0.5 FAR could accommodate 21,780 square feet of floor area (43,560 square feet of lot area × 0.5 FAR).
