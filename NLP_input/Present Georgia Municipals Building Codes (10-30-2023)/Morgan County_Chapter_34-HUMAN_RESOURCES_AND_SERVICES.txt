Sec. 34-1. - Indigent burial expenses.
If the estate of a deceased, indigent, Morgan County resident is insufficient to pay for the burial of the deceased, the county may pay up to $350.00 to the funeral home providing the funeral and/or burial services. Whether the deceased was indigent, and if so, the amount that the county will pay, shall be determined by the county manager. If the representative of the deceased's estate is dissatisfied with the county manager's determination, he or she may appeal that determination to the board of commissioners.
