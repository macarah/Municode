Building sewer means the extension from the building drain to the public sewer or other place of disposal.
Commercial user or contributor means premises or a person who discharges industrial wastes which are similar to domestic wastes in nature, and do not exceed those parameters which define normal sewage except as to volume, in which case it shall be defined as an industrial user.
Industrial user or contributor means an industry which discharges wastewaters having the characteristics of industrial wastes, as distinct from commercial wastes or domestic wastes, and having a BOD of 200 mg/l or greater and/or a total suspended solids of 200 mg/l or greater, or having a total discharge volume in excess of 24,000 gallons per month regardless of whether the waste concentration is less than these limits or not.
Properly shredded garbage means the waste from the preparation of cooking and dispensing of food that has been shredded to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater than one-half inch in any dimension.
Public sewer means a sewer in which all owners of abutting properties have equal rights and is controlled by public authority.
Residential domestic user or contributor means premises or a person who discharges wastewaters to the city or county sewers, which closely match normal sewer as to strength; and volume does not exceed 24,000 gallons per month, and further for billing purposes, is defined as a dwelling place of residence. If the volume discharged exceeds 24,000 gallons per month, it shall be defined as an industrial user.
Sewer means a pipe or conduit for carrying sewage.
Sewer surcharge means a charge for sewer service and treatment service for wastes having characteristics different from sanitary wastes and for which additional charges must be assessed in order for the waste to be processed properly and to compensate the city for additional expenses incurred.

ARTICLE IV. - REGULATION OF PRIVATE WELLS

Sec. 14-76. - Statement of purpose.
The construction of private wells within the city has increased dramatically over the past several years, threatening the viability of the city water system and creating the potential for indirect polluting of our potable water supply through cross connection. The mayor and council, after considerable investigation and consideration of alternatives, have adopted this article as the best available means of meeting mandatory federal and state water-quality standards and of protecting the system and the health and safety of its users.
(Code 1992, § 5-4-1)
Sec. 14-77. - Statement of the problem.
(a)
The removal of the system's volume consumers from the system weakens the city's ability to maintain the system as a self-sufficient utility at a cost commensurate with the ability of the least able consumer to pay for the service. This problem has now reached critical proportions.
(b)
The city water system must comply with the Georgia Rules for Safe Drinking Water and the Federal Safe Water Act. A cross connection control program is essential to this end.
(c)
Cross connection, in its simplest term, is an inter-connection between two water systems/sources. These connections may be direct connections or indirect connections. An example of a direct connection is one where a customer is not only connected to the public water system, but also has a private well. If these two systems are connected at any point in the plumbing, a cross-connection exists. This connection is most dangerous because if there is a difference in pressure between the two systems, water will flow from the one with the higher pressure to the one with the lower pressure. In general, private systems are not controlled as to water quality. Should the private system be polluted and the public system experience a lower pressure, this polluted water would flow into the potable water, thus reducing its quality, possible to the point of causing serious illness to other customers of the public water supply system.
(d)
An indirect connection is one in which no permanent connection exists, but may create a flow of water from a polluted source to a potable source. An example of this type would be in a situation where a vat of chemicals was being diluted with water from the public system using a hose. If the hose were below the liquid level and a sudden pressure drop occurred in the public system, the chemical solution could be back-siphoned into the public system.
(e)
Cross connections have always been a concern to waterworks operators; however only in recent years has the problem received much attention. In recent years the potential for indirect polluting of public water supplies has increased tremendously. Thus, the need for a comprehensive well water and cross connection control ordinance.
