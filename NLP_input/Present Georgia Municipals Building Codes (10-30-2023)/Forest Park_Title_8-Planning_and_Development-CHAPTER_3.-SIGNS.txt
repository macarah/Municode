(2)

All nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good repair, free from peeled paint, rust, missing panels, missing letters, etc. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs, changes in shape, size, or design shall be permitted except to make a nonconforming sign comply with all requirements of this section. Repairs; material change. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted when the cost of such repair does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the replacement cost of the existing sign, provided, however, that no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the standards of this chapter.
(3)
Legal-nonconforming or "grandfathering" and provisions. Nonconforming signs may stay in place until one (1) of the following conditions occurs:
a.
The advertised business ceases at the location for a period of more than thirty (30) days and/or the sign is not used for a period of more than thirty (30) days;
b.
The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or renders it dilapidated, unsightly, or unkempt;
c.
The sign has been damaged to such an extent that more than minor repairs (greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the sign replacement cost of the existing sign) or a material change is required to restore the sign. No structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the standards of this chapter; or
d.
If the business or use for which the nonconforming sign(s) was installed is expanded or modified, and if the value of the expansion or modification exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the existing improvements. The sign or signs shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter with a new permit secured therefore or shall be removed. All improvements to a single business or use within any 12-month period shall be treated cumulatively in the administration of this subparagraph.
(4)
In the event that a sign loses its legal-nonconforming (grandfathering) status, the applicant shall not be granted a business license until the nonconforming sign is brought into compliance with the regulations in the chapter 3, Signs, otherwise known as the sign ordinance.
All signs within the city must be brought into compliance or removed within three (3) years from the adoption of this chapter. At this time, all signs will lose their legal nonconforming status.
