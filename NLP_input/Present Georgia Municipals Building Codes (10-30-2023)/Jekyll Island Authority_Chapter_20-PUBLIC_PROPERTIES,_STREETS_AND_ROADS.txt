(Code 1981, § 10A-101(4))
Sec. 20-22. - Same—Review by the authority.
(a)
Within ten working days of receipt of an application, the executive director of the authority shall review the application in light of all of the contents thereof and render a decision and communicate same to the applicant, either permitting the event as planned or denying a permit for same. If the permit is denied, the executive director of the authority shall provide the applicant, in writing, a statement of the reasons therefor. (First class mail to the address provided by applicant, postmarked no more than ten working days after receipt of the application, shall be sufficient for this purpose, though not the exclusive means of notice.)
(b)
Nothing in this process shall prevent the executive director of the authority, at his sole option and within the ten-day period for approval or denial, to confer with the applicant with respect to modifications of the applicant's plan for the event, and amend the application to reflect such modifications if agreed to by the applicant. However, the applicant may neither supplement nor amend its application within said ten-day period except at the invitation of the authority. Any attempt to do so sua sponte shall be deemed a separate and new application.
(c)
The executive director of the authority may deny the application for a permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons:
(1)
The application does not contain all required information, or that information set out is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the authority;

The applicant or entity represented by applicant is incompetent to contract, sue, or be sued;
(4)
The person applying lacks authority to represent the entity for which the application is made;

The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions damaged public property, or has not paid in full for such damages, or is in arrears as to any judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant or entity, whether under the same name or another;
(6)
The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in connection with events of a substantially similar nature;
(7)
The plan of the event as proposed is likely to present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public);
(8)
The plan of the event as proposed is likely to unduly restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public roads, rights-of-way, sidewalks or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event;
(9)
The plan of the event as proposed is likely to constitute an unreasonable disturbance of the peace, or would unreasonably burden lawful commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public);
(10)
The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the state, or ordinances of the city, county or the authority, or activities which constitute nuisance or tortuous conduct with respect to public or private property or persons;
(11)
The plan of the event as proposed would conflict with previously planned programs or events organized and conducted by the authority and previously scheduled for the same time and place;
(12)
The plan of the event as proposed is prohibited by or is inconsistent with the classifications and uses of the proposed or desired location; or
(13)
A fully executed prior application for permit has been or will be granted to a prior applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit multiple occupancy of that particular space.
(d)
It is the specific intent of the authority in enacting this article to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors which the authority finds express and support the substantial and compelling interests of the authority in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health, and good order of its society, are the only bases upon which the executive director of the authority shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder, and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant.
(Code 1981, § 10A-101(5))
Sec. 20-23. - Revocation.
Notwithstanding the grant of any permit as provided herein, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate an event at any time, or prevent its initiation, should traffic, weather or other conditions develop which present an imminent and undue danger to those participating in the event pursuant to said permit, to the public at large, or should any consideration or combination of considerations enumerated in this article as grounds for denial of a permit arise or first become apparent to law enforcement authorities after the grant of a permit. If in preparation for or after the start of an event for which a permit has been issued, participants in said event violate the terms of the permit or deviate in material fashion from the plan submitted in application for the permit, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate the event.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS

Sec. 20-47. - Authority property.
It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to convert public authority property to private use unless specific written authorization from the authority has first been had and obtained. This prohibition shall include, but not be limited to, easements, rights-of-way and authority land not under lease to an individual.
(Code 1981, § 11-101)
Sec. 20-48. - All property held in trust.
Each lease of property on the island is granted and accepted with the express understanding that the island is held in trust by the authority for park purposes and that any use of the premises or buildings or any conduct or activity of any occupant of any premises or buildings, which, in the opinion of the authority, is inconsistent with such trust is strictly prohibited.
(Code 1981, § 11-102)
Sec. 20-49. - All property subject to Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act.
Each lease of property on the island is granted and accepted subject to all the terms and conditions of the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act, as amended, at the time of execution. As provided in the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act ("Act"), the leasing activity of the authority is the business activity of the authority from which it shall gain revenues to support and maintain and develop and beautify the island and to furnish the people of the state with as much free, nonprofit or subsidized recreation as may be possible. Under the Act the leasing activity is but an instrumentality through which the public services are to be accomplished and for this reason this activity must always be subservient to the ultimate public service objectives of the Act. These conditions and limitations of leasing island property, which have not been reduced to restrictions and recorded on the various plats of the leased property, relate to general day to day use of the property by lease occupants and their conduct generally considered in the light of the purposes of the creation of the authority. Both the purpose and the scope of these conditions and limitations make it impractical to attempt to set forth in a definite form a specific, separate statement of each act prohibited, but all may be easily understood and encompassed by the following general rules:
(1)
Each occupant of property on the island shall use and enjoy that property he has the right to occupy and cause all guests and visitors and friends to use and enjoy the same in such a manner as not to conflict with the use of enjoyment of the park areas by the general public and the other several leased areas by the several other occupants in those areas. Every normal and usual recreational and social use may be made of all residential properties and every usual and acceptable and licensed business use may be made of the properties leased specifically for business purposes, but no lewd, licentious or illegal use shall be made of such property.
(2)
It shall be the responsibility of the occupants of any lot or parcel of lease property upon the island to preserve and maintain the cleanliness, orderliness and good appearance of the property which they occupy. No unclean, unsightly or unkempt conditions of buildings or grounds which shall tend to destroy the beauty of the island as a whole or the specific area will be permitted. Furthermore, no occupant of the lease property upon the island shall through his activity destroy or detract from the cleanliness, orderliness or beauty of the island or each areas by placing or leaving therein or thereon debris or refuse or unsightly objects of any kind, it being understood that each occupant has not only the duty of maintaining the cleanliness, orderliness and beauty of the lot or parcel he may occupy, but also has the further duty of not defacing or in anywise detracting from the beauty of the remainder of the island.
(3)
Every occupant of the leased property shall be responsible for conducting himself in a fashion consonant with the use and purposes of the entire island. Furthermore, no occupant shall maintain any plants or animals or keep or operate any device or thing of any sort whose normal activities or existence is in any wise noxious, dangerous, unsightly, or of a nature as will necessarily diminish or destroy the enjoyment of other occupants or the general public at any point throughout the island.
(Code 1981, § 11-103)
Sec. 20-50. - Applicable law.
All violations of the conditions and limitations set forth in section 20-49 shall be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the state and the ordinances of the county and any and all ordinances of the authority.
(Code 1981, § 11-104)
Sec. 20-51. - Applicable restrictions, conditions, limitations, easements, rights, privileges, etc.
All property on the island, both residential and business, is subject to certain restrictions, conditions, limitations, easements, rights, privileges, etc., as recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county on December 27, 1954, in book 7-Q, page 361.
(Code 1981, § 11-105)
Sec. 20-52. - Lease information.
(a)
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Trade secrets includes information of a privileged or confidential nature, whether the nature of such information is financial or otherwise.
(b)
Upon the reasonable request of the executive director, all lessees and tenants of the authority whose leases or rental agreements pertain to the operation of a business on the island shall submit information pertaining to the business to the authority even though such information may constitute trade secrets.

Definitions. For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them:
Branch collar means the swelling where a branch joins the trunk of a tree. The callus that forms the collar is an area of tissue that contains a chemically protective zone which helps the tree heal after pruning.
Buildable area means that portion of a site, exclusive of the minimum required yard (setback) areas and the building site, on which a structure or building may be erected. The term "buildable area" also means the portion of a parcel of land where a building may be located and which shall contain enough square footage to meet the minimum required by the zoning district. The portion which is not located in the minimum setbacks, utility corridors, driveways, slopes to build streets, tree save areas, landscape strips, specimen tree areas, wetlands, stormwater and sanitary sewer easements.
Building means any structure built for the support shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, chattel or property of any kind.
Building site means that portion of a lot which is occupied by a building or that portion of a site which is proposed to be occupied by a building and for which a building permit has been issued.
Caliper means the standard for trunk measurements of nursery stocks. The caliper of the trunk shall be taken at breast height (4½ feet) above the ground.
Critical root zone means the area of tree roots within the crown drip line. The zone is generally defined as a circle with a radius extending from a tree's trunk to a point no less than the furthest crown drip line. Disturbances within this zone will directly affect a tree's chance for survival.
Crown drip line means a vertical line extending down to the ground from the end of a tree's longest branches.
Damage or abuse means any action, which does not follow good arboricultural practices. The term "abuse" also includes excessive pruning, which significantly alters the aesthetic appearance or endangers survivability of the tree, damage inflicted upon roots by machinery, changing the natural grade above the root system or around the trunk, and changing drainage patterns.
Density factor for the site (DFS) means a unit of measure used to prescribe and calculate required tree coverage on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size at dbh.
Diameter at breast height (dbh) means the diameter of a tree, measured at breast height (4½ feet) above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4½ feet, the diameter of each trunk shall be measured individually and added together.
Drip line means an imaginary vertical line that extends downward from the outermost branches of a tree to the ground.
Historic tree means any tree species which has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 24 inches or larger. Typically any tree species of this diameter is at least 50 years of age or older, however this can vary greatly depending upon the type of tree species and microclimate which it is growing in.
Land disturbing activity means any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and movement of sediments into state water or onto lands with the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land.
Live oak tree means any live oak (Quercus virginiana) that has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of two inches or larger.
Lot means a plot or parcel of leased land considered a unit, devoted to a certain use or occupied by a building or group of buildings permitted in the chapter 16, zoning, and having its principal frontage upon a street or access in accordance with municipal regulations, and the customary accessories and open spaces belonging to the same.
Protected trees means any living, self-supporting woody perennial plant which has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of four inches or larger is defined as a tree. Also, any live oak (Quercus virginiana) that has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of two inches or larger.
Protective barricade means a physical structure not less than four feet in height, limiting access to protected and significant trees. A suitable protective barrier shall be composed of wood or other durable material, which insures protection of significant and protected trees during development and/or construction improvements (see figure 1 in section 20-95).
Removal of trees means any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to decline and die, including, but not limited to, such damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of toxic substances, the operation or filling above the root system or around the trunk of a tree, pruning, and damages from injury or fire inflicted on trees which result in or permit pest infestation.
Replacement tree means any tree that is planted in order to replace an existing tree which must be removed. Replacement trees must have a minimum diameter at breast height (dbh) of 2½ to three inches in caliper. Multitrunk trees must have a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. The tree inspector may require a larger size based on the size and value of the tree to be replaced.
Root collar means the point of attachment of major woody roots to the tree trunk, usually at or near the ground line and associated with a marked swelling of the tree trunk.
Root respiration means an active process occurring throughout the feeder root system of trees and involving the consumption of oxygen and sugars with the release of energy and carbon dioxide. Root respiration facilitates the uptake and transport of minerals and nutrients essential for tree survival.
Site means any plot, lot, parcel or tract of land within the jurisdiction of this article.
Soil compaction means a change in soil physical properties which includes an increase in soil weight per unit volume and a decrease in soil pore space. Soil compaction is caused by repeated vibrations, frequent traffic and weight. As related to tree roots, compacted soil can cause physical root damage, a decrease in soil oxygen levels with an increase in toxic gasses, and can be impervious to new root development.
Specimen tree means a tree which is designated upon approval by the tree inspector, a certified arborist or authorized agents to be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size, historic association or unique aesthetic value. The tree must be in good or fair condition (see section 20-95) in order to merit this designation. All specimen trees permitted to be removed will require a 3:1 caliper-inch replacement.
Topping means a practice of cutting back the entire crown of mature trees to stubs. It is a destructive pruning practice that is stressful to mature trees, and may result in reduced vigor, decline or even death of a tree. In addition, new branches that form below the cuts are only weakly attached to the tree, and are in danger of splitting out.
Tree inspector means the tree inspector for the authority, or his designee. The individual or entity having the primary responsibility to administer and enforce the standards set forth in this article. The landscape superintendent or code enforcement officer shall serve as the tree inspector or assigned designee during an absence.
Tree mitigation fund means that in lieu of planting mitigation trees on the leased site, payment may be made as fair compensation for replacement of trees. Revenue collected in this fund will be used to support tree planting and tree maintenance throughout the island.
Tree replacement schedule means a plan showing the location, species and sizes of all replacement trees.
Tree save area means all areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees and/or preserving natural buffers.
Yard area means that portion of any site covered by the front, side and rear yard areas as established by the minimum setback requirements in chapter 16, zoning for respective zoning district classifications.

Sec. 20-79. - Violations and penalties.
(a)
If the tree inspector shall find that any of the provisions of this article are being violated, he shall in writing notify the owner of the property and the general building contractor. Written notification shall indicate the nature of the violation and/or the action necessary to correct the violation.
(b)
The issuance of a building permit and the failure to substantially erect building improvements within 12 months combined with removal of trees in the buildable area and the building site shall be deemed as a violation of this article. Each tree removed shall be identified as a separate offense.
(c)
Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this article or fail to comply therewith, shall for each such failure or violation or noncompliance shall subject to a fine not to exceed $50.00 per day or shall be provided and stipulated by law.

(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 3)
Sec. 20-82. - Tree inspector approval required for certain trees.
(a)
No person, firm, organization (including the authority), society, association or corporation, or any agent or representative thereof, shall directly or indirectly destroy or remove any four-inch dbh native shade tree or larger, or two-inch dbh live oak, without approval of the tree inspector, or any unless otherwise authorized under provisions of this article.
(b)
All utility companies, electric suppliers and governmental agencies constructing or maintaining easements for television transmission or rights-of-way will not be exempt from the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 4)
Sec. 20-83. - Tree trimming/pruning.
(a)
No person, firm, organization, (including the authority), society, association or corporation, or agent or representative thereof, shall directly or indirectly prune or remove any branch larger than two inches in diameter on any shade tree without approval of the tree inspector. Prior to engaging in such pruning activity, approval must be granted by the tree inspector in the form of a tree permit. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit. Trimming native and exotic palm trees, foundation plantings and branches less than two inches in diameter will not require the approval or notification of the tree inspector and is exempt from the tree permit process.
(b)
All pruning must be performed to the pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees shall apply.
(c)
All branches that are removed need to have their finished cuts made immediately beyond the bark ridges, preserving the branch collar. Stub cuts cannot be made more than one inch or more beyond the branch collar. Flush cuts must be made adjacent and not through the branch collar in order for the resulting tree wounds to heal properly.
(d)
Significant pruning cuts that result in drastic reduction of a tree's canopy, negatively impact the tree's overall aesthetics or flush cuts that exceed one-third of the size of the diameter of the tree trunk or branch at the point in which the flush cut is made will require mitigation. For every caliper inch in width of the branch at the location of the final flush cut, each caliper inch will have to be mitigated at a 1:2 ratio. If several tree limbs are removed, each cut will be assessed as a separate mitigation requirement. However, in no circumstance will the mitigation requirement exceed more than one-half of the overall dbh of the tree.
(e)
Creating stub cuts, random branch removal, and the topping of native shade trees are strictly prohibited. These practices defeat the primary aim of ensuring long-term tree health, create hazards, and drastically reduce the monetary value of trees.
(f)
Pruning and removal of trees in utility easements or rights of way shall be the minimum necessary to protect the property of the applicable utility company. Pruning shall be performed to the pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees. All branches removed must be flush cuts or pruned back to the branch collar of the adjoining main branch or trunk of the tree. Cutting into the branch collar will not be permitted as the collar helps the tree heal after pruning. The authority shall be informed by the applicable utility company of the time and approximate location of any tree pruning or removal activities in rights-of-way easements prior to conducting such activities.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 5)
Sec. 20-84. - New construction requirements.
(a)
Application and scope.
(1)
The destruction of any tree without a written permit is prohibited on any parcel of leased land. For new building construction, a tree survey must first be conducted to identify all healthy and structurally weak trees on the site in order to facilitate the overall design of the site. Having this information readily available in the initial design phase will allow the property owner to identify which trees are worth saving in order minimize mitigation requirements as well as minimize construction impacts to the trees that will remain.
(2)
For a property owner wanting to make an addition to a structural unit, it must be a minimum of ten feet from the trunk of historic trees and all live oaks (Quercus virginiana) or follow the 3:1 rule as described within subsection (b)(3) of this section, encroachment.
(3)
Encroachment of an addition shall not be permitted within the base of a protected, historic or specimen tree, unless special construction methods, including but not limited to beam foundations, are used and certified as acceptable by the authority's tree inspector. The owner will bear full responsibility to any future damage the tree may cause such as cracking or foundation upheaval if it occurs.
(b)
During development.
(1)
Protective barricades required. Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees and significant trees located in a development area prior to the commencement of any work, and shall remain in place until development activities are complete or construction in accordance with standards set forth in this section commences. The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building materials, dirt or other construction materials, debris, vehicles and development activities. Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from the base of protected trees and significant trees according to the following standards:
a.
For protected trees eight inches dbh, protective barricades shall be placed a minimum distance of ten feet from the base of each protected tree or to drip line.
b.
Protected trees greater than ten inches dbh, protective barricades shall be placed at a minimum distance of one foot for each inch of dbh or to drip line (see figure 1 in section 20-95).
c.
Protective barricades will only be permitted to be placed closer to a tree upon approval by the tree inspector.
(2)
Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas, which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging. All passive tree protection must be accompanied by "Keep Out" or "Tree Protection Area" signage. The area so fenced off shall not be used as a storage area or altered or disturbed except as may be permitted in this subsection (b).
(3)
Encroachment of construction within the protective barricade. The area so fenced off shall not be used as a storage area in connection with the development. Changes in grade or construction of impervious surfaces or utilities within the required protective barricade shall be permitted or prohibited subject to the following guidelines:
a.
In all circumstances, the minimum distance from the tree radius which cannot be encroached upon by soil disruption, trenching and general excavation will follow the 3:1 rule. For every three inches of dbh, a minimum of one foot of distance from the tree radius cannot be encroached upon, as measured from the outermost perimeter edge of tree's trunk. (For example: a tree with a nine-inch-dbh must have a minimum distance of three feet from the tree radius, which cannot be encroached upon.)
b.
Compaction of the soil within the protective barricade shall be avoided. No heavy equipment can be operated or parked within the protective barricade.
c.
All brush, earth and other debris shall be removed in a manner, which prevents injury to the protected tree. Oil, gas, chemicals or other substances that may be harmful to trees shall not be stored or dumped within the protective barricade of any protected tree.
d.
Construction of impervious surfaces shall not be permitted within the base of a protected, historic or specimen tree, unless special construction methods, including but not limited to tree feeders, porous paving materials and shell walks, are used and certified as acceptable by the authority's tree inspector.
(4)
All roots outside of the protective barricade to be removed during the development shall be severed clean and a two-inch-layer of mulch shall be applied over the surface or exposed roots during development if feasible.
(5)
Trenching. The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather then trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root-pruning procedures must be employed. Wherever feasible, trenching should occur in a radial direction to or from a tree in order to minimize damage to tree roots. In no circumstances will trenching be allowed within the critical root zone as defined by the 3:1 rule as explained in subsection (b)(3) of this section. Tunneling and selective excavation within this area is subject to approval by the tree inspector.
(6)
Grade changes. Moderate fill, no greater than six inches can be tolerated within a trees critical root zone without the prior installation of an aeration system. Commercially available aeration systems are subject to approval by the tree inspector.
(7)
Where the tree inspector has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced.
(8)
Remedial procedures. Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the tree's growing site, and that damage is repairable. If encroachment is anticipated or has happened, these cultural practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve survival. The following practices shall be applied where appropriate:
a.
Pruning. The pruning of a tree in anticipation of construction damage may provide compensation for potential root loss and produce an invigorating response. A tree that has suffered root damage becomes stressed, as that root system no longer provides sufficient water and nutrients for the existing crown. This stress becomes evident with the appearance of "staghorns" or deadwood within the tree crown. Once a tree has been construction damaged, it is advisable to delay pruning until deadwood becomes evident (one to three years). Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended. The removal of live plant tissue from a construction-damaged tree can accelerate the tree's decline. Pruning of root-severed trees may reduce the possibility of wind throw. Trees that have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for maintenance of the tree's health, appearance, and safety, utilizing acceptable arboricultural practices. Pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees shall apply. The pruning of all trees is subject to tree inspector approval. No tree limb greater than two inches in diameter shall be removed without written approval. Prior to engaging in such pruning activity, approval must be granted by the tree inspector in the form of a tree permit. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit.
b.
Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting root development. Information regarding appropriate fertilizers and application rates may be obtained from the state agricultural extension office.
c.
A tree's ability for adequate root development, and ultimately its chances for survival, is improved with reclamation of the growing site.
d.
Wherever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural grade. Unnecessary fill, compaction, erosion sedimentation, concrete washout, and construction debris should be removed. When machinery is required for site improvement, it is recommended that a "Bobcat" or similar lightweight rubber tire or rubber-tracked vehicle be used so as to minimize soil compaction. Compacted soil within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated. This is best accomplished with a two-inch diameter auger or a hydraulic air spade. If using an auger, holes should be drilled to a depth of six to 12 inches, approximately two to three feet apart and radiating outward from the tree's trunk in a bicycle spoke configuration. This aeration technique is also recommended for areas affected by minor fill or the sedimentation of erosion materials. The air exchange, nutrient and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments. This is best accomplished by backfilling holes with mineral amendments such as perlite, vermiculite, isolite, etc. A two- to three-inch layer of mulch material, such as pine straw, pine bark or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of trees on construction sites is extremely beneficial. These benefits include:
1.
Conservation of soil moisture.
2.
Reduced rainfall runoff and erosion.
3.
Reduced soil compaction from construction activities.
4.
Reduced competition from grasses and weeds.
5.
Increased soil fertility.
6.
Improved soil structure.
7.
Moderation of soil temperature, with a subsequent increase in root development activity.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 6)
Sec. 20-85. - Tree removal and replacement.
(a)
Prior to removing any existing live oak greater than two inches at dbh or any shade tree eight inches at dbh or greater (both native and nonnative species), or performing any major pruning or the removal of branches two inches in diameter or greater on such trees, a tree permit must be obtained from the tree inspector. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit.
(b)
Tree replacement required. Removal of each protected tree or significant tree or removal of branches two inches in diameter or greater without a written tree permit is a violation of this article and shall require replacement in caliper inches in equal dbh removed from the site.
(c)
All other replacement shall be calculated as follows:
(1)
Live oak (Quercus virginiana). Any size: requires a 1:1 caliper-inch replacement ratio for healthy trees in good condition, exhibiting only minor structural defects. Live oaks in extreme poor health, exhibiting significant structural defects, or posing a clear safety issue to persons or property, will require a minimum 2½- to three-inch dbh replacement, regardless of the overall size of the existing tree. Live oak trees in poor-fair condition will require up to a ½:1 caliper-inch ratio depending upon the overall structural integrity of the tree. All replacement trees must be live oak (Quercus virginiana) and a minimum of 2½ to three inches in dbh.
(2)
Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) 23-inch dbh or smaller. No replacement required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. In such circumstances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, every tree that is removed must be replaced with a 2½- to three-inch dbh native shade tree or slash pine.
(3)
Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) 24-inch dbh or larger. Replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger.
(4)
Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). 24-inch dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger.
(5)
Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(6)
Red bay (Persea borbonica). Eight inches of dbh or larger: no replacements are required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. Due to recent ambroisia red bay beetle attacks, replacing trees with another red bay is not suggested. In such instances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, all trees removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(7)
American holly (Ilex opaca). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(8)
Buckthorn (Sideroxylon tenax). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(9)
Cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto). Any size, no replacements are required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site or if the palm is historic. Historic cabbage palms planted within the historic district must be replaced on a palm for palm ratio. Cabbage palms are monocots and create only a fraction of the overall canopy of a mature shade tree. Cabbage palms can be used as a mitigation tree, but each cabbage palm planted will only count as one inch of dbh towards mitigation.
(10)
Nonhistoric trees. Miscellaneous oaks, exotic palms, invasive exotics, nonnative species, cedars and hardwoods 23 inches dbh or less: no replacements required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. In such instances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, every tree that is removed must be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(11)
Historic trees. Miscellaneous oaks, cedars and hardwoods 24 inches dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet.
(12)
Specimen trees. Typically 24-inch dbh or larger, but it can be smaller depending upon the specific plant species. A tree will only be designated as a specimen upon approval by the tree inspector, a certified arborist, or authorized agents. The tree must be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size, historic association or unique aesthetic value. The tree must be in good or fair condition (see section 20-95) in order to merit this designation. The leased property owner must attempt all reasonable efforts to design around the tree in its existing location prior to being given permission for its removal. All specimen trees permitted to be removed will require a 3:1 caliper-inch replacement.
(d)
During the planting process, the planting hole should be a minimum of twice the size of the tree's root ball and soil amenities added to the backfill material (see figure 2 in section 20-95). Also, every effort should be made to water the newly planted tree for the first growing year.
(e)
Replacement for commercial and residential sites. Replacement tree sizes shall be measured in caliper inches according to the American Nursery Stock Standards (ANSS) and total number of inches removed from site is measured at dbh (4½ feet) above the ground. All replacement trees must be grade A quality with a dominant leader and dense foliage and free from injury, pest, disease or nutritional disorders. All replacement trees must survive for at least five years; otherwise, the replacement trees must be replaced at the owner's expense.
(1)
Any healthy historic live oaks, which are to be removed, the replacements will be 100 percent of dbh inches removed. This is a 1:1 relationship.
(2)
Trees identified as a specimen tree, which are to be removed, the replacement will be at a 3:1 caliper-inch ratio.
(3)
Any nonhistoric live oak trees which are to be removed, regardless of size, the replacements will be a minimum of 2½ to three inches at dbh on a 1:1 relationship.
(4)
Replanting schedule standards. To prevent a monoculture among plantings, the authority shall require diversity in the plantings required (see section 20-92).
(5)
Approved list of native shade trees and prohibited invasive exotic tree species (see section 20-93).
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 7)
Sec. 20-86. - Relocation of mature trees.
The relocation of a mature tree is a labor and cost-intensive undertaking that may fail even under the best of conditions. However, mature trees may be relocated, providing the relocation meets all of the following criteria:
(1)
The leased property owner has made all reasonable efforts to design around the tree in the existing location.
(2)
The tree is in good condition for relocation, to be determined by a licensed arborist or the tree inspector.
(3)
There must be another suitable location for the tree on the leased property or other approved island location.
(4)
The future location must not require excessive removal of additional existing trees in good condition and/or healthy understory vegetation.
(5)
Trees shall only be dug and moved during the planting season, October 1 through June 1.
(6)
The leaseholder must employ a tree moving company that is approved by the tree inspector.
(7)
The applicant must submit a detailed tree care plan including both pre-move and post-move care specifications to be approved by the tree inspector.
(8)
The leaseholder is aware, that should the relocated tree die, mitigation planting will be required per section 20-85, tree removal and replacement.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 8)
Sec. 20-87. - Minimum required tree density.
(a)
Mitigation required. For all residential and commercial properties, mitigation will be required unless a minimum tree density of 100 caliper inches measured at dbh is maintained per acre of the leased property. No trees will be permitted to be removed unless the total amount of dbh caliper inches are mitigated to the leased property's existing tree density at a 1:1 caliper-inch ratio. Mitigation will be required even if the tree is diseased, structurally compromised or dies of natural causes. For most residential lots, this will equate to approximately 36 dbh caliper inches per leased property lot. Only native shade trees will be counted in order to determine the existing tree density on a leased property. Cabbage palms will only have a density value of one-inch dbh per tree. (For example: A leased property owner requests to remove an 18-inch dbh slash pine tree on a 0.38 acre parcel that has an existing tree density of 50 dbh caliper inches. The minimum required dbh caliper inches for this leased property is (0.38 acres times 100 inches equals 38 dbh caliper inches). Removing the 18-inch dbh slash pine will result in an overall density of 34 dbh caliper inches. Therefore, a minimum of six dbh caliper inches must be mitigated for this site.
(b)
Mitigation not required. For all residential and commercial properties, mitigation will not be required if a minimum tree density of 200 caliper inches measured at dbh is maintained per acre of the leased property unless the tree is a live oak, historic or protected tree. For most residential lots, this will equate to approximately 75 dbh caliper inches per leased property lot. Only native shade trees will be counted in order to determine the existing tree density on a leased property. Cabbage palms will only have a density value of one-inch dbh per tree.
(c)
Mandatory mitigation if removal does not meet minimum density. Tree replacement/mitigation will be mandatory for properties if the removal of any tree results in a property that does not meet this minimum tree density range. If the overall amount of dbh caliper inches that are removed results in a property with less than 200 caliper inches but greater than 100 caliper inches, the total number of caliper inches removed will not be required to be mitigated to meet the minimum tree density required of the leased property unless a healthy live oak in good condition is removed. Trees will be mitigated at a tree-tree ratio as opposed to 1-1 caliper inch ratio. For all other native tree species, including poor condition live oaks, each tree that is removed must be replaced with a minimum 2½- to three-inch dbh native shade tree or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet depending upon the tree species that is removed. Mitigation will be required even if the tree is diseased, structurally compromised or dies of natural causes. All tree replacement requirements shall comply with section 20-85, tree removal location and replacements. (For example: A leased property owner requests to remove an 22 dbh slash pine tree on a 0.38 acre parcel that has an existing tree density of 90 dbh caliper inches. The minimum required dbh caliper inches for this leased property is (0.38 acres times 200 inches equals 76 dbh caliper inches.) Removing the 18-inch dbh slash pine will result in an overall density of 68 dbh caliper inches. Therefore, a minimum of one 2½- to three-inch dbh per caliper-inch of tree must be mitigated for this site as opposed to mitigating the balance of six caliper inches as the overall density is still above the full mitigation minimum tree density of 100 caliper inches per acre or 38 dbh caliper inches for this leased property.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 9)
Sec. 20-88. - Submission of site plans.
(a)
Where application for a building permit is submitted to the county, a site plan for the development or improvement of any parcel of land shall be submitted to the island authority. The site plans shall show the following information:
(1)
The building site;
(2)
The buildable area;
(3)
The yard areas;
(4)
Proposed landscaping improvements;
(5)
A registered survey of all existing trees with a dbh greater than eight inches, including live oaks (Quercus virginiana) with a dbh of two inches or greater;
(6)
Designation of any historic trees (refer to section 20-78 for the definition of an historic tree) will be designated by the authority's tree inspector or a certified arborist;
(7)
Trees to be maintained within the buildable area and yard area with location for each to be shown with reasonable accuracy, the plan must show either existing contours or an existing spot elevation at the outer edge of the root flair and proposed grading if any is going to occur as a spot elevation or proposed contours;
(8)
Specifications for protection of trees to be maintained during development;
(9)
A tree replacement schedule showing the location, species and size of any replacement trees to be planted;
(10)
Specifications and/or provisions for maintenance and upkeep of trees upon completion of the project.
(b)
No building permit shall be issued until the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the tree inspector. The inspector shall tentatively approve, approve conditionally or disapprove the plan. If the plan is disapproved or approved conditionally, the reasons for such action shall be stated in writing and signed by the executive director of the authority. One copy of the reasons shall be retained by the authority, and one copy given to the applicant. On conditional approval, the tree inspector may require the applicant to resubmit the plan with all recommended changes before granting final approval.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 10)
Sec. 20-89. - Exceptions.
(a)
In the event that any tree shall be determined to be diseased, in a hazardous or dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, safety, or welfare, and requires immediate removal without delay, written authorization shall be given by the tree inspector or his designee and the tree removed. If the tree inspector cannot be reached immediately, digital photos must be taken of the hazardous tree prior to its removal. The digital photos can be submitted to the tree inspector or emailed to the authority. If the hazardous tree is a live oak, replacement with another 2½- to three-inch dbh live oak, on any agreed upon location of the leased parcel, will still be required. Historic trees and protected trees will also require mitigation as defined in section 20-85, tree removal and replacement.
(b)
During the period of an emergency, such as a tornado, hurricane, flood or any act of nature, the requirements of this article may be waived by the executive director or assignee. In such case, the cutting and removal of felled trees shall be permitted until such time the authority deemed it necessary.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 11)
Sec. 20-90. - Mitigation.
It is the policy of the authority that leaseholders who are granted a permit to remove an historic or specimen tree make every effort to mitigate for the loss of the tree by replanting replacement trees on their leased property. If the property will not reasonably sustain the number of replacement trees to satisfy the entire mitigation requirement through in-kind mitigation, a mitigation fee may be the only feasible option.
(1)
Mitigation fee. The mitigation fee to be paid shall be determined by the following formula: $200.00 multiplied times dbh (diameter at breast height of tree to be removed). The mitigation fee will be available to any property owner that is unable to provide in-kind mitigation on their leased property. Specimen tree mitigation fees will be $200.00 multiplied times dbh times three.
(2)
Funds from collected mitigation fees shall be expended only for the following purposes:
a.
In support of planting live oaks or other native shade trees on public property within the state park. Such expenditures may include the cost of purchasing and planting trees, planting amendments, and the cost of installing irrigation improvements.
b.
In support of the care, maintenance and preservation of existing native trees on public property. This would include the cost of fertilization, aeration of tree roots, and general tree structure maintenance such as dead wooding and pruning broken and structurally weak branches.
(3)
The authority shall prepare an annual report accounting for the balance in the tree maintenance fund and summarizing the use to which such funding was put during the preceding year.
(4)
The authority may also accept donations, grants or other sources for specific tree related activities such as a tree naming program.
(5)
In-kind mitigation. The property owner may elect to satisfy some or all of the mitigation requirements by planting new trees on his property. If in-kind mitigation is elected, the property owner must plant 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger replacement trees until the required mitigation number is reached or a reasonable number of replacement trees have been reached. Each replacement tree that is planted as in-kind mitigation will be deducted from the total mitigation fee at $200.00 per caliper inch. Where a property owner elects to satisfy some or all of the mitigation requirement through in-kind mitigation, the property owner shall do so with the understanding that the property owner will be responsible for protecting the health of the replacement trees (including the obligation to provide irrigation), that purposeful damaging or neglect of the replacement trees will be subject to fines and additional mitigation requirements.
(Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 12)
Sec. 20-91. - Appeals.
(a)
The island tree board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the tree inspector in the enforcement of this article, provided that such appeals must be submitted in writing on forms provided by the authority to the tree board within 30 days after the order, requirement, decision, or determination which is alleged to be made in error. The island tree board shall act upon the application as expeditiously as possible and shall notify the applicant within five days of the action taken.
(b)
The island tree board shall be comprised of:
(1)
At least one island authority staff member;
(2)
An acting member of the Jekyll Island Garden Club;
(3)
An acting member of the Jekyll Island Citizens' Association; and
(4)
The county extension agent.
(c)
Appeals shall only be granted for errors of interpretation or where the unique natural features of the site are such that application of these regulations would create an undue hardship to the leaseholder.
