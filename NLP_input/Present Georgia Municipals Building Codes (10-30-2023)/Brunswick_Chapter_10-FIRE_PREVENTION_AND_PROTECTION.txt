Fire marshal/fire inspector refers to an individual deputized by the State of Georgia Office of the Insurance Commissioner, state fire marshal's office as a "local state fire marshal."
High hazard means occupancies which include contents that are likely burn with extreme rapidity or intensity or are highly combustible or from which explosions are likely in the event of a fire; or toxic, noxious or corrosive materials; heat producing equipment. By way of example, this includes, but it is not limited to: dry cleaning fluid; gasoline, kerosene or diesel fuel; paints, lacquers, thinners, strippers, or solvents; photo processing chemicals; resins and epoxies for fiber glassing or other purposes; flammable gases (e.g., propane, butane, or other); compressed gases (oxygen or other); or pesticides or corrosive or toxic cleaning beyond such as are kept purely for on-premises housekeeping purposes.

Sec. 10-3. - Fire detection and suppression requirements.
(a)
All new commercial buildings shall be protected throughout with an approved monitored fire alarm system, as defined by this chapter.
(1)
For buildings less than 10,000 square feet constructed mainly for storage of products with limited life loss potential some flexibility may be allowed provided that either the following requirements of subsection 10-2 are met: High hazard, hazardous area, Life safety evaluation and Special hazard. In the event of any changes made that contribute to the hazard and reclassification of any contents within the occupancy, the owner shall notify the fire marshal's office in writing of such changes. Where more than two sprinklers are installed in a single area for protection, water flow detection shall be provided to sound the building fire alarm or to notify by a signal, any constantly attended location, such as PBX, security, or emergency room, at which the necessary correction shall be taken.
(2)
Building storing materials that are water reactive or may be more damaged by water fighting a fire than by a fire may be allowed a variance or allowed alternative methods of fire suppression upon petition to the fire marshal/fire inspector's office.
(3)
Additions to existing unprotected buildings where the additions totals less than 50 percent of the area of the building may be granted exemption by the fire marshal/fire inspector's office; provided, however, the addition must be separated by fire rated construction in accordance with building codes in the Glynn-Brunswick Area and is not required to be protected by some other applicable code.
(4)
Where the total area of all the reconstruction (the reconfiguration of a space that affects an exit or a corridor shared by more than a single tenant; or the reconfiguration of a space such that the rehabilitation work area is not permitted to be occupied because existing means of egress and fire protection systems, or their equivalent, are not in place or continuously maintained) included in a modification exceeds 50 percent of the area of the building; the work shall be considered as a reconstruction and shall comply with the requirements of the Life Safety Code NFPA 101 sections 43.6 for the applicable occupancy. On any one story with rehabilitation work areas involving over 50 percent of the area of the story, a sprinkler system shall be provided throughout the story in accordance with Life Safety Code NFPA 101 applicable to new construction for the occupancy.
(b)
All new multifamily residential structures and two-family dwellings/duplexes shall be protected throughout with an approved automatic fire suppression system.
(c)
Reserved.
(d)
There shall be early fire detection systems in all sections of all dwellings/dwelling units and all new construction. Existing buildings may have an approved battery operated smoke detector. The fire marshal/fire inspector's office may require a hard-wired detection system if battery operated detectors are not maintained according to manufacturers recommendations.
(e)
There shall be a fire detection system to meet NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code, as applicable, in all new occupancies of the following classifications that provide a sprinkler system: educational, health care, detention, daycare for children, elderly or handicapped, and group care homes. The system shall notify emergency forces when activated.
(f)
The owner is responsible for having the fire detection system required by the preceding subsection (e) inspected and tested in accordance with NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code.

(h)
In existing buildings, it is not always practical to strictly apply the provisions of the Life Safety Code NFPA 101. Physical limitations can cause the need for disproportionate effort or expense with little increase in life safety. In such cases, the authority having jurisdiction needs to be satisfied that reasonable life safety is insured. In existing buildings, it is intended that any conditions that represents a serious threat to life be mitigated by the application of appropriate safeguards. It is not intended to require modifications for conditions that do not represent a significant threat to life, even though such conditions are not literally in compliance with the Life Safety Code NFPA 101.
(i)
Renovation of existing buildings or structures may be exempted in part or in whole from any rule, regulation, code or standard by the enforcement agency under the following conditions.
(1)
All noted conditions hazardous to life, economic impact, or hazardous to the environment based on the provisions of applicable state and local standards or codes for existing buildings shall be corrected to a reasonable and realistic degree as determined by the authority having jurisdiction.

All planned business groups and high rise buildings shall comply with NFPA 1141, Standard for Fire Protection in Planned Building Groups. This standard applies to new planned business groups.
(1)
This standard applies to planned building groups in suburban and rural areas that the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) determines would be impacted by one or more of the following during a fire: limited water supply, limited fire department resources, extended fire department response time, delayed alarms, limited access, hazardous vegetation, unusual terrain, or unusual characteristics. 1.1.2* This standard applies to new planned building groups.
