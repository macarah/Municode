Editor's note— Ord. No. 17-04-307 , §§ 1—8, adopted April 10, 2017, did not specify manner of inclusion; hence, codification as div. 7, §§ 2-284—2-291 was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-284. - Creation.
There is hereby created the Milton Greenspace Advisory Committee ("MGAC") whose mission and purpose shall be to, "participate in the greenspace land selection and acquisition process in conjunction with city council and staff, to facilitate achievement of the objectives of the Greenspace Bond goals, to establish policies and procedures to govern the committee, and to assist city council and staff, on an as needed basis, with the financial oversight of the Greenspace Bond funds in relation to the land acquisition program" In addition, the MGAC shall use and consider certain criteria and factors in land acquisition decisions as resolved by the city council Resolution No. 16-08-379, dated August 15, 2016 and pursuant to the Greenspace Bond referendum ballot language approved by the majority of Milton voters voting in the November 8, 2016 election. MGAC is created via ordinance, and is therefore not subject to certain of the requirements of Section 4.11 of the Milton Charter (see, city Charter, section 4.11(b)), to specifically include the size limitations and appointment process requirements.
( Ord. No. 17-04-307 , § 1, 4-10-2017; Ord. No. 17-06-322 , § 1, 6-5-2017)
Sec. 2-285. - Membership.
MGAC shall consist of the following:
(1)
Seven members appointed by the mayor and city council;
(2)
A quorum for the conduct of business shall be (1) if membership is an odd number, a number that is one-half of the appointed membership rounded to the next whole number (i.e., if a seven-member committee, a quorum shall be four);
(3)
Recommendations as to MGAC members shall be received based upon an open nomination process by Milton citizens;
(4)
City staff shall review the pool of citizen applicants and shall undertake a culling process with due consideration given to the public policy objectives and considerations of the green space bond and as otherwise referenced in this ordinance; and, following that culling process city staff shall submit to the council a recommended list of qualified citizens. The city council shall take that list of qualified citizens under advisement and from that list formulate a proposed MGAC membership panel. The city council shall then make a motion to approve the entire membership panel in a single vote during an open meeting of the council. Because formulation of the proposed MGAC membership panel entails deliberations and discussions on the appointment of prospective city officials and officers, discussions as to those MGAC members to be appointed may occur in closed session. No vote of any kind regarding appointment will occur in closed session;
(5)
The slate of MGAC members must be approved by a majority vote of the council before commencing service;
(6)
Each MGAC member must swear an oath prior to commencement of service;
(7)
MGAC members must be at least 21 years old;
(8)
MGAC members are not required to reside in any specific council district, but must be residents of Milton, Georgia with at least one member from each district and all geographic areas of the City represented as best as possible;
(9)
MGAC members, following appointment and swearing, shall be subject to the City of Milton Ethics Code, and shall be considered "city officials" or "city officers" under section 2-798 of the Milton Code (defining a city officer as "any member of a board, commission, or authority appointed by the council, the city manager, and any other appointed officer of the City of Milton");
(10)
The city council may consider appointments to MGAC in executive session, as MGAC members are declared city officials or city officers. Any vote regarding appointment shall occur in open session;
(11)
The city council may remove a MGAC member, for convenience, upon majority vote of the council;
(12)
MGAC shall be subject to the State of Georgia Open Meetings Act, O.C.G.A. 50-14-1 et seq., which necessarily includes the right to enter into closed or executive session to discuss the potential acquisition of land;
(13)
No city council member shall enter into any closed or executive session of MGAC unless the executive session is a duly called joint executive session of MGAC and the city council. MGAC shall determine who is needed in executive session to properly conduct such meeting in a matter that is both effective and otherwise in conformance with the Open Meetings Act;
(14)
A MGAC member that misses more than three consecutive MGAC meetings, absent extenuating circumstances, shall be deemed automatically removed from MGAC and the city council shall forthwith nominate and approve a replacement member. Any such replacement member shall fulfill the remainder of the term of the member so removed and shall be entitled to all rights and privileges of any other MGAC member. Section 2-157(c) of the Milton City Code shall also be binding on MGAC; and
(15)
The city council shall retain the discretion, but not obligation, to authorize a per diem payment to MGAC for meeting attendance. Any such authorization must be approved by resolution approved by the city council. This authorization for compensation, set forth during the creation of the MGAC, is intended to fulfill the mandate of section 2-160 of the Milton City Code.

Members may be required to sign confidentiality agreements relating to proposed land transactions that are to be considered for acquisition by the city. Members must also be able to fulfill the time commitment required to serve on the MGAC. Members must be willing to agree with the goals of the Milton Greenspace Bond program and work towards achieving those goals for the best interests of the Milton community as a whole. Members of the MGAC shall undertake their respective duties in a volunteer capacity and shall not be compensated for any time or expenses associated with any assignment or function with respect to the MGAC, except for a potential per diem as set forth in section 2-285(15).

The initial term for MGAC members shall be randomly assigned by city staff, with one-half of the members having four-year terms, and the remaining members having three-year terms. Initial members shall be advised of their term. Following the initial term, upon reappointment or selection of a new member to fill an expired term, each member of MGAC shall thereafter have a four-year term.
