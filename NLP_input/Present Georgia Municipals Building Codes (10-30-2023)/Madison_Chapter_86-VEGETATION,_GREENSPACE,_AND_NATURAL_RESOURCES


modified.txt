Sec. 86-1. - Purpose and intent.
modified
The residents of Madison live in a blessed with a diverse and abundant cover of trees and vegetation which is of general aesthetic value to the city. This ecological diversity makes the city a desirable place for residents and visitors alike. The appearance of the city from the public ways contributes ecologically and aesthetically to the economic prosperity of the city and demonstrates pride in its natural heritage. However, the growth and development of the city oftentimes requires the removal of trees and other plant material, thereby contributing to the depletion of a most valuable natural resource. Therefore, it is necessary to protect, preserve and restore this valuable asset; and the city council declares the purposes and intent of this article to be as follows:
(1)
To aid in environmental balance by contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, and carbon dioxide reduction, and stormwater management, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement.
(2)
Help maintain the drainage holding capacity of land.
(3)
Prevent soil erosion.
(4)
Prevent streams, ditches, and other waterways from silting.
(5)
Moderate temperature extremes with natural tree cover.
(6)
Maintain moisture levels in the air.
(7)
Provide necessary and unique habitat for urban and suburban environs.
(8)
Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation.
(9)
Provide a natural setting and enhance the beauty of the city.
(10)
Safeguard and enhance property values, thereby protecting public and private investments.
(11)
Preserve the unique identity and environment of the city.
(12)
Conserve energy and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Therefore, in order to protect this valuable asset, the city council declares the purpose of this article shall be to provide for the establishment of the greenspace conservation commission and the protection, management, removal, and replacement of trees within the city. In doing so, the city prefers, whenever reasonably possible, to maintain existing tree canopy rather than replanting trees whose full benefits will not be realized for years if not decades. As such, the city encourages property owners to submit creative approaches that would protect existing tree canopy, to include heritage and/or other specimen trees, instead of removing these trees and replanting to the specifications detailed in this chapter.

Sec. 86-2. - Definitions.
modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Arborist means an experienced certified arborist in the care and maintenance of trees.
Basal area means the basal area of a tree is defined as the cross-sectional area (usually in square feet) of a single tree at breast height, or four and one-half feet above ground, the diameter of a tree at four and one-half feet above the ground is called diameter at breast height (dbH).
Buffer means any visual buffer or screening.
Buildable area means that portion of a lot on which a structure or improvements may be erected according to current zoning requirements.
Building means any structure having a roof supported by columns or walls that encloses a space and intended for the shelter, housing or enclosure of any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods or materials of any kind or nature or as further defined in the building codes of the city.
Canopy, shade, or overstory tree means at tree at least 20 feet in height although typically much taller which should never be planted under a power line or on other constricted spaces.
Canopy dripline means a vertical line extending from the outer edge of a tree's branch tips down to the ground.
cbh means circumference-at-breast-height, which is the tree trunk circumference (in inches) at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, then each trunk is measured as a separate unit, combined to provide the cbh for that tree.
Cover area means that area which falls within the dripline of any tree.
Critical root zone means the land area circular in shape and centered on the trunk of a tree, the radius of which circle is defined by the farthest canopy dripline, which should be left generally undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. As canopy for the same species of the same size and age of tree can vary due to trimming, disease, wind damage, and other factors, for purposes of protection, the critical root zone will be assumed to be a radius one foot from the trunk for each two and one-half inches of circumference-at-breast height (cbh) of an existing tree. For trees to be planted, the critical root zone will be that surface area determined as necessary for the establishment and growth of these trees and found in a table below.
Destroy means any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to decline and die within a period of two years, including, but not limited to, such damage inflicted upon a tree including the root system by the application of toxic substances, the operation of heavy machinery, the change of natural grade by excavation or filling the cover area or around the trunk of a tree, and damages from injury or from fire inflicted on trees which result in or permit pest infestation.
Developed property means property upon which a building, structure, pavement or other improvements have been placed.
Development area means, under an approved tree protection plan, the portion of a tract exempted from the tree protection zone; consisting of the area to be occupied by buildings, the area to be occupied by unenclosed accessory uses, and the area necessary to meet minimum parking requirements.
Greenspace means any area retained as permeable unpaved and undeveloped ground and dedicated to supporting vegetation, viewscapes, and open space.
Height means the height of mature specimens under favorable growing conditions. (If expressed as a range, the midpoint of the range is the average height and the bottom of the range is the minimum height.)
Invasive tree means any non-native species whose reproduction through seed, root sprouts, or other means aggressively occupies greenspaces to the detriment of those spaces.
Overstory tree (see canopy tree).
Problem tree means any species that creates or is likely to create ongoing environmental, health, or safety issues.
Public utility means any publicly, privately or cooperatively owned line, facility or system for producing, transmitting or distributing communications, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil products, water, steam, clay, waste, stormwater not connected with highway drainage and other similar services and commodities, including publicly owned fire, police, traffic signals and lighting systems, which directly or indirectly serve the public or any part of the public.
Shade tree means a broad-leaf tree having an average height at maturity of at least 20 feet and having a broad spread relative to its height (excluding trees with pyramidal, conical or columnar crowns) and a dense canopy, so as to provide shade to structures, plantings, or parking areas.
Site density requirement (sdr) is the cumulative number of overstory and understory trees required on non-exempt property when developed, uses changed, lot coverage increased by 50 percent or more, or additional structures added to a property.
Specimen tree means any tree in fair or better condition which:
(1)
Equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes (except as provided in subsection of this definition):
a.
Overstory trees, 69 inches cbh, e.g., oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, maple, pecan, ash, beech, blackgum, persimmon;

c.
Understory trees, 31 inches cbh, e.g., dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods;
(2)
Meets the following minimum standards:
a.
Life expectancy of greater than 15 years;
b.
A relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay or hollow, and less than 10 percent radial trunk dieback;
c.
No more than two major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only);
d.
Relatively uniformly balanced and branched crown with no more than 70 percent of crown branches on one side of the trunk;
e.
Root systems with obvious, structurally sound root collars lying above native soil levels and at least six and one-eight square feet of open soil surface areas per inch of trunk basal area with root plate wholly within undisturbed area;
f.
No major insect or pathological problem;
g.
If lesser sized, is a rare or unusual species or of historical importance.
Specimen tree stand means a contiguous grouping of trees which is of high value because it is a:
(1)
Relatively mature, even-aged stand of at least four trees;
(2)
Stand with uniform native species composition or of a rare or unusual nature;
(3)
Stand of historical significance;
(4)
Stand with exceptional aesthetic qualities;
(5)
Meets health and structural requirements for specimen trees.
Tree means any self-supporting woody perennial plant, usually with one main stem or trunk and many branches, which has a trunk diameter of two inches or more measured at a point six inches above ground level and which normally attains a height of at least 15 feet at maturity.
Tree, large, means a tree with a height at maturity of 40 feet or more, also considered an overstory sized tree.
Tree, medium means a tree with a height at maturity of 20 to 40 feet, also considered an understory sized tree.
Tree, small, means a tree with a height at maturity of not more than 20 feet, also considered an understory sized tree.
Tree protection plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained or new trees planted in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the types of trees, their circumference at breast height four and one-half feet above grade.
Tree protection zone means the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival and is protected within the guidelines of this chapter.
Understory tree means a mature tree usually of 15 to 20 feet in height especially appropriate for planting under power lines and in restricted spaces.
Undeveloped property means property upon which no building, structure, pavement or other improvements have been placed.
Yard area means a greenspace minimally or undeveloped on the same lot with a building.

( Amd. of 11-8-2021 , § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 86-6. - Tree protection measures and plan.
modified
(a)
Tree protection measures. The tree protection zone (critical root zone: see definitions section 86-2.) for an existing tree as part of site density requirement (sdr) is a reasonably circular area centered on the tree, determined using a one foot radius from the trunk for every two and one-half inches of circumference at breast height (cbh). For trees planted to meet the sdr, the minimum tree protection zone is as follows:
(1)
Small trees (under 20 feet in height at maturity), 150 square feet, roughly a 14 feet diameter circle;
(2)
Medium trees (20 to 40 feet in height at maturity), 400 square feet, roughly a 22 feet diameter circle;
(3)
Large trees (greater than 40 feet in height at maturity), 900 square feet, roughly a 34 feet diameter circle.
In the tree protection zone, the following protective measures shall be applied to the aboveground portion of a tree part of the sdr and to its roots within the critical root zone, specifically not encompassing where they extend into adjacent property or where those on adjacent property extend into the subject parcel:
(4)
Damage prohibited. No person shall:
a.
Cut, carve, transplant, or otherwise damage or remove any protected tree beyond routine trimming and maintenance, or as provided elsewhere in this chapter;
b.
Attach anything to a tree which would destroy or damage that tree as defined in this chapter;
c.
Allow any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which is harmful to trees (such as concrete washout, fuel, lubricants, injurious herbicides, paint) to come in contact with them or; within the critical root zone (crz).
d.
Set a fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat of the fire will injure any portion of any tree.
(5)
Fence required. During excavation, filling, construction or demolition operations, each tree or stand of trees part of tree density requirements shall be protected against damage to bark, roots and low-hanging branches with a tree protection or silt fence enclosing the critical root zone.
(6)
Compaction prohibited. All buildings materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or aboveground damage shall be kept outside the critical root zone. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, the critical root zone shall first be mulched with a four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw.
(7)
Grade changes prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the critical root zone. Stripping of topsoil in the critical root zone shall not be permitted. Where necessary, the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system approved by the designated city official. Deposition of sediment in the critical root zone shall be prevented by placement of sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two inch by four inch wire mesh in areas of steep slope.
(8)
Ditches, trenches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch, tunnel or trench within the critical root zone of an existing protected tree. Where such encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the designated city official, tunneling rather than trenching should be used. If roots must be cut, root pruning procedures approved by the designated city official must be employed. For newly planted trees, trenching is allowed within a five foot radius or at two feet outside its root ball, whichever is greater.
(9)
Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt or other impervious material within the critical root zone except as approved by the designated city official.
(b)
Tree protection plan.
(1)
A proposal for the development, clearing, additional lot coverage in excess of 50 percent of existing, or improvement on any tract of land shall include a protection plan for trees to be retained or planted in order to meet the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(2)
Tree protection plans may be submitted for approval on tracts of land for which there is no proposal for development, clearing, or improvement if the owner chooses to do so voluntarily. For example, this may be done if such property has boundary trees that need to be protected from development on adjacent properties; to meet in advance minimum tree requirements if the property is ever developed, cleared, or improved; or to increase the likelihood of noteworthy trees being protected when the property is sold.
(3)
The tree protection plan may be included with a building permit application or in the soil erosion and sediment control plan and will be reviewed concurrently with those submissions; see chapter 38.
(4)
The proposed or previously approved tree protection plan shall be submitted to the designated city official for review and approval prior to any grading, bulldozing or other removal of the existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage on non-exempt properties.
(5)
An applicant can appeal a denial by the designated city official of the submitted tree protections plan to the greenspace conservation commission and, if desired, to the city council if denied by the commission.
(6)
The details shall include the following in a landscape architectural design plan:
a.
Names and addresses of the owner of record and the applicant.
b.
Boundary lines of the tract by lengths and bearings, streets adjoining the property, total area of the tract, north point, graphic scale, and date.
c.
All existing specimen trees, including those proposed to be removed, and all trees which are submitted for credit under this section. The owner of the property shall indicate the common names and the size of each tree so included. In heavily wooded areas that will not be disturbed, the site plan may show only the boundaries of each stand of trees to be protected.
d.
Locations of proposed buildings, structures and paved areas.
e.
Locations of all utility lines. New utility lines should be placed along corridors between critical root zones of trees which will remain on the site.
f.
Limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching.
g.
Limits of tree protection areas, showing trees to be maintained and planted, specifying their name, size, and critical root zone.
h.
Grade changes or other work adjacent to a tree which would affect it adversely, with drawings or descriptions as to how the grade, drainage and aeration will be maintained around the tree.
i.
Planting schedule, i.e., when any required new trees will be planted.
(c)
Determination of density requirement (site, existing, and replacement).
(1)
Credit for existing tree. An existing overstory or understory tree of the required diameter (31.5 cbh for overstory, 12.5 cbh for understory) is credited as two trees of the same type if it is to be protected and included as part of the site density requirement, and surviving in good health for at least two years following completion of disturbance.
(2)
Credit for specimen tree. A specimen tree retained of any type is credited as three trees of any type if it is to be protected and included as part of the site density requirement and surviving in good health for at least two years following completion of disturbance.
(3)
No credit shall be given for any tree on the greenspace conservation commission list of non-recommended trees
(d)
Application of density requirements to the plan.
(1)
Required planting areas shall be as follows:
a.
The tree protection area shall include at least strips of the following depths adjacent to property lines (plus strips required by buffer or landscape requirements elsewhere in the zoning code), permitting only the encroachment of driveways necessary to serve the property. Trees in these strips may qualify towards trees required to meet the site density requirement.
EXPAND
Lot Width/Depth Side Boundary Rear Boundary
≤100 feet 10 feet 10 feet
101—150 15 feet 15 feet
≥151 feet 20 feet 20 feet
  b.
No tree shall be planted closer to a building foundation or water, sewer, electrical or natural gas line than as follows:
1.
For a mature understory tree (less than 20 feet in height), five feet.
2.
For a mature medium tree (20 to 40 feet in height), ten feet.
3.
For a mature canopy tree (greater than 40 feet in height), 15 feet.
c.
No tree shall be planted under overhead utility distribution lines if the typical mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire, or be no greater size than a small tree (section 86-2).
(2)
Criteria for selection of and planting required trees shall be as follows:
a.
A guide for choosing qualifying species is available from the city. Provided a tree is non-invasive, non-qualifying species may be planted but do not count toward the numbers of overstory and understory trees needed to meet the site development requirement.
b.
The minimum cbh of overstory trees to be planted is six and three-eighth (6.375) inches; for understory tree, three and one-eighth (3.125) inches.
c.
Spacing and the mature size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site.
d.
Where trees must be added to achieve the total density requirement, such additions shall be made between the street and the front of the building until such additions comprise at least one quarter of the total site density requirement.
e.
The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site, e.g., wetland, upland, development density, site coverage
f.
Authority for questions of tree characteristics shall be publications of the state forestry commission; publications of the cooperative extension service of the University of Georgia College of Agriculture and its schools of Design and Urban Forestry; Handbook of Trees of Georgia and Adjacent States (Brown & Kirkman, Timber Press, 1990); or other authority acceptable to the city.
g.
Trees required to meet minimum site requirements (sdr) should be planted as per Community Tree Planting and Establishment Guidelines published by the Georgia Forestry Commission.
(3)
For specimen vs. non-specimen trees, emphasis should be given to the preservation of specimen trees, even isolated individual trees, over retention of other trees. For property over two acres, consideration should be given to preserving non-specimen trees in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site.
(4)
The property owner shall maintain trees on the property in accordance with this article and the approved plan, including replacing trees which die or are irreparably damaged.
( Amd. of 11-8-2021 , § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 86-7. - Easement.
modified
The mayor and city council are authorized to enter into agreements with the owners of private property located within the city for the purpose of acquiring easements to plant trees on such property, in consideration for which the private property owner shall acquire ownership of such trees as the city may plant; however, any such agreement shall limit the duration of the easement to a time period of two years and shall limit the property interest acquired by the city to that distance sufficient to allow the planting of trees, in no case to exceed a maximum of a 15-foot setback from the property line or right-of-way held by the city. Under such agreement the private property owner shall agree to maintain the trees planted on his property and shall also agree to hold the city harmless for any liability attributable to the planting or presence of the trees on the private property.
( Amd. of 11-8-2021 , § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 86-8. - Permits.
modified
(a)
A permit shall be required to remove or cause the death of trees located on the tree protection plan designated for meeting site density requirements; for substantially clearing property of its trees; or for grading or other work within a tree protection zone for a tree needed to meet site density requirements. An approved tree protection plan is required for issuance of a permit.
(b)
Exceptions to permit requirements are as follows:
(1)
Permits are not required by public utility companies and government agencies for the conduct of operations having the purpose of assuring uninterrupted utility and governmental services and unobstructed passage on public rights-of-way.
(2)
Permit requirements are waived if trees to be removed are dead or have been damaged by lightning, wind, ice or other disasters to the extent that public safety is endangered.
(3)
Trees smaller than those indicated in section 86-5(c)(6) which do not reduce remaining qualifying trees below the site density requirement.
(4)
Invasive or prohibited trees included on greenspace conservation commission list.
(5)
No development is proposed on the property and the designated city official can easily observe that remaining tree cover will exceed the site density requirement once the proposed trees are removed.
( Amd. of 11-8-2021 , § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 86-9. - Enforcement.
modified
The city manager shall have the power to promulgate and enforce rules, regulations and specifications concerning the trimming, spraying, removal, planting, pruning and protection of trees upon the right-of-way of any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place in the city and in areas described in the tree protection zone as set down under section 86-5.

modified
(a)
Violations.
(1)
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued pursuant to provisions of this chapter, upon being found guilty of a violation, shall be subject to section 1-12. Each day during which any violation of the provisions of this section shall occur or continue shall be a separate offense.
(2)
If as the result of the violation of any provision of this article the injury, mutilation or death of a tree located on city-owned property is caused, the cost of repair or replacement of such tree, shrub or other plant shall be borne by the party in violation. The replacement value of trees shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision of A Guide to the Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, and Evergreens, as published by the International Society of Arboriculture.
(b)
Assessment of claim. If a nuisance (down or unsafe tree) is not abated by the date specified in the notice, the city manager is authorized to cause the abatement of the nuisance. The reasonable cost of such abatement shall be filed as a lien against the property on which the nuisance was located. In addition, the owner of the property upon which the nuisance was located shall be subject to prosecution.
(c)
Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any action of the city manager or the greenspace conservation commission may appeal such recommendation to the mayor and city council. The appeal must be filed with the city clerk within 30 days after the decision is rendered. The city may approve, modify or reject the decision made by the city manager or greenspace conservation commission if the mayor and council finds that the city manager or the greenspace conservation commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city made pursuant to this subsection may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law from convictions for municipal ordinance violations.
( Amd. of 11-8-2021 , § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 86-11. - Alternative compliance measures.
modified
Due to the uniqueness of land, natural resources, and individual parcels, alternative compliance measures are provided for property owners who cannot meet the requirements of this chapter as delineated above.
(a)
Alternative compliance measures include:
(1)
Tree Trust Fund. Property owners who cannot reasonably protect or replace trees as required above may pay into the Tree Trust Fund. A fee of $200.00 for an understory tree and $400.00 for an overstory tree will be charged for every tree under the site density requirement which cannot be planted or protected. This fee covers the cost of securing a suitable tree, associated planting costs, and the securing of land so that a substitute tree can be planted elsewhere. This fee shall be adjusted annually by the U.S. Consumer Price Index at the discretion of the city.
(2)
Proximity planting. Off-site planting of required trees section 86-5(a) of this chapter if property is located within 1,000 feet of the applicant's property and these trees shall not be counted towards the site density requirement of the substitute site but shall become a permanent additional requirement for that site.
(3)
Other method as approved by the greenspace conservation commission.
(b)
The application process for alternative compliance measures is as follows:
(1)
Applications and guidelines for receiving approval can be found at the city planning office and on the city website
(2)
Applicant shall pay the then current review fee and attach payment to the application at submission.
(3)
The designated public official will review and approve or deny applications within one week of receipt.
(4)
Any appeals to decisions of designated public official may be appealed further to the city council.

Sec. 86-12. - Harvesting and selective cutting of trees.
new
(a)
Purpose and intent. To provide for the regulation of such activity to ensure:
(1)
That the right to harvest trees is exercised with due regard for the protection of the physical property of adjacent landowners; and
(2)
That the potential for negative environmental and aesthetic impacts resulting from improper tree harvesting and wholesale cutting of trees is minimized;
(3)
That in accordance with agricultural and forestry practices, to provide for alternative regulations in this section for legitimate tree harvesting and selective cutting operations.
(b)
Definitions. The following words are defined as they are used in this section:
Operator means the individual, partnership, company, firm, association or corporation engaged in the harvest of timber, including his agents or subcontractors or employees.
Owner means the individual, partnership, company, firm, association or corporation which holds title to standing timber and to the land on which it is situated, including his agents or subcontractor or employees.
Perimeter buffer means a defined setback from the property line in which, except as necessary for ingress/egress, no cutting of any tree or vegetation shall occur in order to mitigate visual and other negative impacts associated with tree harvesting and selective cutting practices.
Selective cutting means the selective removal and cutting down of trees and logs for the improvement of forest health as a best management practice.
Tree harvesting (also timber harvesting/logging), as an agricultural practice, means the wholesale removal and cutting down of trees and logs to be converted to any forest product or for sale to others or for any other reason.
Tree harvesting plan means a written description with a map of a specific logging operation prepared before the operation commences.
(c)
Applicability. The provisions and requirements of this section shall apply to all tree harvesting and selective cutting operations on properties with more than three acres except those properties exempt from the tree ordinance under section 86-5. Properties with fewer than three acres shall remain subject to all other sections of the tree ordinance.
(d)
Responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of each operator and landowner on whose land tree harvesting or selective cutting of trees is to be carried out to develop or have developed the tree harvesting plan, and submit notification and said plan as required in this section. It shall be the joint responsibility of the landowner and the operator to see that they carry out the provisions of the tree harvesting plan, and both shall be subject to penalty for violations of said plan.
(e)
Regulations.
(1)
Tree harvesting. Full removal of the mature timber shall be permitted for properties locally registered in the Georgia Current Use Valuation Act (CUVA) and Forest Land Protection Act (FLPA) programs, provided that a perimeter buffer of no less than 50 feet is retained. If the property is not registered under CUVA or FLPA but is owned by a commercial timber producer, i.e., a commercial tree harvesting plan for the property has been filed by the owner and approved, can also remove all mature timber provided that (1) a perimeter buffer of no less than 50 feet is retained and (2) no development of the property occurs for five years after harvest.
(2)
Selective cutting. Selective cutting shall occur only when basal area reaches 120 or higher, allowing a reduction of basal area to no less than 60 basal area, provided that a perimeter buffer of no less than 25 feet be retained.
(f)
Tree harvesting plan requirements.
(1)
