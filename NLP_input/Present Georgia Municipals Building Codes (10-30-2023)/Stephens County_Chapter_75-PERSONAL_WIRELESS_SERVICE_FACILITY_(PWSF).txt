ARTICLE IX. - PERMIT (LEVEL III) NEW NON-CONCEALED PWSF TOWERS

Sec. 75-66. - Development standards.
(a)
(1)
Determination of need. No new non-concealed PWSF shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that no existing tower can accommodate the applicant's proposed use; or that use of such existing facilities would prohibit personal wireless services in the geographic search area to be served by the proposed tower.
(2)
Height. Height calculations shall include above ground foundations, but exclude lightning rods or lights required by the FAA that do not provide any support for antennas. It is intended that all new non-broadcasting non-concealed PWSF towers be 120 feet or less in height. However, should a non-concealed PWSF tower applicant for a site located in a non-residential zoning district adequately demonstrate that a height in excess of 120 feet is required to provide service, under no circumstance shall any non-concealed PWSF tower in a non-residential zoning district exceed 199 feet.
(3)
Setbacks. New non-concealed PWSFs and equipment compounds shall be subject to the setbacks described below for breakpoint technology:
a.
If the non-concealed PWSF tower is constructed using breakpoint design technology (see "definitions"), the minimum setback distance shall be equal to 110 percent of the distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint level of the structure, or the minimum side and rear yard requirements, whichever is greater. Certification by a registered professional engineer licensed by the State of Georgia of the breakpoint design and the design's fall radius must be provided together with the other information required herein from an applicant. (For example, on a 100-foot-tall monopole with a breakpoint at 80 feet, the minimum setback distance would be 22 feet (110 percent of 20 feet, the distance from the top of the monopole to the breakpoint) plus the minimum side or rear yard setback requirements for that zoning district).
b.
If the non-concealed PWSF tower is not constructed using breakpoint design technology, the minimum setback distance shall be equal to the height of the proposed PWSF.
(4)
Equipment cabinets and equipment shelters. Electronic equipment shall be contained in either (a) equipment cabinets or (b) equipment shelters. Equipment cabinets shall not be visible from pedestrian and right-of-way views. Equipment cabinets may be provided within the principal building, behind a screen on a rooftop, or on the ground within the fenced-in and screened equipment compound.
