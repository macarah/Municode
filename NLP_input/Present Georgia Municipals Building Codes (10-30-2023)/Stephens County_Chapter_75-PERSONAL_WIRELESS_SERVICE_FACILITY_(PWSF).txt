(Ord. of 3-10-2015)
Sec. 75-2. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the locating of personal wireless service facilities ("PWSF") and their component parts, including but not limited to towers, antenna[s], ground equipment and related accessory structures. The purposes and intent of this chapter are to:
(1)
Promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by regulating the locating of telecommunication facilities.
(2)
Minimize the impacts of PWSFs on surrounding land uses by establishing standards for location, structural integrity, and compatibility.
(3)
Encourage the location and collocation of PWSF equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual, aesthetic, and public safety impacts, effects upon the natural environment and wildlife, and to reduce the need for additional towers.
(4)
Accommodate the growing need and demand for PWSF services.
(5)
Encourage coordination between suppliers and providers of PWSF services.
(6)
Establish predictable and balanced codes governing the construction and location of PWSF within the confines of permissible local regulations.
(7)
Establish review procedures to ensure that applications for PWSF are reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable period of time as required by applicable state and federal regulations.
(8)
Respond to the policies embodied in the Telecommunications Act of 1996; The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, and other applicable federal and state regulations in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services.
(9)
Protect the character of the county while meeting the needs of its citizens to enjoy the benefits of PWSF.
(10)
Encourage the use of public lands, buildings, and structures as locations for PWSF demonstrating concealed technologies and revenue generating methodologies.

Towers do not include any device used to attach antennas to an existing building, unless the device extends above the highest point of the building by more than 20 feet. Types of towers include the following:
Guyed tower means a style of tower consisting of a single truss assembly composed of sections with bracing incorporated. The sections are attached to each other, and the assembly is attached to a foundation and supported by a series of wires that are connected to anchors placed in the ground or on a building.

Monopole structure means a style of freestanding tower consisting of a single shaft usually composed of two or more hollow sections that are in turn attached to a foundation. This type of tower is designed to support itself without the use of guy wires or other stabilization devices. These facilities are mounted to a foundation that rests on or in the ground or on a building's roof. All feed lines shall be installed within the shaft of the structure.
Tower base means the foundation, usually concrete, on which the tower and other support equipment are situated. For measurement calculations, the tower base is that point on the foundation reached by dropping a perpendicular weight from the geometric center of the tower.
Tower height means the vertical distance measured from the grade line to the highest point of the tower, including any antenna, lighting or other equipment affixed thereto.
Tower site means the land area that contains, or will contain, a proposed tower, support structures and other related buildings and improvements.
Variance means a modification of the terms of this chapter where a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in an unnecessary site specific hardship and shall be recommended by the planning director and reviewed and issued by the board of county commissioners.

(3)
The equipment cabinet shall be subject to the setback requirements of the underlying zoning district. The setback waiver form from all adjoining land owners with structures within the applicable setbacks will waive these setback requirements.
(4)
When a PWSF collocated or combined antenna is to be located on a nonconforming building or structure, then the existing permitted nonconforming setback shall prevail.

ARTICLE IX. - PERMIT (LEVEL III) NEW NON-CONCEALED PWSF TOWERS

Sec. 75-66. - Development standards.
(a)
(1)
Determination of need. No new non-concealed PWSF shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that no existing tower can accommodate the applicant's proposed use; or that use of such existing facilities would prohibit personal wireless services in the geographic search area to be served by the proposed tower.
(2)
Height. Height calculations shall include above ground foundations, but exclude lightning rods or lights required by the FAA that do not provide any support for antennas. It is intended that all new non-broadcasting non-concealed PWSF towers be 120 feet or less in height. However, should a non-concealed PWSF tower applicant for a site located in a non-residential zoning district adequately demonstrate that a height in excess of 120 feet is required to provide service, under no circumstance shall any non-concealed PWSF tower in a non-residential zoning district exceed 199 feet.
(3)
Setbacks. New non-concealed PWSFs and equipment compounds shall be subject to the setbacks described below for breakpoint technology:
a.
If the non-concealed PWSF tower is constructed using breakpoint design technology (see "definitions"), the minimum setback distance shall be equal to 110 percent of the distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint level of the structure, or the minimum side and rear yard requirements, whichever is greater. Certification by a registered professional engineer licensed by the State of Georgia of the breakpoint design and the design's fall radius must be provided together with the other information required herein from an applicant. (For example, on a 100-foot-tall monopole with a breakpoint at 80 feet, the minimum setback distance would be 22 feet (110 percent of 20 feet, the distance from the top of the monopole to the breakpoint) plus the minimum side or rear yard setback requirements for that zoning district).
b.
If the non-concealed PWSF tower is not constructed using breakpoint design technology, the minimum setback distance shall be equal to the height of the proposed PWSF.
(4)
Equipment cabinets and equipment shelters. Electronic equipment shall be contained in either (a) equipment cabinets or (b) equipment shelters. Equipment cabinets shall not be visible from pedestrian and right-of-way views. Equipment cabinets may be provided within the principal building, behind a screen on a rooftop, or on the ground within the fenced-in and screened equipment compound.
(5)
Fencing. All equipment compounds shall be enclosed with an opaque fence or masonry wall in residential zoning districts, and in any zoning district when the equipment compound adjoins a public right-of-way. Alternative equivalent screening may be approved through the site plan approval process.
(6)
Buffer. The equipment compound shall be landscaped with a minimum ten-foot-wide perimeter buffer containing the following planting standards:
a.
All plants and trees shall be indigenous to this part of Georgia.
b.
Existing trees and shrubs on the site should be preserved and may be used in lieu of required landscaping as approved by the planning department.
c.
One row of evergreen trees with a minimum two-inch caliper, 25-foot on center.
d.
Evergreen shrubs capable of creating a continuous hedge and obtaining a height of at least five feet shall be planted, minimum three-gallon or 24 inches tall at the time of planting, five-foot on center.
e.
Alternative landscaping plans which provide for the same average canopy and understory trees but propose alternative locating on the entire subject property may be considered and approved by the planning department, provided the proposed alternative maximizes screening as provided above, and is otherwise consistent with the requirements of this section.
(7)
Signage. Commercial messages shall not be displayed on any non-concealed PWSF tower. Required noncommercial signage shall be subject to the following:
a.
The only signage that is permitted upon a non-concealed PWSF tower, equipment cabinets, shelters or fence shall be informational, and for the purpose of identifying the PWSF (such as ASR registration number), as well as the party responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility, and any additional security and/or safety signs as applicable.
b.
If more than 220 voltage is necessary for the operation of the facility and is present in a ground grid or in the tower, signs located every 20 feet and attached to the fence or wall shall display in large, bold, high contrast letters, minimum height of each letter four inches, the following: "HIGH VOLTAGE - DANGER."
c.
