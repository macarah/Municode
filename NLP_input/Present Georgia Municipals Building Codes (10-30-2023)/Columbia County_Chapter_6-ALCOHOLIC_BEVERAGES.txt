(d)
Duty of successors or assignees of licensee to withhold tax from purchase money. If any licensee liable for any amount under sections 6-151—6-156 sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the director showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.

Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase price as required, he becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price valued in money. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the director shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address, as it appears on the records of the director, of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever occurs later.
(f)
Refund of tax, penalty or interest paid more than once or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under sections 6-151—6-156, it may be offset as provided in subsection 6-154(c) or it may be refunded provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the director within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the director. If the claim is approved by the director and the board of commissioners, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person, his administrators or executors.
