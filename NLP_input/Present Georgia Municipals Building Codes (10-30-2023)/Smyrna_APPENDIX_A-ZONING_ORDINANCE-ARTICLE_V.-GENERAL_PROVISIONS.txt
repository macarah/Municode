Such buffer strip shall consist of a planted earthen berm or planted strip, including trees, shrubs, stone, rocks, and other appropriate landscaping materials, and shall be at least ten feet in width for developments of five acres or less; and at least 50 feet in width for developments of five acres or greater, 40 feet of which may be a "natural" buffer area.
Such plantings shall be composed of evergreen trees and shrubs not less than six feet in height or trees and shrubs which will, in normal growing conditions, attain a height of six feet within three years; earthen berms shall be not less than six feet in height. In order to provide and form a hardy screen of sufficient density and height to both interrupt vision and diffuse the transmission of sound, all plants used must be first submitted to and approved by the building inspector, including but not limited to the following acceptable plants:
Slash or Loblolly Pines
Prunus Caroliniana (Cherry Laurel)
Red Tip Photinia

Said strip shall be planted and maintained in a healthy, growing condition by the property owner. No such buffer strip shall, however, extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than 12 feet.
Where the conditions described in the preceding paragraph cannot be met, with respect to the required ten-foot buffer strip, the owner of said buffer area may erect a permanent or opaque fence not less than six feet in height.
Except as provided above, the natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion; provided such easement shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvements.
Such buffer strip shall not be used for parking or a structure other than a fence, wall or drainage improvements required by the city. However, a buffer area may be used for utility easements (only if such uses are provided approximately perpendicular to the greater distance of the buffer area) and for drainage improvements required by the city based upon competent engineering studies which show improvements to be necessary, to the satisfaction of the mayor and council.
