(Min. of 11-10-2016, § 12.3)
Sec. 47-272. - General provisions.
(a)
Special use required. A special use permit shall be required for the placement of any tower or alternative tower structure, except as otherwise permitted herein. Procedures for special use permits sought under this article are contained in section 47-273.
(b)
Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure.
(c)
Co-location of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of a tower or antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure, if possible. An exception to co-location shall only be made if the applicant submits a report from an engineer demonstrating that an existing tower suitable for co-location does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available, or if the applicant submits an affidavit showing that while a suitable tower may exist, no space is available thereon. Co-location is permissible provided the new antenna will add no more than ten feet to the height of the tower and related equipment or appurtenances. Increasing the antenna height more than ten feet requires a special use permit. Co-location requires only a building permit, and the information described in section 47-275(b).
(Min. of 11-10-2016, § 12.4)

(5)
The requirement of subsection (a)(4) of this section may be waived by the adjacent property owner. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a notarized affidavit from the adjacent owner, identifying the property owned, and affirming that he agrees that the tower can be erected at the proposed location, which shall be specifically described, including its distance from that owner's residential dwelling. The affidavit shall further specifically state that the affiant understands that he or she is waiving his rights under this subsection. Waivers shall be required of all property owners whose dwellings are located within 1,000 feet of the proposed tower.
(b)
Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article and shall be approved by the director.
(1)
Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(3)
For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from the sunset to sunrise.
(5)
No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the city.
(6)
To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
(7)
Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land.
(8)
Such other additional requirements as the director shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
(c)
Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative.
(d)

Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
(2)
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
(3)
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the director to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article.
(4)
Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas, shall not be subject to the provision of this subsection unless required by the city through the special use permit process.
(e)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible.
(f)
Review of tower and antenna erection by the airport authority. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this article, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the use of the airways of the city by the public or interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the department to the Cartersville-Bartow County Airport Authority for review and recommendation.
(g)
Federal requirements; removal of towers. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in the city unfit property ordinance then in effect.
(h)
Building codes; safety standards; removal of towers. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable standard building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in the city unfit property ordinance. Prior to the removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above-referenced compliance period. Abandoned towers or towers deemed unsafe may also be removed under the city unfit property ordinance procedures.
(i)
Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within 30 days.
