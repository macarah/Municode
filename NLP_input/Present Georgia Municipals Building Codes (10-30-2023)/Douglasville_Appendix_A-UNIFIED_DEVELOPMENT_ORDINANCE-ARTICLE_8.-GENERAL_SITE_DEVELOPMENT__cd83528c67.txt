ARTICLE 8. - GENERAL SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 8.01. - Off-street parking and loading.
modified
A.
Purpose. It is the purpose of these off-street parking and loading regulations to:
1.
Reduce the congestion on streets due to excessive use for parking and loading of motor vehicles;
2.
To prevent excessive amounts of off-street parking and loading through the appropriate control of the siting and number of spaces permitted.
3.
To prevent traffic congestion and hazard due to the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on private property.
These requirements apply uniformly to all buildings and uses, regardless of the districts in which they are located.
B.
Vehicle parking; when required. Off-street parking and/or loading shall be provided for every new, enlarged or modified building or use in connection with every use as applicable, in accordance with the requirements specified in this section.
C.
Number of parking spaces to be provided.
1.
At the applicant's option, parking spaces may be provided in accordance with the guidelines contained in this section. The guidelines establish the minimum number of spaces to be provided. An increase or decrease in the number of spaces can only be allowed through approval of an alternate parking plan.
2.
The number of parking spaces to be provided for a particular use or development may be established through administrative approval of an alternate parking plan. Use of an alternate parking plan is encouraged in order to tailor the parking to the particular needs of the use or development and to allow introduction of operational solutions such as ride-sharing programs or remote employee parking lots.
3.
Downtown area exemption. Off-street parking is not required for any nonresidential use located in the CBD zoning district. At the owner's option, parking may be provided up to but not exceeding the number of spaces allowed by the guidelines for vehicle parking in Table 8-1, Number of Parking Spaces Required, in this section. A larger number requires approval of an alternate parking plan.
4.
During any outdoor event where parts of the off-street parking areas are utilized for such event, the organizer shall ensure that adequate parking still exists for any businesses open during that special event.
D.
Alternate parking plan.
1.
Alternate parking plan; contents. A request for approval of an alternate parking plan is to be submitted to the community development director, and must be supported by the following information:
a.
A parking demand study or other data that establishes the number of spaces required for the specific use. Such a study or data may reflect parking for the same use existing at a similar location or for similar uses at other locations. References to published studies or to the guideline standards of this section are acceptable.
b.
If shared parking is proposed for a mixed-use development, the sum of peak parking demands by use category shall be accommodated for day and night hours on weekdays and weekends. The guidelines for shared parking contained in this section may be used in lieu of a separate study.
c.
If a remote or off-site parking lot is proposed to meet any portion of the parking required, the site and its current zoning classification must be identified, along with the method to transport parking patrons to the use. Written permission from the property owner, including the terms and conditions of the agreement, shall be included with the application. The remote site shall be no further than 500 feet from the use to be served.
d.
If more parking spaces are proposed than would be allowed under the guidelines for vehicle parking of this article, a landscaping plan shall be submitted that illustrates compliance with the parking lot landscaping requirements of the "landscaping, buffers and tree protection" section of this Code.
2.
Alternate parking plan; if approved.
a.
Following approval by the community development director, the requirements of the approved alternate parking plan shall be in writing and recorded by the owner in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in the form of a covenant or deed restriction running with the land for not less than 20 years, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development, and shall be included in any sale, lease, or other transfer of right of occupancy affecting any part of the development.
b.
All tenants of the property or development, whether an owner, lessee, subtenant, purchaser, or other occupant, shall comply with the approved alternate parking plan.
E.
Guidelines for vehicle parking.
1.
Guidelines; vehicle parking by land use. In lieu of establishment under an alternate parking plan, the number of parking spaces to be provided for each type of land use shall be determined by Table 8-1, Number of Parking Spaces Required, rounded to the nearest whole space. Developments containing two or more of the uses listed on the table shall provide the number of spaces required for each use (except as may be reduced under section 8.01 F., shared parking).
2.
Dedication to parking use. Parking spaces provided to meet the minimum requirements of this section, along with the aisles and driveways necessary to provide access to those spaces, shall not be used for any other purpose than the temporary parking of vehicles except as allowed by this UDO. Specifically, no such parking area may be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, or for the sale, display or storage of equipment, goods, materials or supplies.
3.
Not to exceed requirement. In order to prevent excessive lot coverage, an artificial increase in air temperature and an unnecessary increase in surface water run-off, no minimum off-street parking space requirement in Table 8-1, Number of Parking Spaces Required, shall be exceeded by more than 25 percent unless good cause can be shown by the applicant and approved by the community development director.
a.
Single-family, two-family and accessory dwellings are exempt from this provision.
b.
If the minimum number is exceeded, all square footage in excess of the minimum shall be of pervious pavement.
4.
Units of measurement. For the purposes of determining off-street parking requirements, the following units of measurement shall apply:
a.
Gross floor area shall include the total area of all floors, measured between the exterior walls of a building.
b.
In places of public assembly such as stadiums, sports arenas, religious places of worship and other similar places of assembly, in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each 30 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements under this section. In cases where a place of assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed separately for each type and added together.
Table 8-1 Number of Parking Spaces Required
When gross floor area (GFA) is identified, that relates only to an indoor facility.

a.
General. Buffer areas shall contain no driveways, parking areas, patios, stormwater detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall, or earthen berm constructed to provide the visual screening required to meet the standards of this UDO. Utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this UDO will be subsequently achieved. Vehicular access through a buffer may be allowed only as a condition of rezoning, special use or planned development approval by the city council.
b.
Minimum required screening. Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural buffer utilizing existing vegetation or, if existing vegetation is inadequate to provide an opaque screen, a structural buffer, in order to achieve an opaque continuous visual screen to a height of six feet, or any combination of existing and replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen six feet high within two growing seasons.
c.
Natural buffers.
1)
Width. A natural buffer shall have a minimum width of 50 feet, or greater as required to achieve an opaque visual screen.

d)
Fences used in buffers must be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with waterproofing material. All hardware used shall also be of a durable weather resistant material.
e.
Examples of Buffers. The accompanying illustration provides examples of natural and structural buffers. Other solutions meeting the minimum requirements of this section are also acceptable.
f.
Maintenance of buffers. Every buffer and every fence required by this UDO or by special stipulations of zoning shall be maintained by the property owner. Every buffer required by this section shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque continuous visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis.
g.
Buffer modifications. If a structural buffer is provided that creates an opaque screen to a height of no less than eight feet (instead of six), the buffer may be reduced to a width of no less than 15 feet.
h.
Location of buffers. Buffers may be relocated on the site to best achieve the screening required.
H.
Plans, installation and maintenance.
1.
Site landscaping plans; where required.

Tree Conservation.
1.
Tree conservation; where required.
a.
Application to new development or disturbed areas. The requirements of this UDO shall apply to any activity on real property within the City of Douglasville, including, but not limited to, the following:
1)
Single-family and two-family lots. Single-family and two-family lots which are new or expanded.
2)
All new commercial, office, institutional, industrial, and/or manufacturing development and expansion of existing commercial, office, institutional, and/or manufacturing development into undisturbed areas;
3)
All new residential subdivisions and expansion of existing subdivisions (new units and/or phases);
4)
All new mixed-use developments and expansion of existing mixed-use developments into undisturbed areas;
5)
All new multifamily developments and expansion of existing multifamily developments into undisturbed areas; and
6)
All new townhouse developments and expansion of existing townhouse developments into undisturbed areas.
b.
Residential subdivisions.
1)
Residential subdivisions shall identify on the plats/plans the total tree density required by the completion of infrastructure under this section upon completion of infrastructure construction. At a minimum, the subdivider must fully meet the tree density requirements of this section prior to approval of a final plat or commit to such achievement through performance surety for tree planting.
2)
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the tree density requirements have been achieved as identified on the residential site plans.
c.
Nonresidential subdivisions. New commercial and industrial subdivisions are subject to a two-staged review process by the community development director (for the infrastructure and later for each individual lot). For this reason, these subdivisions may base density calculations on the net disturbed site area defined by the limits of clearance and construction. The phase 1 plan shall address the method and timing of ultimate compliance with this section.
d.
Nonresidential out-lots. Out-lots and separate parcels of a phased development must collectively meet minimum requirements for site density; however, in no case may an individual out-lot have less than 14 tree units per acre.
e.
Additions to existing projects. For additions to existing projects, the density requirements may be met in either of the following two ways:
1)
Calculate the area of any new land-disturbance and/or improvements and add replacement trees based on that area (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option); or
2)
Base density requirements on the total site area and count any existing trees on the site, exclusive of zoning buffers and stream buffers.
f.
Phased projects and reduced net site areas. Where development is going to occur in phases (by design or by implication), density calculations must be based on a site area defined by an established or estimated phase line.
Similarly, a reduced net site area may be achieved by using only the area of actual site disturbance (new projects only), provided that a limits of construction line is clearly shown on the plan (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option).
In both instances, the following criteria are applied regarding existing trees:
1)
Existing trees to be counted toward meeting the density requirements should be within the phase line or limits of construction.
2)
If the tree save areas must be established outside these areas, they must be located where future development will not impact them.
The trees in areas outside the phase line or limits of construction may not be counted toward the density requirement of subsequent phases or new projects.
g.
Alternative calculations. Calculations for alternative compliance to tree density requirements shall be made according to the guidelines set forth at section 8.02.J.6., alternative compliance to tree density requirements.
h.
Exemptions from tree conservation requirements. The tree conservation requirements shall not apply to the following:
1)
Horticultural or agricultural. Horticultural or agricultural operations, as follows.
a)
All plant or tree nurseries, Christmas tree farms, and botanical gardens shall be exempt in relation to those trees that are being grown for relocation and continued growth in the ordinary course of business, or for some public purpose.
b)
All orchards of trees in active commercial operation shall be exempt for bona fide agricultural purposes.
c)
Land clearing or clearing and grubbing activities for clearly agricultural purposes. Clearing or grubbing conducted as part of the land development process may be authorized only in accordance with the issuance of a land-disturbance permit under the requirements and provisions of this section. A development permit may not be issued on any property that has been cleared or grubbed as an exempt agricultural activity within the past 12 months, unless approved by the mayor and city council.
d)
Timber harvesting (selective cutting or clear cutting) for pulpwood or sawtimber shall be exempt when conducted as a bona fide agricultural activity. Timber harvesting conducted as part of the land development process may be authorized only in accordance with the issuance of a land-disturbance permit under the requirements and provisions of this section. A development permit may not be issued on any property that has had its timber harvested as an exempt agricultural activity within the past two years.
2)
Removal of disease or infestation. Removal of diseased or infested trees, upon the verification of the community development director or other qualified forestry professional acceptable to the community development director, is exempt.
3)
Imminent hazards to property owners. Removal of trees that have become, or threaten to become, a danger to human life or property, upon the verification of the development services director or other qualified forestry professional acceptable to the director of development services, are exempt.
4)
Roadway construction. Land clearing for designated roadway projects of the Georgia Department of Transportation and the City of Douglasville is exempt.
5)
Exemptions.
a)
The removal of trees from detention ponds and drainage easements is exempt.
b)

i.
Trees to be provided or retained.
1)
Number of tree units upon completion of development.
a)
Minimum standard. On each property for which a tree protection plan is required by this section, existing trees may be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a tree density, standard meeting section 8.02.J.3, minimum standards. The trees, both existing and new, where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees may be retained or planted for credit within a public right-of-way if granted approval by the community development director.
b)
Tree density standard calculation. The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application.
i.
Credit for existing trees to be retained shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table 8-8 for existing trees. Credit shall be given all trees retained on a property having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of three inches or more, except for those trees retained to create a land use buffer required under section 8.02.G.1., land use buffers; where required.
ii.
Credit for new trees proposed on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in the Table 8-9 for new trees. Credit shall be given all new trees on a property, except for new trees of less than one inch in caliper and those trees provided to create a land use buffer required under section 8.02.G.1., land use buffers; where required.
iii.
Additional credits may be granted under the following circumstances:
(a)
A total tree density credit not to exceed twice the units shown on Table 8-8, may be granted by the community development community development director, under the standards set forth in this section, for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as outstanding specimen trees or having historic value or being a rare or unique species.
(b)
Existing trees to be retained within a 100-year floodplain may be granted a bonus of 50 percent of the units assigned in Table 8-8.
2)
Retention of specimen trees. Existing specimen trees (as defined in this UDO) shall not be removed from property other than single-family residential property, unless development would cause irreparable damage to the critical root zones.
j.
Protection of existing trees. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to existing trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property:
1)
Tree protection area. The root system within the dripline is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
a)
The tree protection area shall include, as a minimum, the total area within the dripline plus an additional three feet.
b)
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree protection areas.
c)
All construction activities are prohibited within the tree protection area. Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concreted washout, burn-hole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within the tree protection area.
d)
Once tree protection areas are established and approved, no changes shall be made without first obtaining approval from the community development director of the change, subject to the standards set forth in this section.
2)
Protective barriers.
a)
Protection. Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise completely surrounding the tree protection area. The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or passive. Active protection is required where tree protection areas are located in proximity to construction activity. The locations of all tree protection devices will be verified by the community development director prior to the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. Active tree protection shall consist of chain-link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material.
b)
Signage. All tree protection areas shall be designated as such with "tree protection area" signs. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Such signs shall be a minimum of 16 square feet in sign face area and shall state with minimum three-inch lettering "Attention Subcontractors: You must observe Tree Protection Area—No Construction or Equipment Encroachment. You are responsible for damages" or similar wording. Signs requiring subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards shall be posted visibly at site entrances.
c)
Erosion and sedimentation control. All tree protection areas must be protected from soil erosion and sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area. All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed in a manner that will not result in the accumulation of sediment in a tree protection area.
d)
Inspection. All tree protection devices and erosion control barriers shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing, grading or any land-disturbance activity. The community development director must inspect the installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to the issuance of the development permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development but is to be removed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
3)
Encroachment or Removal. If encroachment into a tree protection area occurs that causes irreparable damage to the trees, the tree conservation plan shall be revised by the permittee to compensate for the loss, and the revised plan must be accepted by the community development director, subject to the standards set forth in this section. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this section, nor shall plan revision activities estop the department from instituting action for violation of this section.
4)
Damage prohibited to specimen trees.
a)
No person shall cut, carve, or otherwise damage or remove any specimen tree on nonresidential property or deface or damage any tree on residential property except in accordance with the provisions of this UDO.
5)
Prohibited activities.
a)
Compaction prohibited. All building materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris, or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or aboveground damage shall be kept outside the tree protection area. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable, the tree protection area shall first be cut cleanly, then immediately mulched with a four-inch layer of processed bark or wood chips or in a six-inch layer of straw.
b)
Grade change prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the tree protection area. Stripping of topsoil in the tree protection area shall not be permitted. Where necessary, the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system. Deposition of sediment in the tree protection area shall be prevented by placement of sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two inch by four-inch wire mesh in areas of steep slope.
c)
Ditches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch within the tree protection area. Where such encroachment is unavoidable, ditches or trenches shall be located as to minimize root damage. Any such excavation in a tree protection area shall require protective measures designed by a certified arborist and approved by the community development director. If roots must be cut, they must be cut cleanly and immediately mulched.
d)
Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious material within the tree protection area.
6)
Purpose of tree protection devices. Tree protection devices required by this section ameliorate the effects of activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to:
a)
Soils compaction in the tree protection area resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials;
b)
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching;
c)
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment;
d)
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, or other activities that will damage the critical root zone.
7)
Other specifications.
Clearing. Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be removed in a manner which does not adversely impact the trees to be preserved. Felling trees into tree protection areas or disturbing roots inside the protection areas is prohibited. Roots shall be cut cleanly before tree removal.
k.
Tree replacement standards. New trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standards on a property shall comply with the following guidelines and standards:
1)
Placement and quality.
a)
The spacing of new trees must be compatible with the spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature.
b)
Species selected for planting must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. When practical, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed. Standards for transplanting shall be in compliance with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual, latest edition or similar publication. Unless otherwise approved by the community development director pursuant to the standards set forth in this section, trees selected for replanting must be on the tree planting list in Table 8-10.
c)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability.

  2)
Deferred planting. In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve the tree density standard are not installed upon application for a certificate of occupancy or a final plat approval, then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 125 percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with the performance bonding requirements and provision of this UDO. Such request for deferred planting shall be in writing and the language must be satisfactory and acceptable to the city attorney prior to permitting deferred planting.
3)
Warranty for new plant materials. Upon final installation of new trees planted under the requirements of this section and following acceptance by the community development director, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for replacement of those which do not survive for a period of no less than two years.
J.
Calculation of tree units.
1.
Use of tree units. Where the requirements of this UDO with regard to the preservation or planting of trees are not expressed in terms of number of trees, they are expressed in terms of "tree units". This approach provides the developer with wide latitude of choice as to the number and sizes of trees to be planted, and their distribution following aesthetic landscaping practices, while achieving a common standard on all properties.
2.
Establishment of tree unit values. The diameter of a tree's trunk establishes the "tree unit" value of an existing tree, as shown on Table 8-11, Tree Unit Values for Existing Trees, or for a newly planted tree as shown on Table 8-12, Tree Unit Values for New Trees. The values assigned to trees of the same size are different for existing and new trees, as indicated in the tables. One "unit" is not the same as one "tree." Actual tree diameters or calipers are to be rounded to the nearest whole number for the calculation of tree unit values (e.g., four and one-half inches in diameter equals five inches).

  3.
Minimum standards. On each property for which a tree conservation plan is required by this UDO, existing trees may be retained and new trees shall be planted so that the property shall attain or exceed the required tree density standard for the proposed use, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area (as required under this section) or a stream buffer. Existing tree retention, as opposed to tree clearing and replanting, is encouraged by this UDO. The minimum required tree density standard shall be as follows:
a.
Residential - 18 tree units per acre.
b.
Office/commercial - 20 tree units per acre.
c.
Industrial - 15 tree units per acre.
4.
Proposed project's tree density calculation. The proposed project's tree density shall be calculated by summing the credits for trees to be retained and trees to be planted and dividing that number by total acreage of the project (excluding zoning buffer and stream buffer acreage). Table 8-13 identifies an example.
Table 8-13 Example Calculation of Tree Units Required
EXPAND
Example: 24.6 acre commercial project with 3.2 acres in zoning buffers and 2.6 acres in stream buffers on the site.
Total Property 24.6 acres
Area in Zoning Buffers -3.2 acres
Area in Stream Buffers -2.6 acres
Net Area Subject to Tree Conservation 18.8 acres
Times Minimum Tree Units Per Acre X 20.0
Total Number of Tree Units in Development 376 Tree Units
  5.
Achieving tree density required. Every reasonable effort must be made to achieve the minimum required tree density standard on each development site. However, this UDO contemplates that, due to topographic or other conditions, the exact number of tree units required by the proposed project's tree density calculation may not be able to be planted and still meet professional standards for spacing and survival. A method of alternative compliance, therefore is provided.
6.
Alternative compliance to tree density requirements.
a.
Overview. The intent of the tree conservation requirements is to ensure that the required density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide a viable alternative for such cases, the developer may be allowed to contribute to the City of Douglasville Tree Replacement Fund. The community development director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance to ensure that physical compliance with established standards cannot be achieved due to site considerations. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. In no instances shall more than 50 percent of the required tree site density be met through alternative compliance.
b.
Number. The number of newly planted trees that can reasonably be expected to survive on a site shall be determined from the following criteria:
1)
Overstory Trees - 200 square feet of pervious root zone.
2)
Understory Trees - 75 square feet of pervious root zone.
c.
Plan. Developers are required to plan their projects in such a manner as to comply with the standards provided by this UDO. Overdevelopment of a lot will not be recognized by the city as a criteria allowing use of the alternative compliance method. Site characteristics permitting use of alternative compliance are limited to those physical features outside the control of the owner and/or developer, such as the presence of rock, unusually steep grades, or ravines.
d.
Land disturbance permit. The land-disturbance permit will only be issued after the community development director has verified entitlement to use the alternative compliance under the standards of this section.
e.
Tree replacement fund. If, in the determination of the community development director, conditions do not allow for the planting of the required tree units on site due to physical characteristics of the lot outside the owner/developer's control, the permit holder may pay the city 125 percent of the total cost of purchase, delivery and installation (including a two-year warranty) of trees at two-inch caliper, and the city will use this money to plant trees on public property for landscape design, planting and maintenance. Actual fees shall be set by the city council from time to time pursuant to the administration and enforcement article of this UDO regarding schedules and fees.
1)
Example: Calculating contribution amounts. How to determine the fee amount if there is a deficit of tree density on a parcel of land:
a)
A 4.0-acre commercial development project site has the following requirements as required in this UDO:
i.
A required tree density factor of 80.0 (20 tree units per acre times four acres).
ii.
Existing trees that will remain total 36.0 tree units.
iii.
There is enough room on the property to accommodate approximately 32.0 tree units.
iv.
Substantiation that sufficient open acreage exists to meet the ordinance standards, but physical features of the site preclude installation of the remaining required tree units.
b)
Determine the tree density deficit as follows:
80.0 tree units are required, minus 36.0 existing tree units on site, minus 32.0 new tree units = a deficit of 12.0 tree units that cannot be physically accommodated on site.
c)
Determine the acceptable contribution as follows:
The calculation for acceptable tree unit deficit contribution is calculated in the following manner:
(Deficit of tree units' x tree unit credit calculation (Table 8-9)) x fee = contribution amount. Example:
i.
There is a deficit of 12.0 tree units
ii.
The minimum diameter tree required is a two-inch tree unit for a tree unit credit of three-tenths per tree (Table 8-13)
iii.
The fee required is the cost of purchase, delivery, installation and two-year warranty of a two-inch caliper (DBH) times 125 percent.
In this example, (12.0 x 0.3) x $FEE = 36 x $FEE = contribution amount.
f.
Fund Administration. The City of Douglasville Tree Replacement Fund will be maintained by the finance director. A report for the City of Douglasville Tree Replacement Fund will be made available to the city council no less often than annually. Use of funds from the tree replacement fund shall be approved by city council.
g.
Specimen trees. The City of Douglasville strongly advocates the preservation of specimen trees. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, the following shall apply:
1)

2)
The tree unit values shown on Table 8-11 may be increased by 100 percent for an existing tree that meets the definition of a "specimen tree" or for a "specimen tree stand" as defined herein, provided that extraordinary measures as needed are taken to protect the tree and assure its survival. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, the provision of tree wells, retaining walls, aeration, or supplementary irrigation, as applicable to the site of the tree and as approved by the community development director according to the provisions of this section.
3)
Removal of specimen trees. Specimen trees may not be removed from property other than single-family residential property for any reason not specifically enumerated as an exemption in section I.1.H. without first obtaining a variance. Such variance must be granted by the city council under the standards set for in section 10.03 of this UDO.
