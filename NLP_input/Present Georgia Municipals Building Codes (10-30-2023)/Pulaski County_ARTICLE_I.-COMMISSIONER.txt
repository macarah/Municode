[Sec. 7.] - Clerk.
Whereas, Ga. Const. art. XV, styled "Home Rule," § II, ¶ 1, designated "Home Rule for Counties," provides that "governing authority of each county shall have legislative power to adopt clearly reasonable ordinances, resolutions or regulations relating to its property, affairs and local government for which no provision has been made by general law and which is not inconsistent with this constitution, or any local law applicable thereto." Further that local laws may be amended or repealed by a procedure set forth in subparagraph (b)1. whereby a repeal resolution may be adopted at two regular consecutive meetings of the county governing authority not less than seven (7) nor more than sixty (60) days apart and a notice containing a synopsis of the proposed amendment or repeal be published in the official county organ and, after this procedure is followed, such local laws which are to be amended or repealed shall then be so amended or repealed; and
Whereas, the 1960 session of the Georgia Legislature passed a certain local act relating to the salary of the Clerk of the County Commissioner of Pulaski County, Georgia, wherein the salary of said clerk was set at three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars per year, said act being amended under the provisions of the "Home Rule for Counties Act" on two subsequent occasions; and
Whereas, the Commissioner of Pulaski County deems it advisable to place the Clerk of said Commissioner of Pulaski County under the direction and control of said Commissioner of Pulaski County so as to direct her duties and responsibilities and to set compensation for said clerk;
Now, by the authority vested in me under the provisions of the laws herein referred to, it is hereby resolved that the act of the 1960 session of the Georgia Legislature relating to the employment and compensation of a clerk for the Commissioner of Pulaski County is hereby repealed. The Commissioner of Pulaski County does repeal in its entirety said act which is contained in the Georgia Laws of 1960, volume Two, pages 301—304 [Sic.]. The Commissioner of Pulaski County shall hereinafter be authorized to employ a clerk on such terms and conditions and shall direct said clerk's duties and responsibilities as to provide for the efficient and competent running of the office of Commissioner of Pulaski County.

Editor's note— Section seven of the original act, which authorized expenditures from the county treasury for clerical work, was repealed by 1922 Ga. Laws, page 413. Thereafter the legislature adopted a succession of acts relating to employment of a clerk without reference to a section number designated in the original act. In that these later acts refer to the same subject matter, the most recent act is included in this compilation as section seven. The section number designation is in brackets to indicate it is not part of the original act. The citation to "Georgia Laws of 1960, Volume Two, pages 301—304" should be to 1960 Ga. Laws, page 3012.
Sec. 8. - Audit of accounts.
Said commissioner shall have all the books of the office audited annually by a certified public accountant, and shall preserve the report of said audit among the files of his office for the inspection of the public, the cost of the same to be paid out of the treasury of said county.
Sec. 9. - Repeal of act of 1914; board abolished.
When the commissioner for said county as herein created shall have been elected and qualified, then the act creating the board of commissioners for the county of Pulaski, approved August 12, 1914, shall be repealed and the existing board of commissioners for said county of Pulaski shall be abolished.
Sec. 10. - Repealer.
All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act be and the same are hereby repealed.
Approved August 18, 1919.
