D.
Defective Materials and Workmanship: Any cracked or broken material, such as pipe, fittings, valves or hydrants shall be removed and replaced with sound pieces, at the expense of the Developer. Joints that leak shall be carefully remade. Remade joints and replaced material shall be retested under the same conditions of operation. If joints or materials are then found to be defective, they shall be remade and replaced until the line passes the required test.
15.64.350 - Surfacing of Trenches in Unpaved Streets and Driveways.
Where pipe lines are constructed on unpaved streets, roads or driveways, the surfacing material shall be stripped and windrowed separately from the general material excavated from trenches. After the line has been installed and the backfill completed within six inches (6") of the original street grade, the salvaged surface shall be replaced. This work shall be considered as general cleanup along with the removal of surplus excavation materials from the street surface and the restoring of the topsoil surfacing outside trench limits to its original condition.
15.64.360 - Rip-Rap.
The Developer shall furnish and place rip-rap as required, and where shown. Rip-rap shall consist of stone or bagged sand-cement to a thickness of approximately twelve inches (12"). Stone shall be hard quarry or field stone of such quality that it will not disintegrate on exposure to water or weathering. Stone shall range in weight from a minimum of 25 pounds to a maximum of 150 pounds with at least 50 percent of the pieces weighing more than 60 pounds. Bagged sand-cement rip-rap shall consist of one part cement and five parts of sand in clean cloth bags, approximately one cubic foot in size. Sand and cement shall be as specified for concrete work herein.
15.64.370 - Replacement Pavement.
A.
Upon completion of backfilling and consolidation of the backfill, the Developer shall furnish all materials and labor and shall replace all pavement removed for construction of the pipelines and appurtenances; and shall also remove and replace, at his own expense, any and all pavements adjacent to pipe trenches which may have been disturbed or damaged as the result of construction operations.
B.
In the event weather conditions do not permit the permanent replacement of pavement immediately subsequent to the completion of pipe line construction, the Developer will be required to maintain temporary surfacing until such time as the weather is suitable for paving operations.
C.
Pavement Replacement: Street pavement shall be replaced in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, 1983 Edition, and with the details shown on the Drawings and/or as specified herein.
1.
Base: On Highways the base for the asphaltic concrete pavement shall be eight inches (8") of concrete, or as shown. On all other streets, driveways, etc., the base for the asphalt concrete or bituminous surface treatment pavement shall be six inches (6") of crushed stone as specified in this section.
2.
Asphaltic Concrete: The crushed stone base shall be thoroughly compacted to the proper level after which it shall be primed and sealed in accordance with the aforesaid standard specification. The wearing course shall consist of 2" of Type "F" plant-mixed asphaltic concrete, conforming to the provisions of "Hot Mix Asphaltic Construction" section 400 of the aforesaid Standard Highway Specifications.
3.
Bituminous Surface Treatment Pavement: The surface of the previously placed crushed stone in sewer trenches and any holes in existing pavement shall be leveled at the proper grade and thoroughly compacted by rolling. The roadway surface shall then be thoroughly cleaned, sealed and primed, after which there shall be applied a double surface bituminous penetration course, one inch (1") in thickness, conforming to the provisions of "Bituminous Surface Treatment", section 424, of the aforesaid Standard Highway Specifications.
D.
Sub-Grade Preparations: Under trench paving the sub- grade shall be thoroughly compacted by approved mechanical compaction equipment to 95 percent as determined by Modified Proctor Test. Compaction tests shall be made at intervals and at locations as directed by the City. These tests shall be conducted by an approved soils testing company and shall be performed by an experienced soils technician. The costs of all tests shall be paid by the Developer.
E.
Pavement Preparation: Before replacement of pavement, the pavement should be cut at least 12" back on each side of the trench or to visible overbreaks, whichever is greater, to a depth of 2" with a concrete saw. No cutback will be required on bituminous surface treatment pavement. This will insure a straight vertical edge for the patch. After making the saw cut, the pavement to be removed should be broken into small pieces and removed. The broken edge below the saw cut is left fairly rough and irregular, but is approximately a vertical plane to provide an aggregate interlock between the patch and the existing pavement. The sub-base material should be carefully placed and shaped. Water should be added to provide a damp but not wet sub-base before the concrete base is placed. The Vertical face of the existing pavement should be sprayed with a fine mist of water to moisten the vertical surface. To further improve the probability of obtaining a bond between the old pavement and the concrete base to be poured, the vertical face of the old pavement should be painted with a solution of Portland Cement and water mixed to the consistency of heavy paint. The new concrete base should then be poured before this surface dries out. The base should be placed with care, making sure it is worked back into all corners and into the rough surface of the existing pavement assuring a locking bond between the old pavement and the new base being placed.
1.
Concrete Base: After the concrete base has cured, the concrete surface and vertical edges of the existing paving must be clean and dry before the tack coat is applied. The tack coat should be applied to the surface of the new concrete base and brushed into the corners and on to the vertical edges of the old pavement to provide a bond and seal out water. The asphalt surface material should be immediately placed after the surface of the tack coat has dried to the point it is sticky to the touch.
2.
Asphalt Surface: The asphalt surface material should be immediately placed after the surface of the bituminous prime has cured. A short period of time is required for the prime to penetrate into the base material.
F.
Replacement of Concrete Curb and Gutter, Street, Driveway and Sidewalk: Concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk shall be replaced with Class "A", 3,00 psi concrete of the same thickness and dimensions as was removed.
15.64.380 - Grassing of Disturbed Areas.
After completion of pipe laying operations, the Developer shall grass disturbed areas.
A.
Grassing Along Highway Right-of-Way: Grassing along highway right-of-way shall be in accordance with Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, 1977 Edition, section 700.
B.
Grassing through Established Pastures: Grassing through established pastures shall be by seeding with the same type of grass as was disturbed or, if acceptable to the City, seeding may be as recommended by the local Soil Conservation Agent.
C.
Grassing of Other Areas: Grassing of other areas shall be by planting grass of a quick growing species that will also give a permanent cover. Seeding may be as recommended by the local Soil Conservation Agent.
D.
Planting: Preparation of soil along highway right-of-way shall be as set out in Highway Specifications. Preparation of Soil in (B) and (C) above shall be performed by the Developer using recognized type equipment and materials for this type operation. Before planting, a fertilizer of 16:4:8 composition, or approved equal, shall be evenly applied at the rate of 20 pounds per 1,000 square feet and discoed or harrowed into the dampened soil. Seeding shall be as stated in (B) and (C) above. Seed, fertilizer, mulch and periodic watering shall be applied in adequate quantities to assure a satisfactory ground cover over the entire disturbed area of construction operations. A satisfactory stand of grass is defined as a full cover, over the seeded area, of live and growing grass with no bare spots larger than two (2) square feet.
15.64.390 - Sterilizing pipe lines.
All pipelines and all appurtenances including house service connections which have been exposed to contamination by reason of this construction shall be sterilized by the developer before being placed in service, subject to the approval and direct supervision of the city.
A.
Sterilization: Pipelines shall remain filled for a twenty-four-hour period with a solution of water and HTH or chlorine in amounts equivalent to at least the following quantities for each one hundred (100) feet of pipe.

  Not less than one (1) ounce of HTH shall be used, per hundred feet, for all mains, sizes two (2) inches and smaller, and the above quantities shall be increased if necessary to secure a chlorine residual of 50 parts per million after twenty-four (24) hours. The city shall obtain a random sample of water taken from the distribution system and perform a colliform analysis before the lines will be accepted. The developer shall furnish all HTH or liquid chlorine required for sterilization, and shall furnish all equipment and labor required for the work.
B.
Flushing: Upon completion of the sterilization, all mains and piping shall be thoroughly flushed before placing in service.
15.64.400 - Cleaning up.
Before the work shall be considered complete, all material not used, and rubbish of every character, must be removed from the streets and all streets, sidewalks, curbs, fences and other private or public facilities and structures disturbed must be essentially in as good condition as existed before the work was done. Any subsequent settlement of backfill or pavement over trenches shall be replaced by the developer and the surfaces brought to grade.
