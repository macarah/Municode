Certificate of appropriateness. For all buildings in a designated historic area or designated historic properties rated exceptional, notable or valuable, the historic preservation commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance will not have a substantial adverse affect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district.

Sec. 58-165. - Additions to existing building.
Additions to an existing building shall comply with the applicable requirements of state and local laws, rules, regulations, codes and standards for new construction. Such additions shall not impose loads either vertical or horizontal which would cause the existing building to be subjected to stresses exceeding those permitted under new construction. If the existing building does not comply with the standards provided in this article and the authorized enforcement authority finds that the addition adversely affects the performance of the total building, the authorized enforcement authority may require:
(1)
The new addition to be separated from the existing structure by at least a two-hour firewall with openings properly protected;
(2)
The installation of an approved automatic fire suppression system; or
(3)
Other remedies which may be deemed appropriate by the enforcement authority.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 6, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-166. - Minor alterations and new mechanical systems.
Minor alterations or repairs to an existing building which do not adversely affect the performance or safety of the building may be made with the same or like materials. Existing buildings which, in part or as a whole, exceed the requirements of any applicable construction or fire safety code may, in the course of compliance with this article, have reduced or removed, in part or totally, features not required by such code for new construction provided such features were not a condition of prior approval. Existing buildings and structures which, in part or as a whole, do not meet the requirements of the applicable code for new construction may be altered or repaired without further compliance to any such code by utilizing the provisions of this article provided their present degree of compliance to any applicable construction of fire safety code is not reduced. Any new mechanical systems installed in an existing building shall conform to applicable codes for new construction to the fullest extent practical as approved by the authorized enforcement authorities.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 7, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-167. - Continued use.
The legal use and occupancy of any building or structure may be continued without change, except as may be provided otherwise by this chapter or as may be legally provided for by any applicable state or local law, rule, regulation, code or standard.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 8, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-168. - Change in use.
(a)
A total change in the use or occupancy of any existing building which would cause a greater hazard to the public shall not be made unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes and standards for the new use or occupancy; however, the compliance alternative provision of this article may be utilized by authorized enforcement authorities where total or strict compliance with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes or standards is not practical.
(b)
When the proposed use is of equal or lesser hazard as determined by the enforcement authority, further compliance with any code for new construction is not required unless otherwise provided in this article. Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect the performance of the building may be made with like materials. Any proposed change to the existing building or change in type of contents of the existing building shall not increase the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures. If the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures is increased, requirements of applicable construction of fire safety codes for exterior walls shall apply.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 9, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-169. - Changes in use of a portion of a building.
(a)
If a portion of a building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is separated from the remainder of the building with vertical or horizontal fire separations complying with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes or standards or with compliance alternatives, the portion changed shall be made to comply with the applicable requirements for the new use or occupancy to the extent noted in section 58-168.
(b)
If a portion of the building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is not separated from the remainder of the building as noted in subsection (a) of this section, the provisions of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes and standards applying to each use or occupancy of the building shall apply to the entire building to the extent noted in section 58-168; however, if there are conflicting provisions in requirements for the various uses or occupancies, the authorized enforcement authority shall apply the strictest requirements.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 10, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-170. - Floor loading.
Any proposed change in the use or occupancy of an existing building or portion which could increase the floor loading should be investigated by a state registered professional architect or engineer to determine the adequacy of the existing floor systems to support the increased loads. If the existing floor system is found to be inadequate, it should be modified to support the increased loads; or the proposed allowable floor loading shall be reduced by and posted by the appropriate enforcement authority.
(Ord. No. 95-30, § 11, 9-21-1995)
Sec. 58-171. - Documentation.
Whenever action is taken on any existing building to repair, make alterations, or change the use or occupancy of an existing structure and when such action proposes the use of compliance alternatives, the authorized enforcement authority shall ensure that at least one copy of the accepted compliance alternative approved, including applicable plans, test data or other data submitted for evaluation, be maintained on file in the office of the chief building official.

Subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall, unless otherwise provided, preempt all laws, regulations or rules governing reconstruction, alteration, repair or maintenance of landmark museum buildings.
(b)
A landmark museum building shall be subject to the following provisions:
(1)
Repairs, maintenance and restoration shall be allowed without the conformity to any building or fire safety related code, standard, rule or regulation, provided the building is brought into and remains in full compliance with this section;
(2)
In case of fire or other casualty to a landmark museum building, it may be rebuilt, in total or in part, using such techniques and materials as are necessary to restore it to the condition prior to the fire or casualty and use as a totally preserved building; or
(3)
If an historic building or structure, as a result of proposed work or changes in use, would become eligible and would be so certified as a landmark museum building, and the state historic preservation officer so certifies and such is submitted to the local fire and building code official with the construction or building permit application, the work may proceed under the provisions of this section.
(c)
All landmark museum buildings shall comply with the following requirements:
(1)
Every landmark museum building shall have portable fire extinguishers as deemed appropriate by the local fire authority having jurisdiction based on the applicable state or local fire safety codes or regulations.
(2)
All landmark museum buildings which contain residential units shall have electrically powered smoke products of combustion detectors installed within each living unit between living and sleeping areas. Such detectors shall be continuously powered by the building's electrical system. When activated, the detector shall initiate an alarm which is audible in the sleeping rooms of that living unit. These unit detectors shall be required in addition to any other protective system that may be installed in the building.
(3)
For all landmark museum buildings, except those protected by a total automatic fire suppression system and one- and two-family dwellings, approved automatic fire warning protection shall be provided as follows: Install at least one listed smoke or products of combustion detector for every 1,200 square feet of floor area per floor or story. In addition, all lobbies, common corridors, hallways and ways of exit access shall be provided with listed smoke or products of combustion detectors not more than 30 feet apart. Detectors shall be so connected as to sound an alarm audible throughout the structure or building. With respect to buildings which are totally protected by an automatic fire suppression system, activation of the sprinkler system shall sound an alarm throughout the structure or building.
(4)
Smoke or products of combustion detectors shall be listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.
(5)
All multistory landmark museum buildings, except one- and two-family dwellings, with occupancy above or below the street or grade level, shall have manual fire alarm pull stations in the natural path of egress.
