ARTICLE XIV. - SIGNS[3]

Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-04 , § I(Exh. A), adopted Aug. 15, 2017, repealed art. XIV in its entirety, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former art. XIV, §§ 14.1—14.19, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2012-06 , § I(Exh. A), adopted March 30, 2012.

14.1 - Findings and Objectives.
14.1-1. Troup County finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. However, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring an increasing number and size of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises.
14.1-2. Troup County finds that the regulation of the size, height, number, location and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the county, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential area, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the county's citizens.
14.1-3. Troup County finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The county commission finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
14.1-4. Troup County finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of location addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
( Ord. No. 2018-04 , § I(Exh. A), 8-15-2017)
14.2 - Intent and Purpose.
14.2-1. The intent of this ordinance is to further the substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this ordinance. It is not the intent of this ordinance to apply regulation to signs based upon the message that they convey.
14.2-2. The purposes of this section are:
1.
To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs;
2.
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
3.
To promote economic development;
4.
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs;
5.
To regulate signs by zoning district, size, height, location on a lot, number, methods of construction, maintenance and illumination;
6.
To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the county and to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment of the county;
7.
To protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
8.
To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this section and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; and
9.
To insure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards.
10.
To further the objectives of the county's comprehensive plan.

14.8 - Changing Signs (Digital Multiple Message).
Changing signs or signs employing changing sign technology shall be allowed exclusively within the G-C, G-I or L-I, zoning district as a portion of a conforming, freestanding sign and are allowed on property used for public or institutional use regardless of zoning district. In no case are changing signs allowed on roads designated as Scenic Corridors in this ordinance, as amended. Changing Signs are further subject to the following requirements:
(1)
Each message displayed on any changing sign display shall remain static for at least thirty (30) seconds following the completion of its transition from the previous message. As used in this subsection "static" shall mean a display that is fixed in one (1) position with no portion of the display being in motion or changing in color or light intensity.
(2)
When a message is changed mechanically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in three (3) seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between any movement of any part of the display of the previous message and the time that the display of the next message is fully static.
(3)
When a message is changed electronically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in two (2) seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between the time that the previous message is static and fully illuminated and the next message is static and fully illuminated.
(4)
No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two fully illuminated static messages displayed in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message.
(5)
No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display.
(6)
No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
(7)
Message transitions achieved by means of the scrolling of the letters, numbers or symbols shall be completed within two (2) seconds and shall remain static for at least sixty (60) seconds following the completion of the transition from the previous message.
(8)
All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change so that the brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The maximum illumination, intensity, or brightness of electronic signs shall not exceed 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours, or 500 nits (candelas per square meter) between dusk to dawn. The sign must have an automatic phased proportional dimmer control, photocell or other light sensing device, or a scheduled dimming timer, or another approved device, which produces a distinct illumination change that reduce nighttime brightness levels (compared to daytime brightness levels). The applicant shall provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has been factory pre-set or can be programmed not to exceed the levels specified in this subsection; end-user manipulation of pre-set levels or to exceed those specifications herein shall not be permitted. Unless another industry standard is accepted, the measurement for purposes of this paragraph shall be at any point ten (10) feet from the surface of the changing sign.
(9)
No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle.
(10)
Any changing sign currently in existence shall comply with the regulations of this part. If a changing sign currently in existence cannot meet these requirements due to the limitation of the technology being employed, the owner of the sign shall be allowed to continue the existing use upon a showing, satisfactory to the director, that the requirements of this part cannot be met.

14.15 - Variances.
(a)
Application. A request for a variance to the provisions of this chapter may be initiated by a property owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the Senior Building Official.
(b)
Application requirements. The application shall be on a form provided by the Department of Building, Zoning and Planning and accompanied by an elevation drawing and/or plot plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed sign. The Senior Building Official may require other information about the variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties.

(c)
Procedure. Upon the filing of any complete application for a variance, a public hearing shall be scheduled and held by the Board of Zoning Appeals (the Board). Public notice of the variance application shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the local jurisdiction at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled public hearing of the Board. Such notice shall state the purpose, location, time and date of the public hearing, and the nature of said application.

Authority. The Board shall have the authority to grant variances to this chapter, upon application by a property owner and after receiving comments by the staff and after holding a public hearing.
(e)
Criteria for action upon variance application. In acting upon variances, the staff shall submit written findings and the Board shall consider the following criteria and the extent to which they support or fail to support the sign variance application:
a.
Where there are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions pertaining to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the owner's or occupant's own actions. Such conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or peculiar shape of the lot.
b.
As a result of such unusual circumstances or conditions, there is an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
c.
The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this ordinance.
d.
The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the sign.
e.
The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning district involved.
(f)
Appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by the decision of the Board shall seek judicial review by filing for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of Troup County within thirty (30) days of the decision.
