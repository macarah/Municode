ARTICLE VII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT PROHIBITION

Sec. 2-4-101. - Findings; public purpose.
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Cobb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrolton, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcoholic beverages are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcoholic beverages are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcoholic beverages and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
(Ord. No. 2004-004A, § 1, 7-13-04)
Sec. 2-4-102. - Prohibited acts.
