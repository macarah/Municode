Such hearing shall be by written request filed with the sheriff within ten days after the date of the notice of the initiation of the action from the wrecker inspector to the operator. Such written request for a hearing shall set forth the reasons why the operator feels that the proposed action should not be taken, and in reasonable detail, the grounds and facts which the operator contends support the operator's position. The sheriff or his designee shall determine whether or not the towing permit shall be temporarily suspended during the period prior to the hearing, and until final action is taken by the sheriff or his designee. Failure of the operator to request a hearing within the specified time shall be deemed to be a waiver by the operator of a right to a hearing, and the sheriff or his designee shall be authorized to proceed with final action on the matter without the holding of a hearing.
(b)
If requested, a hearing shall be held not less than ten days, nor more than 45 days after the date of the filing of the request for a hearing with the sheriff.

If the permit official fails to render a decision within seven calendar days of receipt, any required permit is waived. A notice of denial or revocation shall clearly set forth in writing the grounds upon which the permit was denied or revoked and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application or otherwise procure a permit.
