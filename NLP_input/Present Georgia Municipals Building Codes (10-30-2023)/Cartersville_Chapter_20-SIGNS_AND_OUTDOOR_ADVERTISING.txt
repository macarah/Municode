ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 20-1—20-16. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - SIGN ORDINANCE

Sec. 20-17. - Findings and purposes.
(a)
Purposes. This article was enacted with the following purposes:
(1)
To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs;
(2)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
(3)
To promote economic development;
(4)
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs;
(5)
To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city and to ensure the harmony and compatibility of the character of the area including its physical appearance, natural setting, informal landscaping, and preserve the historic character of the city;
(6)
To encourage and ensure that development that is context-sensitive in design and materials compliments and is compatible and sensitive with the existing character of the area through its proportion, scale, design, style, placement, position, and architectural qualities that further the distinct values of the city;
(7)
To protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
(8)
To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs;
(9)
To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and
(10)
To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit.
(b)
Findings. This article was enacted with the following findings in mind:
(1)
The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises.
(2)
The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens.
(3)
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(4)
The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

Measurement.
(1)
Measurement of sign area.
a.
Size generally. The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest shaped panel, whether rectangular, oval, or otherwise, surrounding the sign text copy and graphic design. The following shall not be calculated when computing sign area: Embellishment, support cladding, monument background and decorative colors.
b.
Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature.
c.
Multifaced signs. For multifaced signs, when the sign face surfaces are back-to-back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is forty-five (45) degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multifaced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one (1) time from any angle.
(2)
Measurement of sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. At the election of the permit holder, the height of a sign may be measured from the highest point on the sign to the level of the nearest road.
(k)
Other laws still apply. All signs shall comply with all federal, state, and city laws, ordinances, codes and rules. Compliance with the terms of this article shall not operate to relieve any individual, corporation or other entity of any other duty imposed by law.
(l)
Property rights of others must be respected. Issuance of a permit hereunder shall not serve to waive any applicable protective covenants or private rights of property ownership.

Sec. 20-32. - Nonconforming signs.
(a)
Signs lawfully existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming "grandfathered" signs and may remain, except as otherwise specifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced or altered in any manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall this provision have the effect of permitting the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair.
(b)
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good repair a nonconforming sign. No repairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep of nonconforming signs shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. A nonconforming sign which has been declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not be repaired, rebuilt or restored unless such repair or restoration will result in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this article.
(c)
A nonconforming sign shall not be moved for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article.
(d)
If a nonconforming sign is removed or discontinued for any period of time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(e)
A nonconforming sign which is changed to or replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article.

In the event that any provision of this article regulates the same activity, conduct or any aspect of signage that is also regulated by city, state or federal law, then the provision most restrictive of signage shall govern.

Sec. 20-47. - Cases, sources and studies considered.
In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and city council recognize the vast number of court decisions, coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following:
• City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction);
• Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed.Appx. 900 (C.A.11 th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests);
• Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community);
• H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction);
• Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11 th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection);
• Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech);
• Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction);
• Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest);
• St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community);
• Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).
Such cases, which were considered by the mayor and city council prior to adoption of this provision, are part of the official record of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter derives.
