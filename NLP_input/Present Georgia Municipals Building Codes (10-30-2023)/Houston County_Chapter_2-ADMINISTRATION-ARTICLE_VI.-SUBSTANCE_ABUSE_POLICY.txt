ARTICLE VI. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY

Sec. 2-336. - Purpose.
(a)
This policy provides guidelines for the detection and deterrence of alcohol and drug abuse. It also outlines the responsibilities of management and employees. It is the policy of the county to maintain a safe, healthful and productive work environment for all employees. To that end the county will act to eliminate any substance abuse (alcohol, illegal drugs or any other substance which could impair an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform the functions of the particular job) which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, substandard performance, poor employee morale or tends to undermine public confidence in the county's workforce. All persons covered by this policy should be aware that violations of the policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination, or in not being hired.
(b)
In recognition of the serious duty entrusted to the employees of the county, with knowledge that drugs and alcohol do hinder a person's ability to perform duties safely and effectively, the following policy against substance abuse is hereby adopted by the county.
(Mo. of 1-16-96)
Sec. 2-337. - Policy.
(a)
No employee of the county may illegally engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of illegal drugs during working or nonworking hours. Such activity, even during nonworking hours, clearly affects an employee's ability to perform his public duties and will be considered grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal from employment.
(b)
The use of alcohol or other intoxicating substances while on duty, or coming to work under the influence of such substances is forbidden. Violation of this rule is cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(c)
Employees using medicine while on the job must do so in strict accordance with medical directions. They may remain on duty only so long as safety, job performance, mood, and behavior are not adversely affected. If the medicine causes problems as mentioned above, then the employee will have to take appropriate leave until the problem clears up. The abuse and/or inappropriate use of medicine is prohibited.
(d)
It is the policy of the county to provide assistance to those regular employees who voluntarily seek help for a drug or alcohol problem or who are referred for help by their supervisors. This help is confidential and will not affect future opportunities for advancement with the county, provided rehabilitation efforts are successful, nor will it affect the employee's present job. Insurance benefits will cover most of the cost of rehabilitation. Drug rehabilitation will not be offered to those employees who fail a drug test upon the request of management. Those who seek help should contact the personnel office for confidential assistance.
(e)
The county reserves the right to search, without employee consent, all areas and property in which the county maintains joint control with the employee or full control. All county vehicles are subject to search by appropriate management personnel. Warrants will be obtained should it become necessary to search areas beyond the county's immediate control.
(f)
Violations of this policy shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge for serious or repeated infractions. Any confirmed indication of drug use shall be grounds for removing an employee from a sensitive position. Refusal to submit immediately to an alcohol and/or drug analysis when requested by management will constitute insubordination which alone will form a basis for discipline.
(Mo. of 1-16-96)
Sec. 2-338. - Employee responsibilities.
An employee must:
(1)
Not report to work or be subject to duty while his/her ability to perform job duties is impaired due to alcohol or drug use, on or off duty.
(2)
Not possess or use, or have the odor of alcohol on his/her breath during working hours, on breaks, during meal periods, while on county property in an official capacity or while operating any county vehicle.
(3)
Not directly or through a third party sell or provide drugs or alcohol to any person or to any other employee while either employee or both employees are on duty, or "on-call";
(4)
Submit immediately to reasonable requests for alcohol and/or drug analysis when requested by a responsible county representative.
(5)
Notify the personnel director in writing of any conviction (including a plea of no contest) of any criminal drug statute within five days after such conviction.
(6)
Provide within 24 hours of request a current valid prescription for any drug or medication identified when a drug screen/analysis is positive. The prescription must be in the employee's name.
(Mo. of 1-16-96)
Sec. 2-339. - Management responsibilities and guidelines.
(a)
Department heads and supervisors are responsible for consistent enforcement of this policy. Any supervisor who knowingly permits a violation of this policy by employees under his/her direct supervision shall be subject to disciplinary action.
(b)
Department heads may request that an employee submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis when a department head has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Reasonable suspicion" is a belief based on objective and articulate facts sufficient to lead a reasonable prudent supervisor to suspect that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol so that the employee's ability to perform his/her job safely is reduced. For example, any of the following, alone or in combination may constitute reasonable suspicion:
(1)
Slurred abnormal speech;
(2)
Alcohol on breath;
(3)
Inability to walk a straight line;
(4)
Physical altercation;
(5)
An uncharacteristic verbal altercation;
(6)
Behavior which is so unusual that it warrants summoning a supervisor or anyone else with authority;
(7)
Possession of alcohol or drugs;
(8)
Information obtained from a reliable person with personal knowledge.
(c)
Any department head requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis should immediately notify a second supervisor to observe the employee's behavior. Should the second supervisor concur that the employee appears to be in violation of the policy, the following procedure shall immediately be applied:
(1)
The department head should document in writing the facts constituting reasonable suspicion that the employee in question is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.
(2)
Any department head requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis shall be responsible for the employee's transport to the county's designated facility where a drug and/or alcohol test will be requested. Drug testing will be performed at the Houston Drug Action Council (HODAC), from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. After hours testing will be performed in the laboratory facilities at the Houston Medical Center at 1601 Watson Boulevard.
(3)
Any department head encountering an employee who refuses to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis upon request shall remind the employee of the requirements and consequences of this policy. Any employee refusing to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test shall not be forced to submit to such testing. The department head should ask the employee to wait a reasonable time until an authorized county representative can transport the employee home.
(4)
Department heads and supervisors shall not physically search employees.
(5)
Department heads and supervisors shall notify the county sheriff's department when they have reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee may have illegal drugs in his or her possession or in an area not jointly or fully controlled by the county.
(Mo. of 1-16-96)
Sec. 2-340. - Results of drug and/or alcohol analysis.
(a)
Upon a negative result, the employee shall return to work and job performance will continue to be monitored.
(b)
If the test result in positive, a second screen using a different testing technique will be given on the same sample. If the second screen shows a negative result, it will be assumed that the individual is not under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. If the second screen shows a positive result, the employee will be presumed to be impaired by alcohol or controlled substances.
(c)
The discipline for being under the influence of alcohol or nonprescribed controlled substances will be based on the employee's work history, previous disciplinary actions and previous identification of substance abuse problems.
(Mo. of 1-16-96)
Sec. 2-341. - Physical examinations.
(a)
Physical examinations may be required of applicants selected for public safety positions with Houston County. As part of the physical examination, a urine drug screening will be given. Additionally, all applicants for full time positions will be required to pass a drug test prior to reporting for work. The drug analysis test for any substance which could impair an employee's ability to effectively and safely perform the functions of his/her job, including, but not limited to, the following substances:
(1)
Amphetamine/methamphetamine (e.g. speed, crystal);
(2)
Benzodiazepines (e.g. valium, librium, oxazepam, serax, dalmane, ativan);
(3)
Barbiturates (e.g. amobarbital, butabarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, secobarbital);
(4)
Cocaine;
(5)
Methaqualone (e.g. quaalude);
(6)
Opiates (e.g. codeine, heroin, morphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone);
(7)
Phencyclidine (PCP);
(8)
THC (marijuana);
(9)
Alcohol.
These drug groups were selected based upon known abuse in the community and the ability of each drug to adversely affect physical/mental performance. All are controlled substances under state and federal law.
(b)
The amount of each chemical substance that is required to show as "positive" varies from drug to drug. The specific amount is a standard selected by the testing laboratory based upon the purpose of the testing program. In our situation, the laboratory will use standards that will ensure a drug is genuinely present when a positive result occurs. The length of time that drugs remain in the system varies tremendously from drug to drug. The length of time a drug remains in the system also varies from person to person. While these variables exist, none of them will cause drugs to test positive beyond what we consider recent usage.
(c)
When an individual is directed by the county to the physician for drug screening, the following procedure shall be observed:
(1)
The drug screening procedure is explained to the individual, a medical interview is done and any questions are answered by the physician or designated representative.
(2)
The individual is asked to sign a waiver giving permission to perform the drug screening.
(3)
The physician presents the individual with a special empty sterile container and the sanitary seal on the container is broken in front of the individual.
(4)
The individual is accompanied to a restroom to give the sample in order to prevent tampering with the sample.
(5)
The individual's social security number is placed on the container and it is placed in a special envelope. The individual then initials the container and envelope.
(6)
The drug screening tests are conducted on part of the sample and if it tests positive, a second test using a different methodology is conducted to confirm the positive result.
(7)
If the tests result in one positive and one negative result the overall test is considered negative.
(8)
The results of the test are forwarded to the physicians office in a written report. That report is then forwarded to the county.
(9)
The positive test samples are retained frozen so employee's appealing under the county's grievance procedure have the opportunity to have their sample retested if so required.

(Mo. of 1-16-96)
