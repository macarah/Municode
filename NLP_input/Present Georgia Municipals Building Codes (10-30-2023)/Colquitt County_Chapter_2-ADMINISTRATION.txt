Accordingly, the county may terminate, at no charge to the county, any purchase order or contract if it is found that substantial gifts or gratuities were offered to a county employee. The county may also take disciplinary action, including dismissal, against a county employee who solicits or accepts gifts or gratuities of any value whatsoever.

(a)
The county encourages the use of local suppliers of goods, services and construction products whenever possible. The county also vigorously supports the advantages of an open competitive market place.

(b)
When the quotation or informal bids selection method is used by the purchasing agent or using agency head to seek firms to quote on the county commodities, services and construction products, local firms should be contacted, if possible, first. Where the purchasing agent or using agency head ascertains that there may not be at least three qualified informal bidders, quotes may be sought from outside the county market.
(c)
In the event of a tie bid, when all other factors are equal, the purchasing agent shall select the bid from within the county, except that the purchasing agent and the county shall retain the flexibility to make the award of contract to a bidder outside of the county if there is sufficient evidence to support collusive bidding in favor of a local source.
(d)
The local vendor preference policy shall only be applied when the lowest local qualified bidder is within seven percent or $25,000.00, whichever is less, of the lowest non-local bidders. The lowest local qualified bidder will be allowed to match the bid of the lowest non-local bidder and, if matched, the lowest local qualified bidder will be awarded the contract.

If known, one or more suppliers should be recommended. If the requisitioner feels a particular supplier should not be used, it should be so stated along with the PR with a brief explanation.
(9)
The quantity requested should clearly identify measurable units such as pieces, sheets, pounds, gallons, feet, etc.
(10)
Descriptions should be complete and detailed. Specifications should be written so that no guess work is required. If a specification such as color is not important, it should be so stated on the PR. If known, the manufacturer and part number should be shown.

(12)
The requisitioner should include on, or attached to, the PR, any useful information whatsoever that will assist in making the best possible buy on the needed supplies or services.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(1))
Sec. 2-178. - Vendor selection.
Vendors will be selected on a competitive basis. Bids, quotations, and proposals will be solicited by newspaper advertising, direct mail, requests of prospective suppliers and by telephone, email, fax, website notice or other commonly utilized electronic media, as appropriate. Purchase orders or contracts will be awarded to the lowest and best responsible vendor. All bids may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so. In determining "lowest and best responsive and responsible vendor," in addition to price, the following will be considered:
(1)
The ability, capacity, and skill of the vendor to perform the contract or provide the material or service required.
(2)
Whether the vendor can perform the contract or provide the material or service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference.
(3)
The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the vendor.
(4)
The quality of performance of previous contracts, orders, or services.
(5)
The previous and existing compliance by the vendor with laws and ordinances relating to the contract, order or service.
(6)
The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the vendor to perform the contract, fill the order, or provide the service.
(7)
The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplier, or contractual services to the particular use required.
(8)
The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract.
(9)
The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(2); Res. No. 2016-R-10, 12-6-16)
Sec. 2-179. - Requests for proposals and request for quotations.
(a)
A request for proposal (RFP) is a formal solicitation that seeks to leverage the creativity and knowledge of business organizations to solve a unique problem or need. The RFP method does not use the cost of the project as the single determining factor, but, rather, uses a combination of cost plus best proposed solution to determine the award of the contract. The RFP will include a general description of the items to be purchased; the bid deposit and performance bond required, if any; where bid blanks and specifications may be secured; and, the time and place for opening bids. A request for quote (RFQ) includes well defined specifications and/or scope of work, and contains all contractual terms and conditions. The RFQ method solicits price quotations from prospective vendors and uses the lowest responsive and responsible bidder as a basis for award of a contract. Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in the RFP or RFQ. A tabulation of bids can be obtained from the purchasing office after the opening.
(b)
Purchases of less than $500.00 will be made in the open market without necessary resort to RFPs or RFQs, and may be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by department heads and authorized by department heads.
(c)
Purchases of $501.00 to $1,000.00 must have three bids, either written or verbal, which must be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by the purchasing agent. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent cannot secure at least three bids within a time frame of five working days, then two or less bids shall be considered adequate.
(d)
Purchases of $1,001.00 to $20,000.00 require three written bids which must be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by the purchasing agent. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent does not receive at least three written bids within a time frame of five working days, then two or less shall be adequate.
(e)
Purchases over $5,000.00 must be approved by the board of commissioners.
(f)
Whenever any goods or services, other than automobiles, are available to the county through a contract with the federal or state government, and when such items or services meet the requirements of a using agency, such item or service shall be deemed to have met all the requirements of competitive bidding and may be purchased under the federal or state contract without regard to further government requirements. The purchasing agent shall be authorized to award contracts for the acquisition of goods and services from a state or federal contract when the cost associated with the good or service is within the prescribed budget authorized by the commission. No additional commission approval shall be required. All such contracts shall be reported to the commission on a monthly basis.
(g)
Purchases over $20,000.00 require RFPs or RFQs solicited by the purchasing agent, and are subject to the following requirements:
(1)
The RFP or RFQ must be publicly advertised in accordance with either or both of the following notice provisions. Contract opportunities that are advertised solely on the internet shall be posted continuously for at least four weeks prior to the opening of sealed bids or proposals.

i.
A statement that all bids must be in writing and delivered to the purchasing agent in a sealed envelope.
(3)
All bids shall be open publicly in the office of the county administrator, without discussion with any bidders; all such bids shall be publicly tallied; and shall be preserved pursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act.
(4)
All such purchases generally require at least three written bids. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent does not receive at least three written bids, then two or less shall be adequate.
(h)
The purchasing agent shall be authorized to enter into cooperative purchasing agreements with other units of government pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-69A-2, when, in his or her judgement, it would be in the best interest of the county.
(i)
Construction contracts which may involve expenditures greater than $100,000.00, other than road construction contracts as defined by O.C.G.A. § 32-4-60, shall follow all requirements as outlined in the Public Works Construction Law, O.C.G.A. Chapter 91 of Title 36.
(j)

(Res. No. 2016-R-10, 12-6-16; Ord. No. 2018-1, 3-6-18; Ord. No. 2022-ORD-1, 3-1-22)
Editor's note— Res. No. 2016-R-10, adopted Dec. 6, 2016, repealed the former § 2-179 and enacted a new § 2-179 as set out herein. The former § 2-179 pertained to invitation for bids and request for quotations and derived from a motion of June 6, 1995, § IV(3); Ord. No. 96-8, adopted Oct. 1, 1996; and Ord. No. 99-1, adopted Mar. 15, 1999.
Sec. 2-180. - Negotiation.
The IFB method of formal advertising and to lesser extent the RFQ method, involves the inflexible process of sealed bids, public opening, and award to the lowest and best responsible bidder. Negotiation, on the other hand, usually involves, after receipt of quotations, the process of bargaining with suppliers or offerers proffering the best deal to the county. Notwithstanding county procurement by negotiation, like procurement by formal advertising requires the observation of impartiality toward all offerers. While negotiation procedures are more flexible than advertised procedures, such flexibility demands a greater degree of care to ensure that all competitive offerers are treated equally. Negotiation, as a purchasing technique, shall be used only after authorization by the board of county commissioners.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(4))
Sec. 2-181. - Purchase orders.
(a)
This procedure will deal with formal purchase orders (POs). The purchase order is basically a legal contract. It represents a meeting of the minds between buyer and seller. All formal purchase orders will be prepared by the director of purchasing and executed and issued by the purchasing agent. No purchase order will be issued without a properly processed purchase requisition.
(b)
All purchases, except purchases of less than $50.00 whether for single or multiple items, will require a purchase order.
(c)
The purchase order will be a numbered, three-part form. After the purchase order is executed, it will be issued as follows:
(1)
White copy. Mailed to the vendor.
(2)
Yellow copy. Maintained in the purchasing department.
(3)
Pink copy. Accounting department.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(5))
Sec. 2-182. - Purchase order log.
The director of purchasing will maintain a PO log that will show the following information:
(1)
PO number.
(2)
Date the PO was issued.
(3)
Department.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(6))
Sec. 2-183. - Charge account purchases.
(a)
The purchasing agent will issue purchase orders to selected vendors establishing charge accounts. This method of buying is intended to expedite the procurement of frequently needed low dollar value supplies. Blanket purchase orders will have a $250.00 cumulative limit and no single purchase may be over $50.00. Department heads will forward to the purchasing agent a list containing the names and signatures of all personnel proposed to be authorized to sign for supplies under these agreements. Any changes to the name/signature list should be made in writing and filed with the purchasing agent.
(b)
When charging supplies, the vendor's invoice must be signed by the authorized county employee receiving the material. Department heads will forward these signed invoices immediately to the director of purchasing. The director of purchasing must have all signed invoices in order to verify the accuracy of the vendor's monthly bills. Invoices signed by unauthorized personnel will not be paid.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(7))
Sec. 2-184. - Emergency purchases.
Emergency purchases may be approved by the county administrator upon the request of the appropriate department head and recommendation of the purchasing agent.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(8))
Sec. 2-185. - Receipt and inspection.
The ordering agency shall ultimately be responsible for the receipt, inspection, and acceptance of the incoming supplies and equipment. Receiving procedures are as follows:
(1)
When any or all items on the PO have been received, inspected, and accepted, the delivery receipt shall be signed and forwarded to the director of purchasing.
(2)
When received items are not acceptable, the receiving agency shall forward to the purchasing agent a receiving report with the reason for rejection stated thereon. The purchasing agent will then arrange for the return and replacement of the defective items, or take other action as required. In the case of defective supplies, the receiving report will also be used as a rejection report.
(3)
When items that already have been accepted are subsequently found to be defective, the using agency shall notify the purchasing agent in writing. The following information, when known, is required:
a.
Name of supplier.
b.
PO number item was purchased on.
c.
Date defective item was received.
d.
Nature of defect.
e.
Action requested (return for credit, for replacement, etc.).
(4)
When items are to be received by or delivered to someone or someplace other than the using agency, the above procedures shall be modified only to the extent that:
a.
Someone other than a using agency employee may sign the delivery receipt, but must notify the using agency of receipt of the order.
b.
Someone should satisfy himself regarding the condition of the items, and check the items delivered against the machine copy of the purchase order.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(9))
Sec. 2-186. - Payments.
Most vendors offer a cash discount if their invoices are paid promptly. To take advantage of this discount policy and maintain good vendor relations, it is important that all invoices, packing slips, and receiving reports be forwarded to the director of purchasing without delay. These documents should reach the director of purchasing within one working day after their receipt by using agencies.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(9))
Sec. 2-187. - Change orders.
(a)
Using agencies wishing to change or cancel an existing purchase requisition or purchase order shall issue a purchase requisition requesting such change or cancellation. The changed PR will require the same signatures as required on the original PR. Always refer to the original PR number and clearly state the action requested.
(b)
Upon receipt of a properly signed and processed change request PR, the purchasing agent will issue a change order or change the original PR, as required. When a change or cancellation is decided upon, the purchasing agent should be notified immediately. A few hours advance notice to the purchasing agent could save the county costly restocking or cancellation charges.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(10))
Sec. 2-188. - Vendors catalog file.
The purchasing agent will maintain a vendor's catalog file. Catalogs in this file will be available to all interested county employees.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(11))
Sec. 2-189. - Sale of personal property.
Only property declared surplus and obsolete to the needs of the county will be offered for sale. Only the purchasing agent is authorized to sell all supplies which have become unsuitable for public use, or to exchange the same for, or trade in the same on new supplies. Surplus supplies will be sold on a competitive basis to the highest bidder.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(12))
Sec. 2-190. - Maintenance contracts.
The purchasing agent will maintain all records and information concerning county maintenance agreements. Before renewing any such agreement, the purchasing agent will check with the concerned department head to determine if the agreement should be renewed. Agreements found to be unnecessary will be terminated. Department heads will advise the purchasing agent of any change in the status of items covered by maintenance agreements. A copy of maintenance contracts will be on file also in the county clerk's office.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(13))
Sec. 2-191. - Service center.
An inventory of gasoline, oil, and other supplies will be maintained at the purchasing department's service center. Parts, gasoline, and oil issued to the various departments will be charged to the departments at the end of each month.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(14))
Sec. 2-192. - Storeroom.
(a)
The purchasing agent will establish and control a central storeroom for selected items such as office supplies, janitorial supplies, etc. This system will enable the purchasing agent to buy storeroom items in large quantities at a considerable cost savings as compared to buying such items as required. The storeroom method will also allow the county to standardize frequently used supplies.
(b)
When a using agency needs any item that falls in the storeroom category, it will prepare a purchase requisition and present it to the purchasing agent for filling. If the requested item is not in stock, the purchasing agent will buy it, using the purchase requisition as authority to purchase. Requisitioned storeroom items will be charged to the appropriate departments at the end of each month.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(15))
Sec. 2-193. - Suggestions.
Suggestions that will help reduce cost, promote efficiency, or improve supplier services are both welcome and requested. Cost reduction ideas should reduce cost without a corresponding reduction in quality of service.
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(16))
Sec. 2-194. - Sole source purchase.
(a)
Based upon evidence that a particular commodity or service may be obtained from only one source and no similar commodity or service available from a different source will adequately meet an acquiring office's requirements and specifications, the purchasing director may decide that the commodity or service be purchased sole source or by brand name based upon supporting documentation from the requesting department.
(b)
A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurement(s) or by approval of the county manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source.
(c)
Any such purchase shall be documented as to the reasons for the sole source and shall be maintained in the office of the purchasing director. Any department wishing to make a sole source purchase must furnish the purchasing director who will then refer it to the county manager with a written request which fully explains why it is essential to do so. Any proposed sole source purchase that is more than $5,000.00 in value must be approved by the board of commissioners. The county manager shall make the decision if the purchase is $5,000.00 or less, or schedule it for action by the board of commissioners if greater than $5,000.00.

ARTICLE VI. - RECORDS MANAGEMENT[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2003-1, § 4, adopted Jan. 7, 2003, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence, its inclusion herein as article VI, sections 2-201—2-215, was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-201. - Policy.
The county board of commissioners recognizes that its citizens have a right to expect, and the county has an obligation to maintain, an efficient and cost-effective records management program and it further recognizes the importance of county records in the lives of its citizens. The county has a responsibility to its citizens to manage, protect, preserve and make available county records.
It is the policy of the county board of commissioners to provide for efficient, economical, and effective controls over the creation, distribution, organization, maintenance, use, retention, and disposition of all records of the county. This policy will be implemented through a comprehensive system of integrated procedures for the management of records from their creation to their ultimate disposition, consistent with the requirements of the Georgia Open Records Act and accepted records management practice.
The decision to adopt the county's records management program is a commitment to improving the county's overall record keeping system. The county acknowledges that, while the utilization of retention schedules and micro-graphics may in fact delay the inevitable chaos that results from records mismanagement or non-management, long-term benefits can be realized only through the introduction of a well-conceived, preplanned, comprehensive program that emphasizes the design, creation, use, maintenance and disposition of records.

Except when a county record is transferred into the archival custody of records center, legal custody of a county record created or received by a department during the course of business remains with the director. The legal custodian, as guardian of the record, does not relinquish responsibility for the care, preservation, or legal disposition of the record even though physical custody of the record for maintenance and preservation purposes may be held by another department or agency. The physical custodian of the record is also responsible for complying with all records management program requirements, policies, and procedures. An original county record may not leave the custody of the department concerned when it is being used by a member of the public.
Every official or employee shall deliver to any successor of county records pertaining to the office held by the county officer or employee. The legal and physical custody of a county record that has continuing historical value to the county may be transferred to records center upon agreement between the director and the records management coordinator. Records center's custody of the record subsequently will be known as archival custody, and ownership of the record remains with the county. The records center shall have legal and physical custody of all county records belonging to any defunct department that does not have a named successor.
