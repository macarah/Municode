(1)
Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within city supervision:
a.
The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof.
b.
Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe, and bolted mechanical joints may be required by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent.
c.
The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four inch pipe shall not be less than ⅛ inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed.
d.
The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines.
e.
Any excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent.

Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564.
h.
Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
i.
PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wasted (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superintendent.
j.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45 degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least 0.1 foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.
k.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
l.
No person shall make connection of roof down spouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved by the superintendent for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.
m.
The location of any sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
n.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the superintendent before installation.
o.
If any house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city may:
1.
Require the owner to repair the house sewer.
2.
Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property.
3.
Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system.

Each resident of the city who is the head of the household of the residential dwelling unit in which such person resides and upon whom is imposed a residential water or sewer service charge for the residential dwelling unit in which such person resides by the provision of this article, and who is 65 years of age or older, or who is then totally disabled according to a current ruling of any agency of this state or the federal government, and who has a gross annual income from all sources, including the income of all members of such person's family residing within the residential dwelling unit, not in excess of the income level designated, from time to time, by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as the income level which qualifies a two-member family in the county for the very low income bracket, or $12,000.00, whichever is greater, shall be required to pay a base monthly minimum charge of $5.50, for water services and $5.50 for sewer services. Such person shall also be required to pay $5.90 per 1,000 gallons of water usage and $4.61 per 1,000 gallons of water as measured through the water meter at each such residence for sewer usage. The minimum monthly bill for such persons qualifying under this section shall be $11.00 for any month that usage does not measure on the meter or measures less than 1,000 gallons of water usage.
(b)
The credit provided in this section shall not, however, be granted unless an affidavit of the person claiming the credit, prepared upon forms prescribed and provided by the city clerk for that purpose, shall be filed with the city clerk, which affidavit shall be filed annually on or before January 15, except that such affidavit may be filed at any time during 1986, and the exemption from such payment shall apply to each billing cycle beginning more than 30 days thereafter, and shall show the age of the person claiming such exemption on the date of the filing of such affidavit or shall have attached a true copy of a determination of total disability issued by either a state or federal agency if disability is claimed as the ground for exemption, the total amount of income received by such person from all sources during the immediately preceding calendar year, the total amount of income received during the immediately preceding calendar year from all sources by each other family member residing in such residential dwelling unit, together with a statement that such claimant's income, when added to the income of each other family member residing in the residential dwelling unit will not be in excess of the income level designated, for that calendar year, by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as the income level which qualifies a two-member family in the county for the very low income bracket, or $9,000.00, whichever is greater, in the calendar year in which such affidavit is filed, together with the exact address of the residence of such claimant, and including such other information as may be required by the city clerk.
(c)
It shall be unlawful to willfully furnish any false information to the city clerk to obtain the exemption from a portion of the monthly water and sewer service charge as provided for in this section.
(d)
If any person has once qualified under this section for a reduced water and sewer service charge and, subsequent thereto, such person becomes disqualified therefor, it shall be the duty of such person to immediately so notify the city clerk who shall remove such person's name from the list of those receiving the exemption. If any such person fails to so notify the city clerk and continues to receive such exemption after being no longer qualified therefor, such person shall be immediately liable to the city for the difference between the amount actually paid for such service by such person and the amount that would have been required to be paid by such person without such exemption. Upon the refusal of such person to pay the difference, the city clerk shall cause all city utility services to be discontinued as to such person's residence until such time as such person has paid the difference in full.
