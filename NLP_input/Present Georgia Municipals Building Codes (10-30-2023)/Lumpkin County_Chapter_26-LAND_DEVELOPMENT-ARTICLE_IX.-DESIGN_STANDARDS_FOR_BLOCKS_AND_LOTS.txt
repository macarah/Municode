ARTICLE IX. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS AND LOTS

Sec. 26-248. - Residential block lengths and widths.
Block lengths and widths shall be as follows:
(1)
Blocks shall not be greater than 1,800 feet nor less than 600 feet in length, except as necessitated by topographical, natural features or other unusual cases.
(2)
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots, except where fronting on major thoroughfares, access highways, or prevented by topographical conditions or size of property; in which case the planning commission may approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 800, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-249. - Lots sizes and proportions (residential subdivisions).
(a)
Residential lots shall meet the lot area requirements of one-acre minimum for individual lots not within a subdivision unless provided for elsewhere in this chapter. (See classes of subdivisions.)
(b)
Residential lots in class I, II, and III subdivisions shall have a depth of not less than 100 feet unless the planning commission determines that circumstances make these limitations impracticable.
(c)
Residential lots in class I, II, and III subdivisions shall have a width of not less than 100 feet unless the planning commission determines that circumstances make these limitations impracticable or a lesser minimum width is specified elsewhere in this chapter.
(d)
Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from all abutting streets.
(e)
A single residential lot or tract of land may have a maximum of two dwellings (houses) except that lots in a class II, III, and IV and V subdivisions are limited to one dwelling per lot. A garage apartment in a building separate from the house with all appurtenances for living is considered a separate dwelling unit. Any variances to this rule must be approved by the planning commission.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 801, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-250. - Adequate building sites.
Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setbacks lines required by these regulations and any other state of county regulations.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 802, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-251. - Lot line arrangements.
In so far as practical side lot lines shall be at right angle to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for at least 30 feet on or have access to a dedicated public street or road, except as provided elsewhere within this chapter.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 803, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-252. - Panhandle or flag lots.
Panhandle or flag lots may be allowed within certain classes of subdivisions where the terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. (See classes of subdivisions.) Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 30 feet wide, and the panhandle access not be more than 250 feet long, at which point the property lines must diverge at an angle not less than 25 degrees unless specified differently elsewhere in this chapter.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 804, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-253. - Building setback lines.
(a)
All building setbacks are measured from any portion of the structure to the property line and/or the nearest edge of the right-of-way. Fences and retaining walls are not required to meet setbacks.
(b)
The minimum building setbacks shall be as follows:
(1)
Within a new or existing subdivision that received approval through the planning commission the front setback shall be 30 feet from any right-of-way and/or the front property line, all other setbacks shall be 20 feet unless different setbacks are specified elsewhere in these regulations or this chapter.
(2)
Any lot within a class I or class II subdivision or on an individual lot, not a part of a subdivision, the front setback shall be a minimum of 50 feet, all other setbacks shall be 20 feet.
(3)
All lots adjacent to a state route must have a minimum of a 50-foot setback from the right-of-way.
(4)
Corner lots and lots with road frontage on more than one street shall meet the front yard setback for that lot from the structure to every right-of-way.
(5)
There is a minimum ten-foot setback from all recorded easements except ingress/egress easements. Ingress/egress easements shall be treated as right-of-way for the purpose of setback requirements. Setbacks from ingress/egress easements may be reduced to less then 50 feet by the planning director with just reason.
(6)
Electric transmission lines where easements are not definitely established shall have a minimum building setback of no less than 60 feet for lines of 69 kV or less and 80 feet for lines of 70 kV or more measured from the nearest wire or pole or ten feet from the easement line where an easement is established.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 805, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-254. - Double frontage lots.
Double frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 806, 7-16-2009)
