Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission.
(2)
Failure of the commission to act within said forty-five (45) days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.

The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such case, no building permit shall be issued.
(k)
Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done.

(p)
Appeals.
