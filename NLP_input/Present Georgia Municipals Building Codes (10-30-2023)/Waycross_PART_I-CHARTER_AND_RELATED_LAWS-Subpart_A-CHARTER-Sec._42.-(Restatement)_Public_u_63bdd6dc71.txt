Be it further enacted, that said city commission of said City of Waycross shall have the right and authority to construct, own, use and operate for municipal purposes and for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of said city, and for profit, a system of waterworks, a system of electric lights, a system of gasworks, a system of street railway, a telephone system and exchange, and other public utilities—any one, more, or all as, and whenever it may consider it expedient; to make rules and regulations regarding the use of same, and fixing prices and rates; and to provide by ordinance for the punishment of those who illegally use water, electricity or gas, or service from such public works, or who illegally divert such gas, water or electricity from their proper channels of transmission. When consumers of such water, electricity, or gas, so furnished by the city, shall fail to pay for same promptly, when due, said city commission is hereby authorized to cause executions to be issued in favor of said city against delinquent consumers for the amount of such unpaid bills, which shall be enforced and levied as in cases of other executions running in favor of the city, and also to cut off the supply until the bills are paid—either method, or both, at its option; and in the event such supply is cut off, it may provide for the payment of a reasonable fee for turning same on again.
