ARTICLE XI. - ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 22-431. - Purpose and intent.
The mayor and council find that businesses are seeking licenses for designations as party rental, teen clubs, dance clubs, etc. These businesses purport to not sell a product, but rather provide a venue for entertainment either through directly charging patrons for entry or renting their facility to third parties who then charge patrons for entry. Typically, these businesses provide live or pre-recorded music or similar entertainment and generally open when alcohol serving establishments close. As a result, patrons flow to these establishments and continue partying well into the night. A large number of the patrons may have been consuming alcohol and it is impossible to detect every intoxicated driver, a public safety concern arises. Additionally, because of the large crowds at these establishments, public safety have experienced increased calls for service to include fights, intoxicated persons, illegal drug use and possession, gang related activities, firearms related issues, all of which create a burden to public safety, leaving other areas of the city without proper coverage while forcing increased focus on these establishments.
