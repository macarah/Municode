DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 46-26. - Statutory authorization of article.
The legislature of the state has in O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 46-27. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 46-28. - Statement of purpose of article.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 46-29. - Objectives of article.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b.
If subsection (5)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 46-66(2), and the elevation standards of subsection (1) and the encroachment standards of subsection (5)a. are met.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 5, § B; Ord. of 5-3-16(1))
Sec. 46-68. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-32, where small streams exist but where no base flood data have been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 46-53(9).
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 5, § C)
Sec. 46-69. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
Standards for subdivision proposals are as follows:
(1)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(2)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(3)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(4)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 5, § D)
Sec. 46-70. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-32, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. Therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:
a.
Have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
b.
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. of 10-25-90, art. 5, § E; Ord. of 5-3-16(1))
