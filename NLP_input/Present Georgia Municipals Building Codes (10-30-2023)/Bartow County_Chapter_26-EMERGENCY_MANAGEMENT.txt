The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a 20 percent or greater increase in the price at which the goods, materials, services, or housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in costs which accurately reflects an increase in cost of the goods or services to the person, firm or corporation selling the goods or services or an increase in the cost of transporting the goods or services into the area.
State of emergency. The term "state of emergency" is defined, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(7), as a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster or emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering threatened or caused thereby.

In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the county commissioner may declare a local emergency for Bartow County. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in section 26-31 of the Code.
(b)
Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the commissioner may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster.
(c)
Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the commissioner finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the commissioner shall execute and file with the clerk of the commissioner a document marking the end of the state of emergency.

No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.
(b)
Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the commissioner is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control.
