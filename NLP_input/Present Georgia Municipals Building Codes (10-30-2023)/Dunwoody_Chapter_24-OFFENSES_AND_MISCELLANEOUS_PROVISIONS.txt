Material is obscene if:

It is an affirmative defense under this section that selling, lending, renting, leasing, giving, advertising, publishing, exhibiting, or otherwise disseminating the material was restricted to:
(1)
A person associated with an institution of higher learning, either as a member of the faculty or a matriculated student, teaching or pursuing a course of study related to such material; or
(2)
A person whose receipt of such material was authorized in writing by a licensed medical practitioner or psychiatrist.

(f)
Accepted graffiti removal products.
(1)
The planning and zoning department shall maintain a list of substances designated as acceptable products to remove specific types of graffiti from specific surfaces (unpainted brick, concrete, stone, etc.). This list shall include detailed information on the appropriate use of such designated substances. Appropriate use of said substances by property owners shall constitute compliance with the requirement to remove graffiti contained therein.
(2)

Sec. 24-68. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The mayor and city council do hereby adopt the following findings:
The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that: (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; (5) establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smokefree policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. 1
According to the 2010 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, even occasional exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful and low levels of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke lead to a rapid and sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels, which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke. 2 According to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences Smoking—50 Years of Progress, secondhand smoke exposure causes stroke in nonsmokers. The report also found that since the 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, 2.5 million nonsmokers have died from diseases caused by tobacco smoke. 3
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately 53,000 Americans annually. 4
The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. 5
Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women; heart disease; and death. 6
There is indisputable evidence that implementing 100 percent smoke-free environments is the only effective way to protect the population from the harmful effects of exposure to second-hand smoke. 7
In reviewing 11 studies concluding that communities see an immediate reduction in heart attach admissions after the implementation of comprehensive smokefree laws, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies concluded that data consistently demonstrate that secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks and that smokefree laws reduce heart attacks. 8
A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. 9
Studies measuring cotinine (metabolized nicotine) and NNAL (metabolized nitrosamine NNK, a tobacco-specific carcinogen linked to lung cancer) in hospitality workers find dramatic reductions in the levels of these biomarkers after a smokefree law takes effect. Average cotinine levels of New York City restaurant and bar workers decreased by 85 percent after the city's smokefree law went into effect. 10 After the implementation of Ontario, Canada's Smokefree Indoor Air Law, levels of NNAL were reduced by 52 percent in nonsmoking casino employees and cotinine levels fell by 98 percent. 11
Smokefree indoor air laws result in a significant reduction in fine particulate matter and improved air quality. A Grand Rapids, Michigan study that monitored six restaurants before and after implementation of the state's smokefree air law found that PM2.5 fine particulate matter was reduced by 92 percent after the law went into effect, indicating that the vast majority of indoor air pollution in all six venues was due to secondhand smoke. The results in Grand Rapids were consistent with results in Wilmington, Delaware; Boston, Massachusetts; and Western New York. 12
Following a Health Hazard Evaluation of Las Vegas casino employees' secondhand smoke exposure in the workplace, which included indoor air quality tests and biomarker assessments, the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) concluded that the casino employees are exposed to dangerous levels of secondhand smoke at work and that their bodies absorb high levels of tobacco-specific chemicals NNK and cotinine during work shifts. NIOSH also concluded that the "best means of eliminating workplace exposure to [secondhand smoke] is to ban all smoking in the casinos." 13 A subsequent study in Nevada, whose Clean Indoor Air Act permits smoking in designated areas of casinos, bars, and taverns, indicates that strong 100 percent smokefree laws are the only effective way to protect indoor air quality. The study sampled the air quality in 15 casino gaming areas and corresponding nonsmoking areas, and the results indicated that the Clean Indoor Air Act failed to protect air quality in the nonsmoking areas, including children-friendly areas. 14
Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. 15 The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. 16
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small does such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one or two cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. 17
Given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology than can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smokefree in their entirety. In 2015, ASHRAE amended its ventilation Standard for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality (62.1) to include an environment that is completely free from marijuana smoke and emissions from electronic smoking devices. 18
During periods of active smoking, peak and average outdoor tobacco smoke (OTSZ) levels measured in outdoor faces and restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor tobacco concentrations. 19 Nonsmokers who spend six-hour periods in outdoor smoking sections of bars and restaurants experience a significant increase in levels of cotinine when compared to the cotinine levels in a smokefree outdoor area. 20
Residential tobacco contamination, or "thirdhand smoke," from cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products is left behind after smoking occurs and builds up on surfaces and furnishings. This residue can linger in spaces long after smoking has ceased, continuing to expose people to tobacco toxins, which represent an unappreciated health hazard through dermal exposure, dust inhalation, and ingestion. 21 Sticky, highly toxic particulate matter, including nicotine, can cling to walls and ceilings, and gases can be absorbed into carpets, draperies, and other upholsteries, which can then be reemitted (Off-gassed) back into the air and form harmful compounds. 22 Tobacco residue is noticeably present in dust throughout places where smoking has occurred. 23 The dangers of residual tobacco contamination are present in spaces that are not 100 percent smokefree, such as in nonsmoking rooms of hotels that allow smoking in some guest rooms. Partial smoking restrictions in hotels do not protect non-smoking guests from exposure to tobacco smoke and tobacco-specific carcinogens. 24
Electronic smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or "e-cigarettes," closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid that typically contains nicotine, heated through an electronic ignition system. ESD emissions are made up of a high concentration of ultrafine particles, and the particle concentration is higher than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke. 25 The January 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine publication states that there is conclusive evidence that in addition to nicotine, most ESDs contain and emit numerous potentially toxic substances and increase airborne concentrations of particulate matter and nicotine in indoor environments. Studies show that people exposed to ESD aerosol absorb nicotine (measured as cotinine) at levels comparable to passive smokers. Many of the elements identified in the aerosol are known to cause respiratory distress and disease. ESD exposure damages lung tissues. Human lung cells that are exposed to ESD aerosol and flavorings - especially cinnamon - show increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. 26 Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. The World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSHY), and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) recommend that ESDs not be used in smokefree environments, in order to minimize the risk to bystanders of breathing in the aerosol emitted by the devices and to avoid undermining the enforcement of smokefree laws. 27
Secondhand smoke from combusted marijuana contains fine particulate matter that can be breathed deeply into the lungs, which can cause lung irritation and asthma attacks, thus making respiratory infections more likely. Exposure to fine particulate matter can exacerbate health problems, especially for people with respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or COPD. 28, 29 Secondhand smoke from marijuana also has many of the same chemicals as smoke from tobacco, including those linked to lung cancer. 30, 31 More research is needed, but the current body of science shows that both tobacco and marijuana smoke may have similar harmful cardiovascular effects. 32, 33 Thus, in the interest of public health, the use of combustible or aerosolized marijuana should be prohibited wherever tobacco smoking is prohibited.
The Society of Actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly $10 billion a year: $5 billion in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and $4.6 billion in lost productivity. 34
Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree. Creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. 35
There is no legal or constitutional "right to smoke." 36 Business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. On the contrary, employers have a common law duty to provide workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous. 37
Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. 38
The smoking of tobacco, hookahs, or marijuana and the use of ESDs are forms of air pollution and constitute both a danger to health and a material public nuisance.
Accordingly, the City of Dunwoody Mayor and Council finds and declares that the purposes of this ordinance are: (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.
