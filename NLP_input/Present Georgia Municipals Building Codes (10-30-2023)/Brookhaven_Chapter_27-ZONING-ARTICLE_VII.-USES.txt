DIVISION 3. - USE CLASSIFICATIONS

Sec. 27-573. - General.
This division describes the system used to classify principal uses in this zoning ordinance.

Sec. 27-574. - Use categories.
This zoning ordinance classifies principal land uses into five major groupings). These major groupings are referred to as "use categories." The use categories are as follows:

Sec. 27-575. - Use subcategories.
Each use category is further divided into more specific "subcategories." Use subcategories classify principal land uses and activities based on common functional, product or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.145), 11-27-2018)
Sec. 27-576. - Specific use types.
Some use subcategories are further broken down to identify specific types of uses that are regulated differently than the subcategory as a whole.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.146), 11-27-2018; Ord. No. 2019-04-02 , § II, 4-23-2019; Ord. No. 2019-05-03 , § I(Attch.), 5-28-2019)
Sec. 27-577. - Determination of use categories and subcategories.
(a)
The community development director is authorized to classify uses on the basis of the use category, subcategory and specific use type descriptions of this article.
(b)
When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a use category, subcategory or specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the community development director is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most appropriate use category, subcategory or specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use category, subcategory and specific use type descriptions provided in this article. In making such determinations, the community development director shall consider:
(1)
The types of activities that typically occur in conjunction with the use;
(2)
The types of equipment and processes to be used;
(3)
The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or employees;
(4)
Parking demands or the use; and
(5)
Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination.
(c)
If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the community development director is authorized to categorize each use in the category, subcategory or specific use type that provides the most exact, narrowest and appropriate "fit."

b.
Sexually oriented businesses, as a subcategory of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
c.
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
d.
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
e.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
(3)
Prohibited locations. It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in the city that is located:
a.
Within 100 feet of another sexually oriented business; or
b.
Within 300 feet of a residential district, religious assembly use, park, or public library.
(4)
Measurements.
a.
Measurement of the required spacing between sexually oriented businesses shall be made in a straight line without regard to intervening structures or objects, between the closest points on the property lines of the two sexually oriented businesses.
b.
Measurement of the required spacing between a sexually oriented business and a residential district, religious assembly use, park, or public library shall be made in a straight line without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest part of the structure containing the sexually oriented business to the closest point on the boundary line of the residential district or the closest point on the property line of the religious assembly use, park, or public library.
