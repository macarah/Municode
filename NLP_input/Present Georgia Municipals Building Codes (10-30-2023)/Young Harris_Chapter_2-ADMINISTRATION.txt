--- (3) ---
State Law reference— Code of ethics for government service, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 et seq.

Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 2-96. - Purpose.
The purpose of this code of ethics is to:
(1)
Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interests of the city;
(3)
Require disclosure by such officials of private financial interest of an official or an immediate family member of an official in matters affecting the city; and
(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
(Ord. of 12-6-2016, § 1.1)
Sec. 2-97. - Scope.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the city Charter shall control in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics.
(Ord. of 12-6-2016, § 1.2)
Sec. 2-98. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
The proper government and administration of the city requires that:
(1)
Its officials, employees, appointees, and volunteers conducting official city business, including those appointed by city council, as a group and as individuals subscribe to the following ethics and principles:
a.
Serve others and not themselves;
b.
Be independent, impartial and responsible;
c.
Use resources with efficiency and economy;
d.
Treat all people fairly;
e.
Use the power of their position for the well-being of their constituents;
f.
Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity;
(2)
Governmental policies and decisions are made in the proper channels of the government structure;
(3)
Public office and employment not to be used for undue personal gain; and
(4)
The citizens of the city have confidence in the integrity of their government.
(b)
Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of city officials and employees, the public interest mandates that the city prevent such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of its officials and employees in situations in which a conflict may exist.
(c)
It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust and also to recognize that the relationships created by a small community do not always create an ethical conflict. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this division must be understood and interpreted in a way that will not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire to seek public office by those best qualified to serve. To that end, officials and employees should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other financial interests except when a personal financial conflict would necessarily result.
(d)
The policy and purpose of this division, therefore, is to clarify those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the officials and employees of the city in the discharge of their public duties and to foster the development and maintenance of a tradition of responsible and effective public service.
(Ord. of 12-6-2016, § 1.3)

In such a case, the complainant must file a written complaint with the city clerk no later than 90 days after the complainant discovered the alleged violation. In all such cases brought after 90 days from the date of the alleged ethical violation, the complaint bears the burden of convincing the board of the true date complainant learned of the alleged violation.

c.
The city clerk shall serve as the recording secretary to the board and shall provide such administrative services to the board as may be necessary.
(d)
Dismissal of frivolous complaints. Within 30 days of convening, the board may perform one or more of the following:
(1)
Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, review the complaint to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. The board of ethics shall be empowered to collect evidence and information concerning any complaint and to add the findings and results of its investigation to the file containing such complaint;
(2)
Upon completion of its review and/or investigation of a complaint, the board may recommend at a public meeting that the council dismiss those complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or which fail to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. Provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in equity against the respondent government servant.

The advisory opinion shall be written unless it is given verbally during a public meeting, and may be provided directly to the requestor of such opinion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a request for an informal opinion by any public servant from the city attorney regarding a potential conflict of interest. Neither a request for an informal opinion, nor the making of a statement concerning a potential conflict of interest made by a member of the governing body in the course of abstaining from voting shall create a presumption or inference that a public servant actually has a personal financial interest in the matter about which the opinion was requested. An advisory opinion of the city attorney shall be considered a conclusion of law regarding the application of this attorney.

At the hearing the conduct of the parties shall be dignified both on and off the record. Misconduct before the board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges, and the alleged misconduct of others who may have escaped discipline in the past shall serve as no defense. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the board. It should be recognized that the board will be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable, but shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and assign such weight as may be warranted and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues. The board may decline to listen to numerous character witnesses or numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts.
(b)
The chairman of the board of ethics shall conduct the hearing.
(c)
The hearing shall be recorded and the city clerk shall prepare a written summary of hearing. The complainant and/or respondent may provide a court reporter at their expense for a verbatim transcript of the hearing, if so desired. The city clerk, or their designee, shall take minutes of the hearing, specifically including the name of the board members who make any motions as to recommendations, the board members who second any such motions, and the names of individuals on the board and how each voted. This written recommendation shall be presented to the city council at the conclusion of the board's proceedings.
(d)
A quorum of the board shall be required to conduct the hearing. A quorum shall be defined as two members. The ethics board may, before the hearing and upon ten days' notice to all parties, approve regulations governing the conduct of ethics board hearings so long as such regulations do not conflict with this section.
(e)
The person who filed the complaint (complainant) shall present his case to the board first.
(f)
All documentary evidence which is anticipated to be submitted to the board at the hearing by either the respondent or the complainant, and the names, with telephone numbers, of all individuals expected to present testimony to the board on behalf of either the respondent or complainant, must be given to the city clerk at least ten days in advance of the hearing. This requirement shall not apply to evidence used solely for purposes of rebuttal. The failure of a party to adhere to this rule shall preclude such party from tendering such evidence or individual's testimony at the hearing through any form. The respondent, complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such lists which are placed on file with the city clerk.
(g)
The board may compel the production of any document in possession of the city and subject to the Open Records Act and the testimony of any city employee except where the employee is the respondent.
(h)
Neither party shall have the right to require depositions of any individual, including the opposite party. The respondent and complainant shall have the right to obtain affidavits which may be submitted to the board for consideration provided that such affidavits were filed with the city clerk no less than 48 hours prior to the hearing, and the name of the affiant is provided to the city clerk. Both the respondent, the complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such affidavits, which are placed on file with the city clerk.
(i)
The complainant's evidence must prove that respondent is guilty of the offense as charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred to as "preponderance of the evidence."
(j)
Each witness presented by the complainant, and including the complainant, shall be subject to cross-examination by the individual accused of the ethical violation ("respondent") or such person's representative.
(k)
At the conclusion of the complainant's case, the respondent shall be entitled to move for dismissal based on insufficient evidence on the part of complaint's case. If respondent makes such a motion and the board, by majority vote, agrees to dismiss the complaint, the hearing shall be terminated at this point. If either the respondent fails to make such a motion, or, or if the board decides by majority vote to overrule respondent's motion, the hearing shall continue. The board may also direct a decision in favor of the respondent upon the board's own initiative.
(l)
Respondent shall be entitled to present his evidence to the board.
(m)
Respondent is not required to testify. The absence of respondent's testimony shall not be viewed by the board as an admission of any sort.
(n)
If respondent testifies, then respondent shall be subject to cross-examination by complainant. All other witnesses who testify in the respondent's case shall be subject to cross-examination by complainant.
(o)
All persons who testify before the board shall be placed under oath, by either the chairman or a person designated by the chairman. The oath shall read substantially as follows: "Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give in this matter (name matter) shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?"
(p)
At the conclusion of respondent's case, the complainant may offer rebuttal evidence only to those items presented in respondent's case. At the conclusion of complainant's rebuttal, respondent shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence only to those matters presented in complainant's rebuttal case.
(q)
During the course of testimony and at the conclusion of all the testimony and closure of all of the evidence, the board members may ask questions of any of the individuals who testify before the board.
(r)
At the conclusion of all questions by parties and board members, the chairman shall end the hearing and permit the board to deliberate in public. If the board decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the board shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require the complainant or respondent to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The board has no authority to continue the hearing past this 45-day deadline.
(s)
Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the board shall continue to deliberate. When deliberations are concluded, the chairman shall call for a vote. The board may vote immediately after deliberations are concluded or they may continue meeting for up to two weeks when a public vote must be taken. The board's first vote must be whether to recommend that the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the board makes a recommendation that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the board, by majority vote, makes a recommendation that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the board must make a second recommendation by majority vote. The second recommendation involves the recommended form of penalty. The board shall have four options of recommended penalties, which include:
(1)
No administration and no further action;
(2)
A public reprimand and admonishment not to violate the ethics code in the future;
(3)
Public censure; and
(4)
Recommendation for termination or resignation.
(t)
The complainant may withdraw his complaint at any time without the approval of the board.
(u)
If any questions concerning the hearing procedures arise, which are not otherwise addressed in this subdivision, the city attorney shall resolve the procedural question. Such resolutions shall be placed in writing by the city attorney and given to both parties. Such resolution shall also be presented to the board for final approval and recommendation to amend the article by adding such procedure.
(v)
A recommendation will be generated by the board and submitted to the city council for inclusion in the minutes in the first regular council meeting following the conclusion of the hearing.
(w)
Upon receipt of the findings and recommendations of the board of ethics, the city council may invoke the following penalties for violation of this subdivision:
(1)
No admonishment and no further action;
(2)
A public reprimand and admonishment not to violate the ethics code in the future;
(3)
Public censure; and
(4)
Recommendation for termination or resignation

Sec. 2-221. - Purchasing generally.
All purchases for the city shall be approved by the city council. However, the city council may delegate the purchase of equipment, vehicles or other matters not required by state law to be done through competitive bidding.

Price;
(2)
Availability and flexibility of the vendor on beginning and completion dates;

(b)
Notwithstanding any other section of this Code, when the mayor, or in his absence the mayor pro tem, determines that an emergency exists, the mayor may make or authorize others to make emergency procurements for supplies, services, construction items, or professional or consultant services.
