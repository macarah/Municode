Dawson County may, no more than once annually, audit the business records of the state franchise holder to the extent necessary to ensure payment of the franchise fee to Dawson County. For purposes of this subjection, an audit shall be defined as a comprehensive review of the records of the holder of a state franchise. Once any audited period of a state franchise holder has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such state franchise holder shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of the franchise fee due to the county under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the county seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a state franchise holder seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates. Such time period may be extended by written agreement between the state issued franchise holder and such affected local governing authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any such examination or dispute. In the event that the county files an action to recover alleged underpayments of franchise fees and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the cable service provider or video service provider has underpaid franchise fees due for any 12 month period by ten percent or more, the cable service provider or video service provider may be required to pay the county its reasonable costs associated with the audit along with any franchise fee underpayments; provided, however, late payments shall not apply.

Payments.

Any amount overpaid by the holder of the state franchise shall be deducted from future franchise payments.
(e)
Effective date. The effective date of the resolution from which this section is derived shall be January 2, 2008.
