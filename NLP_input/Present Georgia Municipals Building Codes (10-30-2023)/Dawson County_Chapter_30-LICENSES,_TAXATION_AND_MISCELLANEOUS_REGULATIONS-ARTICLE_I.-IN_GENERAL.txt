Such time period may be extended by written agreement between the state issued franchise holder and such affected local governing authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any such examination or dispute. In the event that the county files an action to recover alleged underpayments of franchise fees and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the cable service provider or video service provider has underpaid franchise fees due for any 12 month period by ten percent or more, the cable service provider or video service provider may be required to pay the county its reasonable costs associated with the audit along with any franchise fee underpayments; provided, however, late payments shall not apply.

(e)
Effective date. The effective date of the resolution from which this section is derived shall be January 2, 2008.
