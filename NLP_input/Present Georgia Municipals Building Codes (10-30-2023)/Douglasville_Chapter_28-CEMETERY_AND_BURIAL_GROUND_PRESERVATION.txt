Chapter 28 - CEMETERY AND BURIAL GROUND PRESERVATION
ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT; DEFINITIONS

Sec. 28-1. - Purpose and intent.
The City of Douglasville has been richly blessed with the heritage and history of its people who are now deceased, and many of those who passed on have been memorialized with resting places in cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds that have been abandoned and are threatened by unknowing development. Human remains and burial objects are not property to be owned by the person or entity which owns the land or water where the human remains and burial objects are interred or discovered, but are a part of the finite, irreplaceable and non-renewable cultural heritage of the citizens of Douglasville which should be preserved. The care accorded the remains of deceased persons reflects respect and regard for human dignity as well as cultural, spiritual, and religious values. Therefore, it is the desire of the mayor and council of the City of Douglasville to provide for the preservation of all such cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds. The mayor and council of the City of Douglasville hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a commission for the purpose of providing a procedure for the identification of abandoned cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds. It is further the purpose and intent of this article to establish a uniform procedure for the processing of applications to disturb and relocate human remains and burial objects in conformity with state and local law.

Sec. 28-20. - Fifty-foot buffer for known cemeteries or burial grounds.
No owner or occupier of property shall knowingly disturb or allow to be disturbed any property located within 50 feet of any grave site within any known cemetery or burial ground unless a burial disturbance permit is first obtained or an alternative protective buffer is established by the city engineer as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. No. O-96-39, § 1, 7-22-96)
Sec. 28-21. - Notification of discovery or disturbance of cemeteries or burial grounds.

Sec. 28-22. - Suspension of development or activity upon disturbance of human remains of burial objects; establishment of protective buffer.
(a)
When human remains or burial objects are disturbed without a burial disturbance permit in the course of development of any tract of property, whether through discovery of a previously unknown cemetery or burial ground or otherwise, all activities that may affect the cemetery or burial ground shall immediately cease. When any cemetery or burial ground has been so disturbed in the course of development, after the discovering party has notified the city police department and the city engineer of the discovery, the owner or agent of the property, at his or her own expense, shall immediately apply for a burial disturbance permit and take steps to determine the estimated number of graves on the owner's property and their approximate location on the property through an archaeologist. Once the archaeologist has established the approximate boundaries of the cemetery or burial ground on the disturbed property, a protective buffer shall be determined by the city engineer.
(b)
Any owner or occupier of property desiring to develop the same within 50 feet of the outer boundary of any grave site within any cemetery or burial ground may apply for establishment of a protective buffer by the city engineer, as an alternative to the 50-foot buffer otherwise imposed by this chapter. Upon application, it shall be within the discretion of the city engineer to establish a protective buffer less than 50 feet around the perimeter of the cemetery or burial site.
(c)
In determining the appropriate protective buffer, the city engineer shall consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:
(1)
The slope of the land in and surrounding the boundaries;
(2)
The proximity of the burial around or cemetery to any floodplains;
(3)

The natural vegetation within and surrounding the boundaries;
(5)
The nature of any land-disturbing or development activity in the area adjacent to the boundaries; and
(6)
Any other factors determined relevant by the city engineer.
(d)
No activity may occur on the property where the cemetery or burial ground is discovered that will cause the destruction, defacement, mutilation, removal, or exposure of a burial place pending the application and appeal period.
(e)
No activity shall resume within the protective buffer unless:
(1)
Authorization is received from the city engineer or his or her designee; or
(2)
The burial disturbance permit application and appeal period is completed and the activity is in compliance:

With the terms of an approved burial disturbance permit as issued by the city council or as modified by the superior court or other reviewing court; and
b.
With any applicable provisions of the Code of Douglasville, including but not limited to the soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance and the zoning ordinance.
