Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 2-42. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
In furtherance of its responsibility to protect the integrity of government and administration of the county and recognizing that its system of representative government is dependent upon the people maintaining the highest trust in their public officials, the board of commissioners finds and declares that the people have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent judgment of public officials will be maintained. Public interest requires that the county protect against improper influence or the appearance of improper influence by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of public officials. Officers by their conduct should avoid the appearance of impropriety.
(b)
It is essential to the efficient operation of government that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. It is the intention of the board of commissioners that this division be construed to accomplish this purpose and interpreted and understood as not unreasonably to frustrate or impede the desire or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve. To that end public officials should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest would necessarily result.
(c)
The policy and purpose of this ethics code, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to public officials in the discharge of their official duties; to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of the county's government and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflict of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.
(d)
The county attorney shall make a good-faith effort to review this ethics code with each officer within 30 days following such officer's swearing-in.

Sec. 2-44. - Disciplinary action.
(a)
In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a person who is subject to the provisions of this division and who is found by the board of ethics to have violated its provisions may, in the case of a public official, be subject to censure or reprimand.
(b)
Upon direction of the board of ethics, a petition may be filed for injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief, in the county superior court, or in any other court having proper venue and jurisdiction, for the purpose of requiring compliance with the provisions of this division. In addition, the court may issue an order to cease and desist from the violation of this division. The court also may void an official action taken by any official which action was prohibited by this division, provided that the legal action to void the matter was brought within 90 days of the occurrence of the official action, if the court deems voiding the action to be in the best interest of the public. The court, after hearing and considering all the circumstances in the case, may grant all or part of the relief sought. However, the court may not void any official action appropriating public funds, levying taxes or providing for the issuance of bonds, notes or other evidences of public obligation.

Sec. 2-46. - Impartiality.
(a)
Officers must not take part in any personal, business, or professional activity or receive or retain any direct or indirect financial interest that places them in a position of conflict between their private interest and public interest that relates to their responsibilities and duties as officers.
(b)
Officers must not use their positions to induce, coerce or influence a person or employee, including subordinates, in a way that would provide any benefits, financial or otherwise, to themselves or to other individuals or to any for-profit organization of which they are a member.

(b)
Except as otherwise provided by law, no officer shall, in such capacity, participate in the discussion, debate, deliberation or vote, or otherwise take part in the decision-making process on any item before the officer in which the officer has a conflict of interest as defined above.
(c)
To avoid the appearance of impropriety, if any officer has a conflict of interest or has an interest that the officer has reason to believe either violates this code of ethics or may affect the officer's official acts or actions in any matter, the officer shall immediately leave the meeting room, except that if the matter is being considered at a public meeting, the officer may remain in the area of the room occupied by the general public. In the event of such conflict of interest, the officer shall leave the officer's regular seat as a member of the board, and not return to it until deliberation and action on the matter is completed. Nothing herein shall require the officer to leave while action is taken for any item for which the officer has a conflict of interest which is contained on a "consent agenda" and upon which there is no deliberation provided the officer's conflict has been disclosed and the officer abstains from voting on the item on the "consent agenda."
(d)
It is hereby declared that it is not the intent of this ethics code to prohibit an immediate relative of an officer from being engaged in gainful employment in this county.

Sec. 2-78. - Complaints.
The board of ethics shall be responsible for hearing and deciding any complaints filed regarding alleged violation of code sections 2-45 through 2-56 by any person. The following procedure shall be followed when filing a complaint:
(1)
Any person may file a complaint alleging violation of any of the provisions of this division by filing it with the clerk of the board of commissioners, who shall immediately deliver such complaint to the chairman of the board of ethics or his designee. A copy of such complaint shall immediately be forwarded by registered mail to the commissioner against whom the complaint was filed. The complaint must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit(s) should be attached to the affidavit(s). The person filing the complaint shall verify at the time of filing that he or she is qualified, pursuant to section 2-41, to file a complaint.
(2)
A complaint must be filed within six months of the date the alleged violation is said to have occurred, or in case of concealment or nondisclosure within six months of the date the alleged violation should have been discovered after due diligence. As a threshold matter, prior to any other review of a complaint, the board of ethics shall dismiss a complaint which is untimely filed.
(3)
Subsequent to establishing the complaint has been timely filed, in the event the board of ethics makes a determination that a complaint is technically deficient, the board of ethics shall submit a list of deficiencies to the complainant and offer the complainant the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within seven days prior to the board of ethics' investigatory review of the complaint.
(4)
Upon receipt of a complaint alleging misconduct, the public officer against whom the complaint was filed may reply to the complaint within 30 days, unless such time for reply is shortened or extended by the board of ethics. Such public officer's response must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, must set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit(s) should be attached to the affidavit(s).
(5)
Within 60 days of receipt of a complaint, the board of ethics shall conduct an investigatory review to determine whether specific substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this division. If, after reviewing the complaint the board of ethics by majority vote determines that no specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this division or determines that no violation occurred, it may dismiss the complaint. In the event a complaint is dismissed on the basis of a deficiency in the form of the complaint, rather than upon the merits of the complaint, the complaint may be re-filed within 15 days of said dismissal if the deficiency in the form and pleading has been cured.
(6)
If the board of ethics determines that specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this division, certified written notice of a hearing, containing the time, date and place of such hearing, shall be given to each party by the ethics board, and a formal public hearing shall be conducted and both parties afforded an opportunity to be heard. Any formal public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process. The board of ethics is authorized to swear witnesses. Any final determination resulting from the hearing shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The board of ethics shall determine if clear and convincing evidence shows any violation of this Code.
(7)
Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit or encumber the right of the board of ethics to initiate an investigation on its own cognizance as it deems necessary to fulfill its obligations under this division.
