The director may grant partial project approval, and allow work to proceed on those portions of the project outside of the delineated wetlands, provided an alternate development plan is submitted in accordance with these regulations with ample provisions for project completion in the case that the subject wetlands disturbance is not permitted by the USACOE.
(5)

(d)
Cornish Creek, Beaverdam Creek Watershed and Hard Labor Creek Overlay Protection District (W-P2).
(1)
Purpose and intent. The intent of this land development overlay district is to protect the designated watershed areas from the possible adverse effects of residential and non-residential development such as the leaching of septic systems, increased storm water runoff, sedimentation and other sources of water pollution, in order to insure water quality. All property within this land development district shall simultaneously carry the land development district designation of the underlying land development district as well as the W-P2 designation.
(2)
Location of the district. The W-P2 watershed protection overlay district is comprised of all land areas within the Cornish Creek, Hard Labor Creek and Beaverdam Creek watershed basins, which have been officially designated for use as public water supplies. The W-P2 watershed protection district is shown on the official land development maps of Walton County, Georgia, which are adopted by reference by the city. In all cases, the watershed is defined by the ridgelines that separate the flow of storm water between the Cornish Creek, Hard Labor Creek and Beaverdam Creek watershed basins and all other watersheds. The actual boundary of W-P2 watershed protection overlay district must therefore be determined on a property-by-property basis using the actual topography of each site.
(3)
Permitted and conditional uses.

b.
Stream setback. The area extending a distance of 150 feet from the banks of all perennial streams.
c.
Water impoundment greenway. The area extending a distance of 100 feet from the normal pool elevation of any water impoundment, except that greenway requirements shall not apply adjacent to the dam side of the impoundment. The greenway shall remain natural and undisturbed except as otherwise provided in this district, below.
**In the Hard Labor Creek Reservoir, the area extending a distance of 150 feet from the normal pool elevation of any water impoundment, except greenway requirements shall not apply adjacent to the dam side of the impoundment. The greenway shall remain natural and undisturbed except as otherwise provided in this district, below.
d.
