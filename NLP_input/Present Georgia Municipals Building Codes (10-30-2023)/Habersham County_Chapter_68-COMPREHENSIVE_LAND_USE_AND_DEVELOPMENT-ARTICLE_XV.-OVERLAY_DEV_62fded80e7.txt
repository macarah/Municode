Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
(i)
Heliport transitional zones: Slopes two feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the heliport approach zones and extending a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally from and at 90 degree angles to the primary surface centerline and heliport approach zones centerline.
(j)
Horizontal zone: Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 1,598 feet above mean sea level.
(k)
Conical zone: Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

Sec. 68-1516. - Nonconforming uses.
(a)
Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this article, and is diligently prosecuted.
(b)
Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Habersham County Airport Commission to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the airport commission.

Sec. 68-1517. - Permits.
(a)
Future uses. Except as specifically provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of the land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone created in this article unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section 68-1517(d) of this chapter.
(1)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
(2)
In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
(3)
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
(4)
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article.
(b)
Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(c)
Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the administrative officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 50 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
(d)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the planning commission for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances may be allowed where it is found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the planning commission unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Habersham County Airport Commission for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Habersham County Airport Commission does not respond to the application within 30 days after receipt, the planning commission may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
(e)
Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the planning commission, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Habersham County Airport Commission, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
