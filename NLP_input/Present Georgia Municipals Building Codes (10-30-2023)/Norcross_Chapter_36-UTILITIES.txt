Sec. 36-11. - Levelized billing.
Residential customers may receive and be entitled to levelized utility billing, from month to month, subject to and upon the following terms and conditions:
(1)
Eligibility. Residential customers may receive and be entitled to levelized utility billing if:
a.
They are residential customers receiving electric and/or water/sewer service;
b.
Such customer has in writing exercised the option and elected to receive levelized billing;
c.
Such customer has maintained an account for at least 12 months with no history of late payments; and
d.
The General Government Administration Department shall concur in the delivery of levelized billing to the particular customer;
(2)
The monthly levelized billing account will be calculated by the City averaging the current month's charges with all charges for utility services for the immediate past 11 months, excluding for both periods, fixed charges as defined herein, and taxes. All appropriate taxes will be billed based on the current month actual charges and late charges will be assessed.
(3)
A penalty will not be charged to a customer on account balances. However, any levelized bill amount which is not paid by the due date will be subject to appropriate penalties. Refunds of credit balances will not be made except upon final billing. A customer may terminate eligibility for levelized billing at any time and at that time pay the balance due or receive the credit balance but in such event, the customer cannot elect to receive levelized billing for a period of at least 12 months from the date of termination;
(4)
If a utility customer shall move to a location not serviced by the city, the balance owed by such customer or the credit due to the customer will be applied to the final bill. If the final billing results in a balance due to the customer, a refund check will be issued to the customer but if there is a balance due to the city, such balance shall be due in full and shall be paid by the due date reflected on the bill;
(5)
If service to a customer shall be cut off or terminated for nonpayment, the account balance is due and must be paid prior to reconnection. Twelve consecutive months of service without termination for nonpayment shall be required before eligibility is restored;
(6)
A utility customer transferring to another eligible location serviced by the city may continue on the levelized billing plan. The billing history of the new location will be used to calculate the level payment amount. If sufficient history is not available due to prolonged vacancy or because the account is new, only the available monthly charges will be averaged and if no history is available, the first month's bill will be the actual charges and averaging will commence with the second month; and
(7)
Fixed charges as used herein means contributions to the share program, garbage collection fees and security light fees.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 36-132. - Purpose.
This article shall serve as the policy and rate ordinance for the Stormwater Utility of the city as established by the Stormwater Utility Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 16-2008, § 1, 5-5-2008)
Sec. 36-133. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Dwelling unit means a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility.
Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means 100 square feet, or any portion thereof, of horizontal impervious area on a developed property within the city as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways and sidewalks.
Nonresidential property means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a residential property.
Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The city stormwater utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose.
Residential property means improved property containing one residential structure which contains one or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A residential property may include a stick-built, industrialized, or manufactured home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a residential property, even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers' quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Residential property shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties.
(Ord. No. 16-2008, § 2, 5-5-2008)

(3)
Adjustments. The Stormwater Manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
a.
Customers who believe their stormwater user fee is incorrect may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the Stormwater Manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the Stormwater Manager including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the Stormwater Manager or his designee cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the Stormwater Manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information is received by the Stormwater Manager, the Stormwater Manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review.

Residential service. A residential service shall be defined as a single- or three-phase service to a single private house, apartment, or other living quarters occupied by a person or persons constituting a distinct household. It shall include any private garage adjacent to, connected with, and used exclusively by the resident.

Distinction between residential and commercial service. Residential service shall include, in addition to all domestic uses of energy, the use of energy for the production, processing, and/or utilization of materials produced on farms. For example, feed grinding, milk pasteurizing, poultry houses, and dairy barns will be classified as residential service. Materials produced elsewhere, as in the case of commercial feed grinding plants, commercial poultry hatcheries, creameries, etc., shall be classified as general service.
