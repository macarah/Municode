Sec. 108-42.1. - Senior Community Mixed Use District.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the Senior Community Mixed Use District (SC-MUD) is to advocate the creation and preservation of a distinct and visually harmonious community of choice that is compact, mixed-use and pedestrian friendly; and supports patterns of urbanization that are stimulating, safe and ecologically sustainable. It is further the purpose of this district to introduce urban planning techniques that will repair and transform the auto centric patterns of suburbia that produced unimaginative housing subdivisions, big box stores and a proliferation of parking areas into a complete community that is sustainable and more than capable of accommodating a diversity of income levels, building types, modes of transportation and open space. To this end, and as expressed in the comprehensive land use plan, this district seeks to enable, encourage and implement land development patterns that will purposefully integrate dwellings with open space, offices, schools and stores, resulting in the manifestation of a distinct and visually harmonious community of choice that is wholesome, sustainable and healthy.
(b)
Intent. The intent of this district is to create and to preserve a visually harmonious and orderly community that is compact, mixed-use and pedestrian friendly wherein:
(1)
An interconnected network of streets disperses traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips, while encouraging walking and bicycling as healthy and sustainable forms of transportation and recreation;
(2)
A diversity of uses enables a variety of economic, recreational, retail and residential activity;
(3)
The ordinary activities of daily living occur within walking, motorized vehicle and bicycling distance of most dwellings, allowing independence to those who do not drive automobiles, while expanding the transportation options that are available to those who do drive automobiles;
(4)
A range of housing types and price levels [to] accommodate diverse ages and incomes;
(5)
A range of open space [to] accommodate various community recreational purposes; and
(6)
Architecture and landscape designs grown from local topography, history, climate and building technique.
(7)
This district is envisioned for usage within parcels that have a nexus with a state highway or other commercial corridor.
(c)
Definitions. This division provides definitions for terms in this section that are either technical in nature or that may not reflect common usage of the term. Terms requiring interpretation specific to this section are as follows:

(Ord. No. 1902, 2-25-2019)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1902, adopted February 25, 2019, added provisions to the Code, but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been designated as § 108-42.1, as set out herein.
Sec. 108-43. - Sustainable Community Mixed Use District.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the Sustainable Community Mixed Use District (MUD) is to advocate the creation and preservation of a distinct and visually harmonious community of choice that is compact, mixed-use and pedestrian friendly; and supports patterns of urbanization that are stimulating, safe and ecologically sustainable. It is further the purpose of this district to introduce urban planning techniques that will repair and transform the auto centric patterns of suburbia that produced unimaginative housing subdivisions, big box stores and a proliferation of parking areas into a complete community that is sustainable and more than capable of accommodating a diversity of income levels, building types, modes of transportation and open space. To this end, and as expressed in the comprehensive land use plan, this district seeks to enable, encourage and implement land development patterns that will purposefully integrate dwellings with open space, offices, schools and stores, resulting in the manifestation of a distinct and visually harmonious community of choice that is wholesome, sustainable and healthy.
(b)
Intent. The intent of this district is to create and to preserve a visually harmonious and orderly community that is compact, mixed-use and pedestrian friendly wherein:
(1)
An interconnected network of streets disperse traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips, while encouraging walking and bicycling as healthy and sustainable forms of transportation and recreation;
(2)
A diversity of uses enables a variety of economic, recreational, retail and residential activity;
(3)
The ordinary activities of daily living occurs within walking and bicycling distance of most dwellings, allowing independence to those who do not drive, while expanding the transportation options that are available to those who do drive;
(4)
A range of housing types and price levels accommodate diverse ages and incomes;
(5)
A range of open spaces accommodate various community recreational purposes; and
(6)
Architecture and landscape designs grown from local topography, history, climate and building technique.
(7)
This district is envisioned for usage within parcels that have a nexus with a state highway or other commercial corridor.
(c)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(k)
Architectural standards. In furtherance of the purpose and the intent of this district, the architectural standards herein specify the configurations and techniques for building elevations, openings, roofs and other architectural elements. These architectural standards are intended to produce visual compatibility among disparate building types and uses. Because urban quality is enhanced by architectural coherence, but is not necessarily dependent on it, the provisions of these architectural standards range from liberal to strictly deterministic. To this end, the architectural aesthetic of all new buildings, and the restoration and renovation of all existing buildings, shall satisfy the following:
(1)
The principal pedestrian entrance providing access into each first floor use shall be architecturally distinguished from the other portions of the building elevation through the incorporation of accentual lighting fixtures, awnings, door patterns, glass and/or other similar architectural elements.
(2)
Blank, and unarticulated exterior walls shall be prohibited. Exterior walls facing frontage lines shall be architecturally modulated to reduce the scale of the building to human scaled proportions, and to provide for visual interest. To accomplish this, variations in architectural modulations shall occur at intervals that are no greater than 40 feet in distance.
(3)
The exteriors of all buildings shall express the construction techniques and the structural constraints of traditional and long-lasting building wall materials. With the exception of openings for doors and windows, the schedule of exterior finish materials for all buildings within this district shall be limited to: brick, cementitious board (fiber cement board panels and planks), indigenous rock, natural stone, natural wood shake, natural wood shingles, natural wood siding and/or Portland cement plaster and lathe systems (stucco).
(l)
