PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of LaGrange of a general and permanent nature.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through August 14, 1984, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in topical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of three component parts separated by dashes, the first referring to the title number, the second figure referring to the chapter number and the third figure referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 30-1 is numbered 30-1-1 and the third section of Chapter 5-1 is 5-1-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 1-1-7 and 1-1-8 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1-7.1, 1-1-7.2 and 1-1-7.3, respectively. New titles or chapters may be included by the use of numbers reserved for such purpose. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way as new sections or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Indices
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. James R. Lewis, City Attorney, Mr. Jim Hanson, City Manager, and Mr. John W. Bell, Clerk-Treasurer, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.
