Sec. 13.5-8. - Certification of appropriateness.
After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or of a historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property, or of any building, structure, site, object, landscape feature or work of art within such historic district shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner according to the DeKalb County tax records or an authorized agent unless or until an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted and approved by the preservation commission.
(1)
Application for certificate of appropriateness. Owners of historic property or of property in a historic district, or their duly authorized agents, must make application for a certificate of appropriateness on forms and according to procedures promulgated by the preservation commission for such purpose. The Georgia Department of Transportation and contractors performing work funded by the Georgia Department of Transportation are exempt from provisions of this chapter. Local governments are also exempt from obtaining certificates of appropriateness but shall notify the preservation commission at least forty-five (45) days prior to beginning or undertaking any work that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness, so as to allow the preservation commission an opportunity to comment. All applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be accompanied by drawings, photographs, plans and documentation as required by the preservation commission. Written authorization of the property owner shall be required if the applicant is not the owner of record.
(2)
Public notice. Prior to reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the preservation commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by the application (i.e. any owner of adjoining property or owner of property whose property line is within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the applicant's property according to the DeKalb County tax records) and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the preservation commission deems it necessary, or upon the written request of the applicant or an abutting property owner, the preservation commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the application. A request for public hearing must be made by the applicant at the time of filing the application or by an abutting property owner within three (3) days of receipt of notice that an application is pending before the commission. Written notice of a public hearing shall be mailed by the preservation commission to all owners and occupants of the proposed property and all abutting property owners as shown by the DeKalb County tax records not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) days prior to the date set for hearing of the application.
(3)
Review of applications. When reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness, the preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; scale; height; setback; landscaping; general design; arrangement; texture and materials of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style; and pertinent features of other properties in the immediate neighborhood. When considering applications for existing buildings, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guideline for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings, shall be used as a guideline. All local guidelines must be adopted in accordance with federal guidelines.
(4)
Interior changes. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the preservation commission shall not consider interior arrangements or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features. The preservation commission may delegate the responsibility for determining the extent of interior change and its effect on the exterior appearance to the planning director or his designee.
(5)
Demolition. A decision may be made by the preservation commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites or objects.
(6)
Ordinary maintenance and repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic property, that does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, is excluded from review.
(7)
Approval. The preservation commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. The preservation commission may approve the application as proposed, approve it with modifications, or deny the application. The preservation commission shall approve, approve with modifications or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days after the filing thereof by the applicant unless an extension is requested by the applicant and granted by the preservation commission. Evidence of approval shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the preservation commission. Failure of the preservation commission to act within said forty-five (45) days shall constitute approval and a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued.
(8)
Final action. The preservation commission's decision, whether to accept or reject an application shall be in writing. The written decision shall be signed by the chair, or the vice-chair, or a designee and must clearly set forth the reasons for the decision, including whether the guidelines have been met and specifically which factors, as set forth in section 13.5-8(3), were considered in reaching the decision. Approval of an application shall also result in the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent to the applicant and all other persons who have filed a written request for such notice with the preservation commission. All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate and by other applicable laws. In the event work is performed which is not in accordance with such certificate or laws, the county shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within twelve (12) months of the date of the issuance and completed within eighteen (18) months of the date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness are not renewable.
(9)
Revised applications. The preservation commission may suggest alternative courses of action if it denies the application submitted. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after making such modifications as suggested by the preservation commission.
(10)
Prohibition on issuance of development permits. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a property or structure, which would require the issuance of a permit of any kind, the denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding upon the county and no permit related to the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the county.
(11)
Official record. The preservation commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all the preservation commission's proceedings in connection with applications. Such records shall be maintained by the planning director. In the event of an appeal to the governing authority, the official record of the preservation commission's decision shall consist of the application, any accompanying drawings, renderings or photographs, written comments from planning department staff, written comments of any participant at the hearing before the commission and the preservation commission's written decision. Such records shall be available for review in the planning department within ten (10) days of a final decision by the preservation commission on the certificate of appropriateness.
(12)
Appeal to the governing authority. The applicant or any owner of property whose property line is within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of the applicant's property may appeal any decision made by the preservation commission to the governing authority. The appeal shall be limited to a review of the record of the proceedings before the preservation commission. The standard of review shall be an abuse of discretion.

If the governing authority finds no abuse of discretion, then it may affirm the decision of the preservation commission.

In granting variations, the preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall be a situation beyond the control of the applicant, which is a problem unique to a specific property or in order to comply with this chapter, the person will violate another ordinance of DeKalb County.
