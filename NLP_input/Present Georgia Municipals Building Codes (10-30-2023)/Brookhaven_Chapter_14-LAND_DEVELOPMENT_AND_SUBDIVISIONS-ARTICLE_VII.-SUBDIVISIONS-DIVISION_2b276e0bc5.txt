Sec. 14-194. - Power and duty of the city council to hear concurrent variances and the board of appeals to hear variances; criteria to be used in deciding variances, and appeals.
(a)
The city council or the board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of division 1 of this article VII, known as the subdivision regulations of city, where strict application of any regulation enacted in division 3 of this article VII would result in exceptional and undue hardship to the owner of such property. These regulations provide the minimum necessary requirements for subdivisions in city; thus, variances from the requirements of division 3 of this article VII shall be authorized only upon making all of the following findings:
(1)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of division 3 of this article VII would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners in the same zoning district;
(2)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for development under any design configuration allowed by these subdivision regulations unless a variance is granted;
(3)
The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute the grant of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other property owners in the zoning district in which the subject property is located;
(4)
The requested variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and
(5)
The requested variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of chapter 27 or the official zoning map of the city.
(b)
No variance shall be granted to:
(1)
Allow any variance which conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a special land use permit by the city council;
(2)
Increase the density allowed on the property; or
(3)
Vary the requirements set forth in sections 14-454 through 14-458.
(c)
Applications for a variance may be submitted to the community development director, or his designee. At a minimum, the variance application must contain a full explanation of the reasons for the variance and must include a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed without the variance and a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed with the variance.
(d)
Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the applications for variances for the preliminary plat shall be heard pursuant to chapter 27. All land development activity associated with a proposed variance from a preliminary plat shall cease until a final decision on the variance is made by the board of appeals.
(e)
The board of appeals shall issue a final decision on a variance from the preliminary plat within 60 days after the first public hearing on the variance. If a final decision is not made on a subdivision plat variance in accordance with the time constraints set forth in this section, the variance shall stand disapproved.
(f)
Appeals of variances shall be made by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. Any person or entity aggrieved by a variance decision may appeal such decision by filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. A person shall be considered aggrieved for purposes of this subsection only if:
(1)
Said person or the person's property was the subject of the action appealed from; or
(2)
Said person has a substantial interest in the action appealed from that is in danger of suffering special damage or injury not common to all property owners similarly situated.
