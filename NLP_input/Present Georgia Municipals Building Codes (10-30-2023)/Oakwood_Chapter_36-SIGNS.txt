A sign that changes no more frequently than once every 24 hours shall not be considered a changing sign. A changing sign shall include electronic message boards and changeable copy signs.

(Ord. No. 426, § 102, 2-14-2005; Amd. No. 426, § 1, 12-10-2007; Ord. of 3-9-2003(2), §§ 1, 2)
Sec. 36-20. - Findings.
(a)
The city's population and the surrounding areas of the county have grown substantially in the past decade. The result is that the major thoroughfares of the city have experienced a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic along with significant increases in automobile collisions. The regulations in this article are designed to promote the public health and safety by controlling number, placement, size and height of signs to prevent excessive and undue distraction to motorists and pedestrians and to prevent traffic hazards.
(b)
The city is an attractive and pleasant community with a small town atmosphere where various and diverse businesses have located. The city recognizes the need of these businesses to advertise products and services. The city also finds that it is in the best interests of all property owners, residents and businesses to avoid an environment that encourages visual blight and seek to encourage an attractive suburban environment. As a result, the city must balance the needs of business against the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values and enhance public safety.
(c)
The city further finds that uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial and noncommercial information to the motoring public, to promote public safety, is essential. Regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.
(Ord. No. 426, § 101(A), 2-14-2005)
Sec. 36-21. - Intent and purpose.
(a)
Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs that will:
(1)
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
(3)
Restrict signs and lights that increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision.
(4)
Promote signs that are compatible with their surroundings.
(b)
It is also the purpose of this article to ensure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
(Ord. No. 426, § 101(B), 2-14-2005)
Sec. 36-22. - Permits.
(a)
Except as specifically excluded from the provisions of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to post, display, substantially change, or erect a sign in the city without first having obtained a sign permit.
(b)
Existing signs that conform to the provisions of this article that would be required to obtain a permit under the regulations of this article must register with the city to establish that conformity. Failure to register shall not render the sign illegal; however, failure to register the sign shall shift the burden of proof of conformity with the sign regulations in effect at the time of the erection and initial permitting of the sign to the sign owner/property owner. The information provided for registration will be the same information required in a permit application under section 36-23. No permit fee will be required for the registration of existing signs.

h.
No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion, video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two fully illuminated static message displays in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message.
i.
No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display.
j.
No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Such display or effect shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section.
k.
All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light level changes so that brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The failure of an electronically changed sign to appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section.
l.
No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Any such condition resulting from a malfunction shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section.

q.
Permit applications for electronically changed signs must also include a certification from the owner or operator of the sign stating that the sign shall at all times be operated in accordance with this part and that the owner or operator shall provide proof of such conformance upon request of the city. Whether the sign is programmed from the site or from a remote location, the computer interface or other method that programs or controls the changing of the sign copy shall be available for inspection upon the request of the city so that the city can determine the messages being displayed. If the information from the computer interface or other control method is not immediately available, the sign shall cease operation until such access can be provided.
r.
Any general advertising sign which applies to employ changing sign technology shall be required to include as a part of its application a statement which shall indicate that the applicant is willing to allow law enforcement agencies to utilize its display capabilities to disseminate emergency messages on a temporary basis.
s.
Due to the limitation on distances between certain electronic changing signs, an approved application to employ changing sign technology must be acted upon within the time frames stated on the sign permit. After expiration of the permit, a new application for the location shall be required and the expired permit shall be not considered to bar location of other changing signs due to distance requirements under this part. The city may issue one extension of 60 days for good cause as shown in writing by the permit holder prior to the expiration of the original permit.
