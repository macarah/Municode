Sec. 32-19. - Findings and purpose.
The mayor and city council hereby find the following:
(1)
Tobacco smoking has long been recognized as a leading cause of death in the United States: It is responsible for almost half a million deaths each year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tobacco smoking causes cancer in the lungs, larynx, and throat. Additionally, smoking can cause respiratory illnesses and places smokers at greater risk for developing heart disease. As the evidence is overwhelming that smoking causes cancer, there is also concern that nonsmokers exposed to others' tobacco smoke may also be at risk. The smoke that filters into these environments has been labeled as passive smoke or secondhand smoke. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that secondhand smoke is deadly. It causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths and 35,000 heart disease deaths in nonsmokers each year.
(2)
The technical term for passive or secondhand smoke is environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which has been labeled one of the most widespread and harmful of all indoor pollutants by the EPA in its June 1989 publication Indoor Air Facts No. 5: Environmental Tobacco Smoke. ETS is contrasted with mainstream smoke (MS) which is the smoke that is inhaled by the smoker through the mouthpiece, filter, or end of a lit tobacco product. MS and ETS possess the same chemical makeup and potential toxicity, although MS is the more direct means of inhaling the carcinogenic and toxic agents found in tobacco products. ETS is defined by the EPA to include both the secondhand smoke which is exhaled by smokers and the side stream smoke which is emitted from the burning end of cigarettes, cigars and pipes. The EPA estimates that one-half of the smoke emitted from a burning tobacco product is side stream smoke. The same carcinogens and toxins exist in both ETS and MS, regardless of the type of tobacco product being smoked.
(3)
In January 1993, the EPA designated ETS as a Class A known human carcinogen and concluded that it was responsible for approximately 3,000 deaths a year due to lung cancer. At that time, the EPA also summarized the health risks from exposure to ETS, which contains over 4,000 compounds, many of which are known or suspected human carcinogens themselves and other toxic agents. The EPA concluded that exposure to ETS had a significant public health impact including risk of lung cancer, increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, especially to infants and children, increased prevalence of fluid in the middle ear, symptoms of upper respiratory tract irritation, a small but significant decrease in lung function, especially in children, increased severity of symptoms of asthma and increased risk of asthma in people who had not previously displayed symptoms. An EPA research report, Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders, Environmental protection Agency, December 1992, (EPA study), concluded that nearly all Americans are exposed to ETS in the home, at work, or in public places.
(4)
The mayor and city council have a duty in promulgating effective laws to protect the health, safety and welfare of it citizens as well as visitors to the city. It is the city council's intention to prohibit smoking in public places and the workplace, including particular prohibitions which will help protect children and nonsmoking adults from the health hazards presented by exposure to ETS.
(5)
Accordingly, the mayor and city council find and declare that the purposes of this article are:
a.
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and
b.
To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.
