Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to primarily serve the needs of customers within the City.
c.
The maximum permitted total height of a new Tower shall be one hundred ten feet (110′) above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 110′ maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
d.
Notwithstanding the one hundred ten feet (110′) maximum permitted height, Telecommunications Towers and Facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed essentially within the City, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
e.
Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.
f.
