Filing of lien for costs of abatement. A lien for the full amount of the costs of nuisance abatement shall be a filed against the subject real property. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees, all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. The county marshal shall prepare a "lien for costs of abatement" detailing any and all such costs, and attach thereto a certified copy of the order requiring nuisance abatement for the subject dwelling, building, structure or property. The clerk of the superior court shall duly record the certified copy of the order of nuisance abatement in the deed records of Barrow County and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. The lien shall attach to the property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county, and the lien shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice as required by subsection 22-147(c). The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the dwelling, building, structure or property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. The county marshal also shall forward a copy of the order of nuisance abatement and a copy of the lien for costs of abatement to the county tax commissioner.
(b)
Enforcement of lien. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien for costs of abatement. The tax commissioner shall be authorized to bill the amount of the lien separately or in conjunction with the annual ad valorem tax bill for the subject property. The tax commissioner shall have the full authority to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Tit. 48, Ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of code section 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The Barrow County Tax Commissioner shall remit any monies collected from liens for costs for abatement to the general fund of Barrow County. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(c)
Waiver and release of liens. The board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on dwelling, building, structure or property upon the owner of such dwelling, building, structure or property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the dwelling, building, structure or property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

Sec. 22-150. - Appellate procedure.
If the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, appellate review of the magistrate court's order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, structure or property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
