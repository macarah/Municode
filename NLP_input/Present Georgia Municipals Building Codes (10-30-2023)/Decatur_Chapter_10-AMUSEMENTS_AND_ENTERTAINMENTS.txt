ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-51. - Findings of fact.
Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; and DeKalb County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the city commission that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Furthermore, the public health, safety and welfare require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations, operations and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
(Ord. No. O-94-13, § 16-51, 9-19-94)
Sec. 10-52. - Purpose of article.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses; the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city; on its citizens and property; and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business establishment or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the circumstances may justify.

The city commissioners shall hear the evidence upon the charges and specifications, as filed against the licensee, and shall not consider any additional evidence beyond the scope of the charges, and may exclude evidence which is purely cumulative.
(3)
The order of proof shall be as follows: The city representative shall present his evidence in support of the charges, and the licensee shall then present his evidence. Evidence of each party may be supported by submission of pertinent documents. Each party shall be allowed to present pertinent rebuttal evidence.

The licensee and the city may be represented by counsel, and may present, examine and cross examine witnesses. Additionally, the city commissioners may interrogate all parties and witnesses to obtain necessary information.

If any such license or permit has previously been granted under the above circumstances, such circumstances shall constitute cause for the revocation of the license.
