Prior to conducting an event, a special events business licensee must notify the county manager or his designee in writing of the event.

Failure to have listed the specific planned event on the application does not preclude the county manager or his designee from determining that the planned event is of a same or similar character to those listed on the application. If the county manager or his designee determines that the event is of a same or similar character to those listed on the application, he will authorize the event. If the county manager or his designee determines that the event is not of a same or similar character to those listed on the application, he will deny the licensee the authority to conduct the event. If the county manager or his designee is unable to make a determination, he will refer the matter to the board of commissioners, who will review the matter and make a decision at the first regular meeting following referral of the matter to them.
