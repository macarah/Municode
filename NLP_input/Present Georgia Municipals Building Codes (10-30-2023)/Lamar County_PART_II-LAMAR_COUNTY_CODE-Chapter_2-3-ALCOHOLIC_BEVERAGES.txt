(b)
The board of commissioners of Lamar County takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration which are brought about by alcohol and live nudity. It is the finding of the board that prohibiting public nudity (either partial or total) under circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is in the best interest of the public welfare by furthering legitimate governmental interest, such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and allow and/or encourage nudity, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. Therefore, the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in adult entertainment establishments.
