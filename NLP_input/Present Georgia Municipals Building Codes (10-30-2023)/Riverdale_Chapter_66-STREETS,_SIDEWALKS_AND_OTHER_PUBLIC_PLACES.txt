ARTICLE IV. - SPEED HUMPS

Sec. 66-64. - Purpose.
In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems in residential neighborhoods, the city department of public works (the "department") has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other similarly situated communities and how effectively and successfully those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed humps was found to be a popular and relatively cost effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed humps were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimenting and testing, including testing on city streets, the use of speed humps has been widely endorsed by transportation authorities. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). As a result of these preliminary efforts, the following procedures have been established for groups of citizens in the city who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-65. - Criteria for installation.
The city will consider the installation of speed humps only on streets classified by the department as local residential streets. Traffic studies conducted by the department must find that a speeding problem exists based on a standard 85th percentile of at least 11 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-66. - Request for study; public hearing.
An authorized officer of an organized homeowners' association or the majority of homeowners within a neighborhood may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a neighborhood be studied for the speed hump installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners in that neighborhood are represented. The results of the neighborhood traffic speed study may be directed to the neighborhood representative by certified mail or, upon request, will be presented by the department to a neighborhood at a public hearing organized, arranged, and publicized by the neighborhood group along with a general presentation on speed humps. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group of the time and place of the public hearing.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-67. - Petition for installation—Preparation.
A formal petition in such form prescribed by the department shall be filed with the department requesting the installation of speed humps within the neighborhood. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his or her preference for the installation of neighborhood speed humps by marking a "YES" or "NO" on the petition. If more than one person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the department. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-68. - Number of signatures required; filing.
At least 75 percent of the property owners in a neighborhood must indicate an affirmative preference for speed humps before a petition will be considered by the department for recommendation to the city council.
The percentages shall be calculated by dividing the total number of property owners by the total number of property owners indicating an affirmative preference. For purposes of determining the number of property owners in the neighborhood, the geographical boundaries of the neighborhood shall be established by the department using the database of the city's taxing authorities. In the event a neighborhood is not completely built out, a minimum of 30 percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered. The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the neighborhood group, it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the department where it will be checked against property tax records to insure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented at the next regular city council business meeting for approval or disapproval by the council.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-69. - Construction; warnings posted.
(a)
The geometric design of speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speeds. Based on extensive research, speed humps shall be constructed with the following specifications: Four inches maximum vertical rise, 22 feet in horizontal length, and six foot incline-ten foot flattop-six foot decline.
(b)
Each individual speed hump location shall require posting of standard warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the city-owned rights-of-way as well as pavement markings as outlined in section 3B.26 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as approved by the Federal Highway Administration.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-70. - Procedure for removal.
The city shall remove speed humps under the following conditions:
(1)
A formal petition in the form as prescribed in section 66-67 above shall be filed with the department indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed humps;
(2)
The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds within the neighborhood may increase after the speed humps are removed;
(3)
The speed humps shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition; and
(4)
All costs associated with the initial installation and the removal of the speed humps, as determined and itemized by the department, shall have been paid.
In the event a neighborhood is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition or the removal of speed humps will be considered.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-71. - Charges for installation, maintenance, and removal; length of time for installation.
All property owners in a petitioning neighborhood shall pay for the installation and maintenance of the speed humps. The charge associated with the initial installation, maintenance, and repair of speed humps shall be a minimum of $24.00 per property, per year. The charge associated with the removal of speed humps shall be at a level that adequately covers the cost of removal as determined by the department. All rates may be subject to change to reflect material and labor increases to the city and will be posted with the schedule of fees as adopted by the mayor and council. The installation of the speed humps shall be completed, weather permitting, in approximately four months or less from the date the petition is approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
Sec. 66-72. - Collection; enforcement as a lien.
The charges for installation, maintenance, and removal of speed humps shall be in the form of an assessment against the property and shall be itemized as a separate entry, and added annually to each property owner's property tax statement. The assessment shall constitute a lien upon the property and have the same priority as an ad valorem tax lien.
(Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02)
