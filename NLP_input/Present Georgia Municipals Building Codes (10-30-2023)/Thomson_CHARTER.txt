The council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work or improvement, unless the appropriations for such projects are included in the capital improvements budget, except to meet a public emergency threatening the lives, health or property of inhabitants, when passed by four-fifths vote of the membership of the council.

Any personal property which the mayor and council may deem to be obsolete, surplus, or unusable and having a fair market value not exceeding $500.00 as determined by the council, may be sold and conveyed by the mayor and council at any time without any advertisement, or with such advertisement as they may deem necessary. Any personal property having a fair market value exceeding $500.00 shall be advertised in order to be sold and shall be advertised and sold in the same way and manner as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the sale of real property. Personal property traded in on property of a like kind need not be advertised in order to be traded.
(b)
Any real property which the mayor and council may deem to be of no use to the city may be sold at public outcry before the courthouse door in McDuffie County between the legal hours of sale to the highest bidder, under such terms as the mayor and council may feel to be proper, after advertisement in the "McDuffie Progress" for not less than two weeks nor more than four weeks, immediately preceding the date fixed for the sale, in the discretion of the mayor and council. After such sale the mayor and council shall have one hour within which to reject the high bid, and declare the sale to be void and of no effect, if they deem said bid to be insufficient to cover the value of said real property.
(c)
The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any real property which has been or may be hereafter given or conveyed to the City of Thomson by the State of Georgia or any of its agencies. As to any property which has been or may be conveyed to the City of Thomson by the State of Georgia or any of its agencies, the mayor and council shall have the right and authority to cede, grant, sell, convey or give such property to any agency of the state, federal or county governments if such real property, in the discretion of the mayor and council, is of no use to the city, and the city stands to benefit by any such conveyance.

Section 4.09. - Publication of financial statement.
As soon as practicable after the close of the fiscal year, but within six months after the close thereof, the mayor and council shall cause to be published in a local newspaper, a statement of financial condition which shall contain a statement of revenues and expenditures showing all municipal accounts as of the close of the preceding fiscal year. Such statement of financial condition shall be prepared so as to fairly represent the general financial condition of the city as of the close of the preceding fiscal year.
Section 4.10. - Property taxes.
All property subject to taxation for state or county purposes, assessed as of January 1, in each year, shall be returned for taxes each year on or before April 1. If such return is not made, the mayor and council are authorized to assess a penalty of not more than ten percent (10%) of the taxes due on said property. Taxes shall become past due or delinquent if not paid on or before December 20th, of each year. The council may provide by ordinance for an independent city assessment as provided by law or may elect to use the county assessment for the year in which city taxes are to be levied as provided by Georgia Law. If an independent city assessment is made, a board of equalization, consisting of three freeholders of the city appointed by the mayor and council, with compensation fixed by ordinance, shall hear appeals of taxpayers taken within ten days after the city clerk has sent a notice, by ordinary mail, of a new or increased assessment; provided that such notice shall not be required, nor may appeals be taken, in the case of initial city assessments that are the same as county assessments. Except as otherwise provided in this section, appeals involving city property assessments may be taken as now or as may hereafter be provided by general law.
Section 4.11. - Tax levy.
The council shall be authorized to levy an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the city for the purpose of raising revenues to defray the costs of operating the city government, providing governmental services, and for any other public purposes as determined by the council in its discretion. The council is also authorized to provide for sufficient levy to pay principal and interest on general obligations. Said city is hereby authorized to levy taxes in excess of the limits prescribed by Georgia Code Sections 92-4101 through 92-4104 [now repealed] and the City of Thomson is hereby exempted from the provisions of Georgia Code sections 92-4101 through 92-4104 [now repealed], inclusive.
Section 4.12. - Tax due date and tax bills.
The city shall send tax bills to taxpayers, showing the assessed valuations, amount of taxes due, tax due dates and information as to delinquency dates and penalties. Failure to send tax bills shall not, however, invalidate any tax. Property taxes shall become delinquent if not paid on or before December 20 of each year, which time may be changed by ordinance, at which time a penalty of ten percent (10%) in addition to a fi. fa. charge may be added, and thereafter such taxes shall be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum, from the due date until paid. On and after the date when such taxes become delinquent, the tax records of the city shall have the force and effect of a judgment of a court of record. Said city shall have the right, power and authority to provide by ordinance for the return of all real and personal property for taxation and to provide for the compelling of such return; and to provide penalties for failure to do so, after due notice and hearing to be prescribed by the mayor and council, for the current or any previous year, not in any conflict with any limitation prescribed by the laws of Georgia; and to prescribe the time or times when said taxes shall be due and payable.
Editor's noteâ€” With respect to state law concerning the rate of interest on past due taxes see O.C.G.A. Â§ 48-2-40 which establishes a rate of one percent per month for delinquent taxes.
Section 4.13. - Collection of delinquent taxes.
The mayor and council may provide by ordinance for the collection of delinquent taxes by fi. fa. issued by the city clerk and executed by the chief of police under the same procedure provided by laws governing execution of such process from the superior court, or by the use of any other available legal processes and remedies.

Section 4.14. - Transfer of executions.
The clerk of the City of Thomson shall be authorized to transfer and assign any fi. fa. or execution issued for street, sewer, or any other assessment in the same manner, upon the same terms, and to the same effect, and thereby vest the purchaser or transferee, with the same rights as in cases of sales or transfers of tax fi. fas. as now provided by law; and in all sales of property hereafter made under execution in behalf of the city for the collection of street, sewer and other assessments, the owner or owners, as the case may be, are authorized to redeem same within the same time and on compliance with the same terms and payment of the same premium, interest and cost, as in cases of redemption of property where sold under state or county ad valorem tax fi. fa. as the same now exists, or as may from time to time be provided by law.
Section 4.15. - Special assessments.
The council may assess all or part of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, widening, or improving any public way, street, sidewalk, curbing, gutters, sewers or other utility mains and appurtenances, against the abutting property owners, under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by ordinance. Such special assessments shall become delinquent thirty days after their due dates, and may thereupon be subject, in addition to fi. fa. charges, to a penalty of ten percent (10%) and shall thereafter be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum from due date until paid. A lien for such amount plus fi. fa. charges, interest and penalties, shall exist against the abutting property superior to all other liens, except that it shall be of equal dignity with liens for county and city property taxes, and said lien shall be enforceable by the same procedures and under the same remedies as provided in this article for city property taxes.
