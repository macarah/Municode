ARTICLE III. - DISTRICT REGULATIONS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 102-221. - Establishment of districts.
In order to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter, the city is hereby divided into the following districts:
EXPAND
RD Rural Development District
R1 Single-Family Residential District
R2 Single-Family Patio Homes District
R3 Multifamily Residential/Townhomes District
CR Commercial-Residential District
GC General Commercial District
GI General Industry District
  (1)
Rural development district (RD). This district is intended to permit a combination of low density residential uses of various types, limited agricultural activities and associated uses. The regulations of the district are designed primarily to encourage a compatible relationship between agriculture and low density, single-family rural residential development.
(2)
Single-family residential district (R1). The purpose of this district is to accommodate medium density single-family residences. Single-family dwellings are restricted to meeting Type I appearance standards. It is the intent of this chapter to maintain existing neighborhoods at their current standard in regard to road frontage, side yards and setbacks. New development will come under the standard set forth in this chapter.
(3)
Single-family patio homes district (R2). The purpose of this district is to provide high density single-family residences. Single-family dwellings shall meet Type I or Type II appearance standards.
(4)
Multifamily residential/townhomes district (R3). The R3 residential district is established as a relatively high-density residential neighborhood in which the principal use of the land is for single-family, two-family and multifamily residences. The regulations for this district are intended to provide space for those persons desiring small residences and apartments and to discourage unwarranted encroachment of commercial, industrial or other uses capable of adversely affecting the residential character of the district.
(5)
Commercial-residential district (CR). This district is designed to provide a high quality environment for limited retail activities, offices for professional services and residential uses as part of the commercial structures.
(6)
General commercial district (GC). The purpose of this district is to provide appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial activities which will serve a large market area. This district will generally be located along the major arterial highways or where these highways meet. Emphasis is on creating commercial nodes rather than strip developments.
(7)
General industry district (GI). The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for warehousing, distribution, manufacturing and other intensive activities of an industrial nature.

DIVISION 7. - MANUFACTURED HOMES, MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARKS

Sec. 102-401. - Purpose.
The purpose of the division is to provide standards and regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. The city recognizes that manufactured housing meets the needs of many county residents for affordable housing and is compatible with site-built housing if developed in accordance with comparable standards. The regulations in this division shall govern the use and operation of all manufactured homes on single lots or within parks used for permanent residential occupancy, as well as recreational vehicle parks used for temporary occupancy, in the city. It is the intent of these regulations to empower the city planning commission, the county health department, and the city manager or his designee to review the development of manufactured home sites, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle parks within the city for the purposes stated in this division.
(Ord. of 7-7-2003, § 13.1)
Sec. 102-402. - Standards for manufactured homes; nonconforming manufactured home parks.
(a)
Nonconforming manufactured home parks. Nonconforming mobile/manufactured home parks lawfully existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived may be continued, but if such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 90 days, the manufactured home park shall be made to conform with the requirements of this division prior to its being occupied again. Any expansion or addition to an existing manufactured home park shall be in compliance with this division.
(b)
Annual report of location; location decal. Every person holding title to or possession of a manufactured home which is placed or located within the limits of the city shall report the location of, and obtain a location decal for, the manufactured home from the county tax commissioner annually, no later than April 1 of each year. Such location decal shall be designed in such manner and affixed to the manufactured home in such manner as to cause it to be easily visible for inspection.
(c)
Occupancy permit. Any owner of a manufactured home, whether locating or relocating the manufactured home, shall obtain a permit from the city indicating compliance with all applicable codes before any person is authorized to occupy any newly installed manufactured home.
(d)
Conditions for moving manufactured home into or within city. A manufactured home permit to move a manufactured home into or within the city will not be issued until the following conditions have been met in accordance with established administrative procedures:
(1)
A valid location decal must be issued from the tax commissioner's office and attached to the manufactured home.
(2)
All manufactured homes located in the city shall be model year 1985 or later.
(3)
All manufactured homes must be located at an approved manufactured home space, or in an approved manufactured home park subject to the requirements of this division.
(4)
For individual lots not approved under the manufactured home park regulations, a sanitary permit must be obtained from the county health department for on-site sewage disposal, or, if sewer service will be provided, a letter shall be provided by the local government providing the service verifying it will allow public sewer hookup.
(5)
All manufactured homes located on individual lots will adhere to the appearance standards set forth in division 2 of this article. The type of appearance standard required will depend on the zoning district where the manufactured home is located.
(e)
Building permit. A building permit shall be required to locate a manufactured home in the city except under the following condition: Manufactured homes may be brought in the county and located on a sales lot of a state-approved dealer as listed in the office of the state safety commissioner for sale without a building or sanitary permit. However, under no exceptions shall any manufactured home, which is located on a sales lot, be occupied unless all permit requirements in this division are met. Installation must comply with the Rules and Regulations for Manufactured Homes, chapter 120-3-7, appendix A, made and promulgated by the state safety fire commissioner pursuant to authority set forth in state law.
(f)
Temporary electrical power. The city, after inspection, is authorized to permit the applicable power company to provide temporary power not to exceed 120 volts for the express purpose of completing necessary construction and installation of the manufactured home. This provision specifically does not authorize permanent power hookup or occupancy of the manufactured home. It shall be unlawful for temporary power to be utilized on a permanent basis or for occupancy of such home.
(g)
Minimum construction standards. Each newly installed manufactured home in the city shall conform to the minimum construction standards required by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as required by the National Mobile Home and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 USC 5401 et seq., before that manufactured home is entitled to receive any utility service to the manufactured home. It is the intent of this subsection to prohibit moving manufactured homes into the city that do not conform to the applicable Department of Housing and Urban Development construction standards, as expressed in 42 USC 5401 et seq., and regulations established pursuant to that act. To that end, no manufactured home shall be allowed to locate or relocate for permanent or temporary occupancy in the city unless that manufactured home complies with the minimum construction standards required by HUD, which compliance must be evidenced by the affixation of a permanent label or tag certifying the compliance. Manufactured homes which do not display certification compliance shall not be eligible for a city building and/or occupancy permit. Any manufactured home in the city which legally exists at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived that does display certification compliance shall not be required to have certification. However, any manufactured home which does not display certification shall be considered a nonconforming structure and shall not be relocated to any other site within the city.
(h)
Installation requirements. All newly installed manufactured homes shall be permanently connected to water, sewage and electrical service in compliance with applicable health codes and chapter 120-3-7, Rules and Regulations for Manufactured Homes, plus appendix A of that document, made and promulgated by the state safety fire commissioner.

All manufactured homes shall be installed to meet the manufacturer's regulations. At the time of inspection, the space beneath each manufactured home shall be enclosed, with the exception of ventilation and access openings, and according to the appearance standards in division 2 of this article, it must be in compliance with type I, type II or type III. The residential zone of each manufactured home will dictate which type it must meet (see division 2 of this article). At the time of request for a building permit, the number of ventilation openings shall be set by code enforcement. The standards are more specifically explained in the Rules and Regulations for Manufactured Homes. The enclosing materials shall extend from the lower edge of the exterior walls of the manufactured home to the ground surface level of the pad on which it is located. All ventilation and access openings shall be covered with wire mesh screen or its equivalent.

DIVISION 8. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 102-431. - Purpose and intent.
The purposes and intent of planned unit development (PUD) districts are to allow and encourage unique, flexible, creative and imaginative arrangements and mixes of land uses in site planning and development than are permitted through conventional land use requirements.
(1)
Encourage a broader mix of residential housing types, including detached and attached dwellings, than would normally be constructed in conventional subdivisions.
(2)
Allow and encourage the development of tracts of land as single developments that are planned neighborhoods, including civic and semi-public uses (e.g. playgrounds, meeting halls, etc.) that contribute to the livability of a neighborhood.
(3)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas and open spaces within developments.
(4)
Provide for the more efficient use of land through clustering and other flexible, innovative development arrangements that will result in small networks of utilities and streets and thereby lower development and housing costs.
(5)
Provide a more desirable living environment than would be possible through the strict application of conventional requirements to promote pedestrian and non-vehicular interconnectivity, mixed use, and sustainable planning principles.
(6)
Provide for higher gross and net development densities and intensities as an inducement to development in a manner consistent with the purposes of this division.
(7)
Ensure that the designs of building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious.
