ARTICLE XIII. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 104-532. - Introduction.
(a)
It is hereby determined that discharges to the county's municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(b)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and illegal connections to the county's MS4 from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(c)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(d)
These impacts of non-stormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(e)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county's MS4.
(f)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits that require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the county's MS4.
(g)
Therefore, the county adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county's MS4. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county's MS4 is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
