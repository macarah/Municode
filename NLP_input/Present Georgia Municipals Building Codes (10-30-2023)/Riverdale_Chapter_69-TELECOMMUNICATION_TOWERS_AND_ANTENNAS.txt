Chapter 69 - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 69-1. - Purpose, findings and goals.
(a)
The purpose of this chapter is to balance the interests of residents, visitors and business owners of the city with the competing interests of providers of telecommunication services. This chapter establishes guidelines for the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas and the facilities to which such towers and antennas are affixed so as to promote the health, safety, order, prosperity and general welfare of the city within the framework imposed by Telecommunications Act of 1996.
(b)
The mayor and council for the city expressly take legislative notice of the deleterious impact of towers and antennas on the aesthetic and monetary value of properties, and in particular residential and scenic properties, from which such towers and antennas are visible. The goals of this chapter, therefore, are to:
(1)
Ensure, to the extent practicable, that new antennas are affixed to towers, buildings and other suitable structures already in existence and that construction of additional towers and alternative tower structures be considered only as a last resort;
(2)
Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(3)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites (co-location);
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(5)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to construct them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers or antennas;
(6)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from structural failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures;
(7)
Minimize danger to children and others who might attempt to climb or play on antennas, monopoles or towers;
(8)
Develop an inventory of existing sites and telecommunication facilities with specific information regarding ownership, licenses, users, structural capacity, transmission and reception capacity, contract conditions affecting co-location, and undeveloped land area; and
(9)
Provide for the disposition of towers not in use.

Sec. 69-2. - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them:
Alternative tower structure means any structure that functions as a tower as defined herein that is designed so as to camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas and other communication equipment, such as man-made trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative designs.
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
Co-location means the placement of the antennas of two or more service providers upon a single tower or alternative tower structure.
Community development director means the community development director for the City of Riverdale, Georgia.
FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.
Guy tower means a tower that is supported, in whole or in part, by guy wires and/or ground anchors.
Height, when referring to a tower, antenna or other structure, means the distance measured vertically from the highest point when positioned for operation to the lowest point, which is defined as the average ground elevation along the structure being measured at either roof or ground level, whichever is applicable. The height of a tower shall include the height of any antenna positioned for operation attached or which may be attached to the highest point on the tower.
Lattice or self-supporting tower means a tower that has open-framed supports on three or four sides and is constructed without guy wires and ground anchors.
Monopole tower means a telecommunication tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
Preexisting, when used to modify antenna, monopole or tower, means any such structure for which a city building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter.
Telecommunication facility means a telecommunication tower, a monopole tower, an antenna or any and all buildings, structures or other supporting equipment used in connection with a telecommunication tower, a monopole tower, an antenna or used in connection or associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies.
Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for the telecommunications services, including radio, transmission, reception or relay of television, microwave, common-carrier, cellular telephone, personal wireless communications, wireless cable television and other communications signals of a similar nature. The term includes self-supporting lattice towers, monopole towers, guy towers and alternative tower structures.
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07)
Sec. 69-3. - Applicability.
The requirements set forth in this chapter shall govern antennas, monopoles, towers, support structures and other equipment used in connection or associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies ("telecommunication facilities") which exceed the height limitations specified for structures in each zoning district. The height limitations specified for each zoning district shall not apply to antennas, monopoles, towers or other equipment associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies.
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07)
ARTICLE II. - PREFERRED AND DISFAVORED LOCATIONS

Sec. 69-4. - Installation on existing towers or monopoles (co-location preferred).
(a)
No new telecommunication tower or structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An existing tower or structure will be presumed to "accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna" as required above if such tower or structure is currently being used for transmitting and/or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that the location of the tower or structure meets the design and siting requirements of this chapter.
(b)
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
(1)
No existing tower or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
(2)
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
(5)
The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable;
(6)
Property owner or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to reasonably accommodate the applicant's needs; or
(7)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(c)
Antennas may be installed on existing towers of any height so long as the addition adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing tower, subject to all applicable zoning district restrictions, the provisions contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable restrictions, codes and ordinances.
(d)
If it is adequately demonstrated that antenna co-location, as required in this chapter, is not possible for a given geographic area, the following use may be permitted after the city reviews the evidence:
(1)
Constructing a new tower, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with such tower or antenna within a geographical business district previously designated, authorized and approved by the city to specifically serve as an alternative district for the location of new towers in the event co-locations are not possible, if any such districts have been so designated. Provided, however, that all structures shall meet the setback, screening, buffer, height, size and other requirements contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable, restrictions, codes and ordinances; or
(2)
Installation of an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other free-standing nonresidential structure) that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as the additional antenna height adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure, subject to all applicable zoning district restrictions, the provisions contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable restrictions, codes and ordinances.
(e)
At no time will any co-location site be allowed to become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the zoning commission to be visually obtrusive.
(f)
Co-location tower specifications. The location of any tower that a qualified professional engineer certifies can accommodate the ultimate number of shared users proposed by the applicant, and that the city concludes is in conformity with all other requirements, must meet the following height and usage criteria:
(1)
For a single user, up to 70 feet in height;
(2)
For two users, up to 100 feet in height; and
(3)
For three or more users, up to 130 feet in height.
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07)
Sec. 69-5. - Other preferred location sites.
(a)
Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for other smaller telecommunications facilities. Therefore, antennae should be less noticeable when affixed to publicly used structures, such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles and schools, than when placed on commercial or residential structures.
(b)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures, located in zoning districts permitting telecommunication facilities, such as warehouse factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(c)
Alternative structures. Installation on existing alternative structures such as electric transmission towers or billboards, or construction of alternative structures appropriate to the proposed location context such as bell towers, church steeples or flagpoles.
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07)
Sec. 69-6. - Disfavored location sites.
Any residentially zoned property, residentially occupied structure, sites within four tower lengths of a residentially zoned property and any site having a negative visual impact on historically significant structures or designated scenic views shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07)

A CUP may be issued to erect, repair, construct, relocate or maintain a monopole tower within the city, provided that:
(1)
The monopole tower is not greater than 150 feet in height (the council may allow up to 30 feet in additional height for each co-location opportunity made available on each tower, up the maximum height allowed by the council for each particular location, according to the circumstances thereof);
(2)
The monopole tower is made of wood or, if made of steel, the monopole maintains a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, is painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness;
(3)
The monopole tower displays no advertising;
(4)
The monopole tower is not artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other governmental authority for safety purposes. Where required, the city shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views;
(5)
The monopole tower meets or exceeds current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other governmental agency with the authority to regulate telecommunication facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owner of the monopole shall bring such monopole into compliance with any revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the city to require removal or re-permitting of the antenna at the owner's expense;
(6)
The applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing telecommunication facility can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna;
(7)
The monopole tower meets the following setbacks and separation requirements:
a.
Monopole towers are set back from any adjoining residentially zoned property a distance of 200 feet;
b.
Monopole towers have a front yard setback of 60 feet, and sufficient rear and side yard setbacks to fully contain the structure in the event of monopole failure; and
c.
Monopole towers over 40 feet in height are located no less than one-quarter mile from any existing telecommunication tower or monopole that is over 50 feet in height;
(8)
The monopole tower is equipped with an anti-climbing device to prevent unauthorized access;
(9)
The monopole tower complies with all current safety, design, structural and wind loading standards of applicable building and technical codes adopted by the City, so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents; and
(10)
Accessory or principal uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a monopole shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a monopole shall not be stored or parked on the site of the monopole, unless repairs to the monopole are being made;
b.
Monopoles may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, set back, separation and general requirements of this chapter are met, monopoles may occupy a leased parcel on a site meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. When joint use of a lot is permitted, the city shall require the execution of a unity of title if two or more lots are utilized for set back purposes or to prohibit the unlawful division of a lot containing a monopole and another principal use. The minimum distance between a monopole and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 60 feet or the 100 percent breakpoint of the monopole. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
