Chapter 110 - SIGNS[1]
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 110-1. - Purposes.
The purposes of the chapter are set out in the preamble hereto and as follows herein.
(1)
A comprehensive regulation of signs is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth throughout Lamar County and within and adjacent to the City of Milner and this growth attracts signs that are unrelated to business uses inside the city, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values.
(2)
To ensure that the city remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
(3)
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners, to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city.
(4)
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council hereby imposes the regulations contained in this article.
(5)
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. By enacting this section, the city council intends to:
a.
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
b.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city;
c.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
d.
Maintain the historical image of the city;
e.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
f.
Promote economic development; and
g.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

Sec. 110-32. - Nonconforming signs.
Invariably, at the time this chapter is adopted or amended, certain signs, which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment, will not conform to specified regulations and development. These are known as nonconforming signs, and in order to feasibly adopt this chapter and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming signs, these signs are allowed to continue under the following special conditions:
(1)
Where a nonconforming sign has ceased to be used for more than six months or has been changed to a permanent or conforming sign, further use of the sign must be in conformance with the standards and requirements of this chapter.
(2)
A nonconforming sign must not be extended or altered unless the extension or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of the chapter.
(3)
A nonconforming sign which is altered or extended must meet applicable city building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a sign permit for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming sign, the administrative officer will inspect the sign and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the sign into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the sign meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he will issue the sign permit for the nonconforming sign.
(4)
If a nonconforming sign suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its assessed valuation, the sign may be reconstructed and reused as before if done within 12 months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater than 50 percent of its assessed valuation, such a sign may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and requirements of this chapter.

A photograph or line drawing of the sign, depicting precisely what is to be portrayed on the sign.
(4)
Any other documentation which the administrative officer may specify.
(e)
No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of this chapter.

(1)
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.

(g)
An existing sign which is altered or extended must meet applicable city building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a sign permit for the extension or alteration of an existing sign, the administrative officer will inspect the sign and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the sign into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations before a sign permit may be issued.
(h)
The administrative officer is in charge of issuing sign permits. The administrative officer will contact the applicant at the address shown on the application. The sign permit will be issued if, upon review of the application and inspection of the site, the administrative officer is satisfied that the proposed sign will meet the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable ordinances. The administrative officer may require the submission of additional materials if he feels additional information is needed in order to determine if the proposed sign meets the requirements of this chapter.
(i)
If the administrative officer feels that the proposed sign as presented in the sign permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this chapter, he will not issue a sign permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with this chapter and be eligible for a sign permit.
(j)
Construction on an approved sign must start within six months from the date of issue of the sign permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the sign is desired at a future date. If construction is begun on an approved sign and then ceases before the sign is completed, construction must be restarted within six months from the time it was stopped or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the sign is desired to resume at a future date. Records of sign permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the administrative officer.

(a)
A certificate of final sign approval is required before a sign for which a sign permit has been issued may be used or maintained. The sign permit becomes the certificate of final sign approval when the administrative officer signs it in the appropriate space, certifying that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this chapter have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of final approval to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this chapter.
(b)
The administrative officer will issue the certificate of final sign approval within ten days of receiving notification from the applicant that construction of the sign has been completed if he finds that all requirements of this chapter and all other applicable ordinances have been met. However, if he finds that all requirements of such ordinances and this chapter have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of final sign approval, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of final approval. He will notify the owner/contractor within ten days, stating the reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the chapter and be eligible for a certificate of final approval. After the sign is constructed and in place, the applicant must notify the administrative officer within two working days that the sign is ready for final inspection.

When an action of the administrative officer is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appeal action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then the administrative officer may certify to the mayor and council that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appeal action would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appeal action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the mayor and council or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(d)
When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer is received, the mayor and council will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal.

Sec. 110-36. - Variances.
(a)
A variance is a permit, issued by the mayor and council, which allows use of a sign in a way that does not meet certain requirements of this chapter. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where extreme hardship would result if all the requirements of this chapter were applied stringently to a particular sign. The hardship must be proven by showing beyond a doubt that reasonable use of this sign is not possible if all of the requirements of this chapter are to be met. The hardship cannot be self created such as:
(1)
A sign purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction.
(2)
A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales of this sign.
(3)
An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance.
(b)
Relief from the hardship, the variance, must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose of this chapter.

When a variance is issued, the spirit of this chapter must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted signs in the zoning district in which the sign or proposed sign in question is located.

(d)
The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject sign or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature.

Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the mayor and council for their consideration. No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of this chapter. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the mayor and council is, at the time of such an application determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of this chapter, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:

(g)
When an application for a variance is received, the mayor and council will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days before the hearing. Such a notice will state the application number, owner's name, sign location, its area, time, place, and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days prior to the public hearing, a notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the applicant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file for a permanent record.
(h)
The mayor and council will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
(i)
The variance issued by the mayor and council must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from.
(j)
The mayor and council may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a sign permit, the sign permit must be obtained and construction begun within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months.
(k)
The decision of the mayor and council on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the county superior court.
