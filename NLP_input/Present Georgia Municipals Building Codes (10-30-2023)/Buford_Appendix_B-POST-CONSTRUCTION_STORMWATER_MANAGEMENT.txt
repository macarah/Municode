Additional details can be found in the GSMM.
(d)
Stormwater Runoff Quality/Reduction. Stormwater Runoff Quality and Reduction shall be provided by using the following:
(i)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before January 5, 2021, the applicant may choose either [(d)(ii)](A) Runoff Reduction or [(d)(ii)](B) Water Quality.
(ii)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after January 5, 2021, the applicant shall choose [(d)(ii)](A) Runoff Reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent [(d)(ii)](A) Runoff Reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the Practicability Policy, then [(d)(ii)](B) Water Quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80% of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
(A)
Runoff Reduction: The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
(B)
Water Quality: The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80% of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event.
(iii)
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in Section 9.10.5, the City of Buford may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
