ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 14-1. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Nuisance means anything which causes hurt, inconvenience or damage to another, provided that the hurt, inconvenience or damage complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but rather such as would affect an ordinary reasonable person. The fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance.
Nuisance per se means an act, occupation or structure which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings.
Private nuisance means a nuisance limited in its injurious effects to one or a few individuals.
Public nuisance means a nuisance which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals.

Such notice shall be served at least two days prior to the date set for the hearing, by any police officer of the city, and shall be made either personally or by leaving a copy at the party's usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein.
