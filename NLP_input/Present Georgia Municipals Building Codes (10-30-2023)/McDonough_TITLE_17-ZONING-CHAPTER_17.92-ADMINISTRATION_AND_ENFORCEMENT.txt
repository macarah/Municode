Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful civil, criminal, quasi-civil or quasi-criminal action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

If any building or structure is constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this Title, the Mayor and Council, the building inspector, the Director or any adjacent property owner who would be damaged by such violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute an injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action in proceeding to stop the violation in the case of such building, structure or land use.
