a.
Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
b.
Advise the permittee when additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permits are known to be required, that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit.
c.
Notify adjacent communities and the state department of natural resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
d.
Any provision of this section, or any other ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, no person shall be relieved of his duty to comply with this section or any other ordinance, law or regulation whether or not such person has been advised by the planning and development director or his/her designee or other city employees; the city shall not be estopped by errors of its employees from enforcing any of its ordinances and does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of its employees' advice as to compliance with laws, especially federal and state laws.

The planning and development director or his/her designee shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter which apply to developed and occupied areas and to property in an undeveloped state affecting city responsibility for maintenance of the storm drainage system. The planning and development director or his/her designee shall assure that maintenance is provided in perpetuity by the responsible owner/developer within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourses so that flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

(Code 1977, § 35A-109(c))
Sec. 26-39. - Inspection and right-of-entry.
Upon presentation of planning and development director or his/her designee identification to the developer, contractor, owner, owner's agent, operator or occupants, employees of the planning and development department may enter, during all reasonable hours, any property under proposed or existing development and construction. Such employees of the planning and development department may make inspections of the facilities for the purpose of determining plan requirements or compliance with ordinance provisions. The planning and development director or his/her designee may inspect any drainage system within or outside of an existing drainage easement. All drainage facilities located on private property, whether dedicated to the city or not, shall be accessible at all times for city inspection. When drainage facilities are accepted by the city for maintenance, public access easements shall be provided. Reasonable access shall be provided to all drainage easements for inspection and maintenance functions. When an easement does not exist for the drainage system, the permission of the owner shall be obtained before entrance; however, if emergency maintenance is required, permission of the owner shall not be mandatory before entrance.
In the event the owner objects to the inspection of the planning director, the planning director shall make or cause to be made inspections to determine the conditions of all structures and premises to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare under the provisions of this chapter. If the planning director develops probable cause that the property maintenance code has been violated, the planning director or a designee of the planning director may obtain an administrative search warrant or other authorization from the municipal court or other court of proper jurisdiction to enter the premises and conduct the necessary and authorized search. Such search warrant shall be requested from a court upon the submission of any photographs obtained from public property or neighboring property, an affidavit supporting a reason to believe a violation exists of this property maintenance code or building or zoning code, and/or any other supporting evidence justifying the issuance of the search warrant in compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements. If an owner, tenant, or other person in control of the property voluntarily allows entry in to the property, no such warrant shall be necessary. The inspection shall be limited to areas and purposes authorized by the person in control of the premises or the administrative search warrant. The ordinance codified herein shall not be construed to require or authorize inspections where there is no cause to believe a violation exists. Abandoned structures and lots shall be subject to unrestricted, complete and thorough code inspections, including legal right of entry into those structures found unsecured.
(Code 1977, § 35A-109(d); Ord. No. 2005-05, § 1, 2-14-2005; Ord. No. 2017-13, § 1, 6-12-2017)
Sec. 26-40. - Emergency maintenance.
(a)
The planning and development director or his/her designee may conduct emergency maintenance operations on private land and on drainage systems when emergency conditions exist. Emergency maintenance shall constitute the removal of trees and other debris that, in the judgement of the planning and development director or his/her designee, create a condition potentially injurious to life, property and the public road system.
(b)
Emergency maintenance conducted on any drainage system shall not be construed as constituting a continuing maintenance obligation on the part of the city.
(Code 1977, § 35-109(e); Ord. No. 2005-05, § 1, 2-14-2005)
Sec. 26-41. - Notice of violation.
Whenever the planning and development director or his/her designee determines that activity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, or that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, he may issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be to the owner of the property or his agent and shall:
(1)
Be in writing;
(2)
Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred;
(3)
List the specific provisions of this chapter that have been violated; and
(4)
State that, if the repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the planning and development director or his/her designee, a summons shall be issued for the owner to appear in municipal court.
Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a new and separate violation. However, in the judgement of the planning and development director or his/her designee, when a violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this chapter or constitutes a public health and safety hazard, the planning and development director or his/her designee may issue a court summons in lieu of a notice of violation.
