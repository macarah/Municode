ARTICLE IV. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
DIVISION 1. - FINDINGS OF FACT AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

Sec. 14-407. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effects of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. No. 01-08, Pt. I, 5-8-01)
Sec. 14-408. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(a)
Protect, maintain and enhance human life and health;
(b)
Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(c)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(f)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
(g)
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;
(h)
Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and
(i)
Improve the stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.
(Ord. No. 01-08, Pt. I, 5-8-01; Ord. No. 08-12, Pt. I, 7-22-08)
Sec. 14-409. - Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions that:
(a)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
(b)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(d)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(e)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers, which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(f)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS

Sec. 14-410. - Specific definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.
Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall shall be considered new construction.
Adjacent to the future-conditions floodplain means those areas that are no higher in elevation than either (1) three (3) feet above the base flood elevation or (2) one (1) foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, unless the area is hydraulically independent (meaning absolutely no connection to the flooding source such as through pipes, sewer laterals, down drains, foundation drains, ground seepage, overland flow, gated or valved pipes, excavated and backfilled trenches, etc. with no fill or other manmade barriers creating the separation).
Adversely affects means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain coordinator's interpretation of any provision of this article.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard. See "Special flood hazard area."
Base flood means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this article. It is equivalent to the "intermediate regional floodplain" (IRF), previously used in the county.
Base flood elevation means the highest water surface elevation anticipated at any given point during the base flood.
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade i.e., below ground level on all sides.
Basin means a region or land area drained by a single river system.
Building. See "Structure."
County Code section 1-10 means an infraction subject to a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or thirty (30) days imprisonment in the county jail or both per violation for each day of violation.
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Director means the director of planning and development or designee.
Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
Existing construction means, for insurance rating purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before May 15, 1980, (the initial flood insurance map date).
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the instillation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before June 6, 1974.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Flood, flooding, or flood water means:
(1)
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
(2)
The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards ant he risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding."
Floodplain coordinator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (Refer to FEMA technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93).
Floodway means the channel of river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the future-conditions flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot, also referred to as "regulatory floodway."
Floodway fringe is the area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
Fraud and victimization as related to Division 6, Variances, of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the board of commissioners will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purposes unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The terms include only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and do not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
Future-conditions flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year based on future-conditions hydrology. Also known as the one-hundred-year future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions floodplain means any land susceptible to flooding by the future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The future-conditions flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the future-conditions flood.
Future-conditions hydrology means the flood discharges associated with projected land-use conditions based on a community's zoning map, comprehensive land-use plans, and/or watershed study projections, and without consideration of projected future construction of flood detention structures or projected future hydraulic modifications, within a stream or other waterway, such as a bridge or culvert construction, fill and excavation.
Governing body is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
Hardship as related to Division 6, Variances, of this article means the exceptional hardship that could result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The board of commissioners requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(1)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(4)
Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
Increased costs of compliance coverage means the National Flood Insurance Program coverage used to mitigate repetitive flood loss properties, where the cumulative flood damage over a ten-year period is such that the cost of repairing the damage is more than half of the building's fair market value.
The intermediate regional flood (IRF) means a one-hundred-year frequency flood as defined on the flood hazard map which has a probability of occurring once every one hundred (100) years or having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeding in any given year, also known as the base flood, or one-hundred-year flood.
Land development means any land change, including but not limited to, clearing, digging, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, construction, paving, and any other installation of impervious cover.

The term includes any structure commonly referred to as a "mobile home" regardless of the date of manufacture. The term also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) or land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and/or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this article.

Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:
(1)
Built on a single chassis;
(2)

Start of construction includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab for footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

The market value of the building means:
(1)
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads when the cost of such repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article.

Sec. 14-442. - Floodway encroachments.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-412 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(a)
All encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and any other new development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in [subsection] (b).
(b)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(c)
If an applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodways shall be issued by the floodplain coordinator until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision is issued by FEMA and a no-rise certification is approved by the floodplain coordinator.
(Ord. No. 08-12, Pt. I, 7-22-08)
Sec. 14-443. - Maintenance requirements.
modified
The owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 08-12, pt. I, adopted July 22, 2008, amended Div. 2 in its entir4ety and enacted similar provisions set out herein. The former Div. 2 derived from Ord. No. 01-08, pt. I, adopted May 8, 2001.

Sec. 14-444. - Nature of variance.
(a)
The variance criteria set forth in this division are based on the general principle of law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the owner or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
(b)
It is the duty of the board of commissioners to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. No. 08-12, Pt. I, 7-22-08)
Sec. 14-445. - Appeal board.
(a)
In passing upon requests for variances, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article including all of the following:
(1)
Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2)
Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3)
Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
(4)
Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5)
Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6)
Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7)
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8)
Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(9)
Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10)
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
(11)
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(b)
Any owner to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice from the zoning board of appeals that:
(1)
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and
(2)
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain coordinator in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(Ord. No. 08-12, Pt. I, 7-22-08)
Sec. 14-446. - Conditions for variances.
(a)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(b)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(c)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated or mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(d)
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(Ord. No. 08-12, Pt. I, 7-22-08)

Compliance with all other requirements of this Code;
(3)
A full explanation of the reasons for the variance; and

Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the director shall first notify the owner or other responsible person in writing of its intended action, and shall provide a reasonable opportunity of not less than ten (10) days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four (24) hours' notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the owner or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the director may take any one or more of the following actions or impose any one or more of the following penalties:
(a)
Stop-work order. The director may issue a stop-work order that shall be served on the owner or other responsible person.
