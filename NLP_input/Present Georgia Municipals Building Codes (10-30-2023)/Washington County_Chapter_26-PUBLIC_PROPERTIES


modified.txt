The applicant must move, relocate or remove any installation or construction placed on county ROW without cost to the county when instructed in writing to do so by the county. If necessary, the applicant's performance bond, escrow, or letter of credit will be used to accomplish this. When determined necessary by the county, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory evidence of adequate liability insurance to cover all aspects of the work specified under the permit for protection of the traveling public. Limits of such coverage shall be determined separately for each applicant and declared by the county at its discretion.
Sec. 26-36. - Definitions.
(a)
In the construction of this article and of all ordinances and resolutions, the rules in this section shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the county board of commissioners.
(b)
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
AASHTO means the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which publishes documents, including A Policy of Geometric Design (Green Book) and Roadway Design Guide.
Acceleration lane means a speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of enabling a vehicle entering the roadway to increase its speed to a rate at which it can more safely merge with through traffic. Also called an "accel lane."
Access means entrance to or exit from land adjacent to a public road.
Angle of two-way driveway means the angle of deflection measured from the centerline of the nearest travel lane to the centerline of the driveway. An angle of 90 degrees is desirable.
Applicant means the person or organization that has applied for a permit.
Board of commissioners means the board of commissioners of Washington County, Georgia.
Clear zone. The roadside recovery area should remain free of hazards such as steep embankments, trees, poles, etc. Studies have indicated that on high-speed highways, over 45 mph, a width of 30 feet or more from the edge of the traveled way permits about 80 percent of the vehicles leaving a roadway out of control to recover safely.
Commercial driveway means any private entrance, exit, ramp, tunnel, bridge, side road or other vehicular passageway to any property used for commercial purposes, except a farm or dwelling house not exceeding a four-family capacity.
Commissioners means the board of commissioners of Washington County, Georgia.
County means Washington County, Georgia.
Deceleration lane means a speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of enabling a vehicle that is making an exit turn from a roadway to slow to a safe turning speed after it has left the mainstream of faster-moving traffic. Also called a "decel lane"; it denotes a right turn lane or a left turn lane into a development.
Driveway width means the narrowest width of a driveway measured perpendicular to centerline of the driveway, from edge of pavement to edge of pavement or face-of-curb to face-of-curb where curb and gutter are installed.
Encroachment means the use of county rights-of-way by anyone other than county personnel or authorized agents for any specific purpose other than that generally intended.
GDOT means the Georgia Department of Transportation.
Governing body means the board of commissioners of Washington County, Georgia.
Guidelines. The proper design of driveways involves a number of design elements. Due to the complexity of the interaction between these design elements, exact design criteria cannot be specified for every possible situation. Therefore, design guidelines are included to assist the designer.
Island means a device used to separate or direct traffic in order to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of vehicles. An island may be a raised area that provides a physical barrier to channel traffic movements or a painted area.
Median crossover means an opening constructed in the median strip of a divided highway designed to allow traffic movements to cross from one side of the highway to the other. In some cases, the road department public works director may require the design to be such that some movements are physically prohibited.
MUTCD means the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (current edition).
NPDES means National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
Noncommercial driveway means. a driveway serving a school, government building, church, hospital or other noncommercial organization inviting public use. Provisions relating to commercial driveways will also generally be applicable to driveways serving these purposes.
O.C.G.A. means the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as amended.
Owner, applied to a building or land, includes any part owner, joint owner, tenant in common, tenant in partnership or joint tenant of the whole or of a part of such building or land.
Permit means a legal document issued by the county authorizing an applicant to do specific work in county rights-of-way.
Residential driveway means any private passageway to any property used for dwelling purposes. However, if a driveway provides access for more than four dwelling units, it shall be considered a commercial driveway.
Right-of-way line means a line that defines the limits of the ROW of a public road as it relates to adjacent property.
Right-of-way miter means a right-of-way line at an intersection, which is parallel to neither road but forms a triangle with extensions of the ROW lines of the adjacent sides of the intersecting roads. The purpose of the ROW miter is to provide improved visibility for vehicles approaching the intersection by enabling the county to eliminate visual obstructions or provide room for a traffic signal support pole or guy wire. A driveway should never be allowed along the ROW miter.
Rights-of-way (ROW) means all land under the jurisdiction of, and whose use is controlled by, the county.
Road, street means and includes streets, avenues, boulevards, roads, and all other public highways in the county.
Roadway means the portion of a highway, including shoulders, for vehicle use.
Sight distance, as used in this article, refers to intersection sight distance, which is the distance that can be seen along the main roadway by the driver of a vehicle on the driveway. The distance is measured based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 3.5 feet. Sight distance should be determined to provide adequate time for an entering vehicle to accelerate to within ten mph of posted speed limit, prior to being overtaken by approaching vehicles. (Refer to AASHTO, Green Book.)
Stopping sight distance means the sum of two distances: the distance traversed by the vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied and the distance required to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application begins. Stopping sight distance is measured based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 2.0 feet.
Utility means all privately, publicly or cooperatively owned water distribution and sanitary sewer facilities and systems for producing, transmitting or distributing communication, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, steam, wastewater and stormwater not connected with highway drainage, including river gages, fire and police signals, traffic control devices, and street lighting systems, which directly or indirectly serve the public or any part thereof.

DIVISION 2. - MAILBOXES

Sec. 26-71. - Policy.
No mailbox or newspaper delivery box (hereafter referred to as a mailbox) will be allowed to exist on county rights-of-way if it interferes with the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the county road system. A mailbox installation that does not conform to the provisions of this regulation is an unauthorized encroachment under O.C.G.A. § 32-6-1. The location and construction of mailboxes shall conform to the rules and regulations of the United States Postal Service as well as to standards established by the county. County standards for the location and construction of mailboxes are available from the county.
Sec. 26-72. - Acceptable standards for residential mailboxes.
Mailboxes shall be of light sheet metal or plastic construction conforming to the requirements of the United States Postal Service. Newspaper delivery boxes shall be of light sheet metal or plastic construction of minimum dimensions suitable for holding a newspaper. Mailbox supports shall not be set in concrete. A single four-inch by four-inch or four inch diameter wooden post or a metal post with a strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel hollow pipe and embedded no more than 24 inches into the ground will be acceptable as a mailbox support. A metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plat but it may have an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten inches below the ground surface. The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if a vehicle strikes the installation. Figures of acceptable attachment details and acceptable mailbox support assemblies are available from the county.
Sec. 26-73. - Removal of nonconforming or unsafe mailboxes.
The postal patron upon notification by the county shall remove any mailbox that is found to violate this policy. If such patron does not comply with the removal request it will be the county's prerogative to remove such mailbox. The following procedure may be used by the county to address an unacceptable mailbox:
(1)
A letter shall be sent by certified mail to the postal patron stating that the patron has 30 calendar days to remove or modify the unacceptable mailbox.
(2)
After 30 calendar days if the mailbox is not removed or made to comply, a second letter shall be sent by certified mail, advising the owner that the county will be removing the patron's mailbox after 15 calendar days.
(3)
After the time limit on the second letter has expired, the county may schedule the removal of the mailbox.
(4)
The removed mailbox will not be reinstalled but shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the removed mailbox is not possible out of the clear zone or on the patron's property by authorization, the mailbox shall be disposed of.
Secs. 26-74—26-100. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DRIVEWAYS

Sec. 26-101. - Purpose.
The purpose of the driveway permit process is to manage access on the county road system. Access regulations are necessary in order to preserve the functional integrity of the county road system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
Sec. 26-102. - When driveway permits are required.
A driveway permit is required prior to performing any construction work or nonroutine maintenance within the county rights-of-way. This generally includes residential and commercial driveways, but this may also include but is not limited to the following: grading, landscaping, drainage work, or construction of a development. Any revisions to any portion of existing driveways (i.e., widening and/or relocation that are within the county rights-of-way) shall also require a permit. In addition to being unlawful, performing the above-described work within the county rights-of-way without a permit shall entitle the county to barricade, displace, or otherwise close such driveway and to collect the costs thereof from the violator as provided for in this article.
Sec. 26-103. - Application.
(a)
Application to perform any construction or nonroutine maintenance work within county rights-of-way must be made to the county.
(b)
Application for a permit under these regulations will be accepted only from the property owner, leaser or an official representing the company, organization, or group, which owns or leases the property abutting the ROW and upon which the driveway will be constructed. In the event the applicant leases the property to be served by the driveway, the lease should be for a period of at least three years; otherwise the permit must be issued to the property owner. In any case, written acknowledgement of the permit work must be obtained from the owner or his agent. In cases where a site with multiple owners is being developed by a single entity under a development agreement, the developer may apply for the permit. A copy of the development agreement between the developer and all affected property owners must be included with the application. The agreement must give responsibility for developing all affected driveways to the entity that is making application. When application is made by an agent of the owner or if the owner is a partnership or corporation, written authorization allowing the agent to act on behalf of the owner must be provided by applicant. An application for right-of-way encroachment may be obtained from the county.
Sec. 26-104. - Preliminary site plan review.
For large developments, the applicant's engineer is encouraged to meet with the public works director early in the plan development process. A preliminary site plan is helpful to facilitate the exchange of information so the public works director can see the intent of the applicant. The preliminary site plan will also be useful in discussing the relevant requirements of these regulations.
Sec. 26-105. - Performance bonds for commercial driveways only.
Each applicant will provide a performance bond or letter of escrow to ensure that the authorized commercial driveway is accomplished in accordance with the approved permit. In cases of noncompliance, the bond will be used to offset the cost of correcting or removing uncompleted or unauthorized work, and to offset the cost of any damages incurred by the county or other parties as a result of the work or activities of the applicant in relation to this permit. The amount of the bond or letter of escrow is based on the estimated construction costs as determined by the county. A bond may be underwritten by a company housed outside of the state, if a state resident agent of said surety company countersigns. All letters of escrow must be from a bank housed in the state. Blanket performance bonds are acceptable. The blanket bond must contain the name of the owner or entity that is making application for permit. If the site is being developed on behalf of more than one owner under a development agreement, the surety must be in the name of the developer making application. A letter of credit from a bank housed in the state may be used for surety. It must be written without expiration or be written so as to automatically renew annually and the bank must agree to notify the county by registered letter at least 60 days prior to its expiration date if it does not intend to renew the letter of credit.
Sec. 26-106. - Plan requirements for commercial driveways only.
The applicant must submit construction drawings stamped by a registered engineer in the state with the permit application. Plans must conform to the minimum guidelines described herein. In addition, the applicant's engineer shall also use his judgment to prepare plans that conform to accepted guidance including but not limited to the most current edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets published by AASHTO and the GDOT Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control. When submitting plans for review, the applicant must provide four sets of construction drawings. The county prefers plans with 24 inch by 36 inch sheet size or smaller. A plan review checklist containing information that should be shown on the construction plans is available from the county.
Sec. 26-107. - Commercial driveway permit procedures.
The plan review and application process is initiated when the applicant or their engineer submits an application permit, the necessary construction drawings to the county and the application fee as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. When the county has completed its review of the permit and the plans and any necessary revisions have been made to their satisfaction, the applicant will be notified that his permit has been approved. The applicant is required to notify the county when the work will begin and when the work is complete. The works must be completed to the satisfaction of the county before the project can be accepted and the bond released. The project must be constructed according to the approved permitted plans. If, during the construction of the work, questions arise or unforeseen conditions are encountered, the contractor shall contact the county for consultation. The county will require as-built drawings if significant modifications are approved in the field. It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the pipe and driveway up to the roadway edge without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process including driveways installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
Sec. 26-108. - Residential driveway permit procedures.
(a)
The county administers residential driveway permits and the application fee, as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. The county will advise the applicant regarding location of the drive, the size pipe if required to be placed under the driveway, and approve the grading plan from the outer edge of the road to the ROW line. Residential driveways are, as the name implies, driveways to private residences. Normally they are a minimum 20 feet wide. It is recommended that turnarounds be provided to avoid vehicles backing into the roadway. Under special circumstances, certain design vehicles require more width to safely negotiate a turn into or out of the drive without stopping and/or backing on the roadway. The county may also approve a driveway wider than 20 feet. If the driveway is paved, but without curb and gutter, there should be at least two-foot shoulder along the drive and around the radii before beginning the slope down to the drainage ditch. The front slope, back slope and the slope around the end of the drain pipe under the drive, if present, should be the same as if it were a commercial driveway. All side drain pipes larger than 48 inches must have an inlet and an outlet headwall. Only safety headwalls or those specifically approved by the county are allowed. On residential driveways this can be accomplished in several ways. If the pipe is corrugated metal and the applicant chooses to cut the end off to provide a 6:1 or flatter slope, he may install a concrete "collar" around the pipe end to provide stability and control erosion. Metal cross members must then be firmly attached to the pipe or collar at not more than two-foot spacing. The end treatment will be acceptable in lieu of attaching a prefabricated metal safety end treatment when applied to a residential driveway. When residential driveways are used to accommodate a semi-truck and trailer, the county will require the applicant to enlarge the driveway width to a minimum of 40 feet wide or larger if needed to appropriately permit ingress and egress of such semi-tractors, without the tractor entering into the ditch or right-of-way, and to be responsible for all additional driveway pipe and installation costs. It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the pipe and driveway up to the roadway without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process including driveways installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Per this article, the county will no longer maintain or repair driveways. However, this article does permit the county to repair drop off areas immediately adjacent to the pavement or roadway surface. If, during routine county maintenance of a roadside ditch, a residential driveway pipe is discovered to be nonfunctional, it is the property owner's responsibility to replace the subject pipe. Should a driveway pipe create an unsafe roadway or right-of-way condition due to its nonfunction, the county may remove the driveway pipe to return the area to a safe condition. The removed driveway pipe shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the removed driveway pipe is not possible out of the clear zone or on the owner's property by authorization, the driveway pipe shall be disposed of.
(b)
A typical residential driveway plan and profile and other special requirements is available from the county. All driveway pipes must be made of corrugated metal or concrete pipe or DOT approved double walled type S composite pipe, must be of sufficient grade to withstand vehicular traffic, and must be of sufficient diameter to allow for anticipated flow of water. No used pipes will be permitted for installation of a permanent driveway.
(c)
The provisions of this section for residential driveways will not apply to driveways in place prior to enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived, but will apply to whole new renovations of existing driveways, as well as to all new driveways.
(Res. No. 2015-2, 2-17-2015)
Sec. 26-109. - Utility driveway permit procedures.
Utility driveways for accesses to utility sites such as power substations, water tanks, or telephone services sites are to be permitted by the county and should be treated much the same as a residential driveway for design and sight distance. The utility driveway must function in such a manner, which will allow the utility vehicle to pull completely off the roadway without stopping and backing into the drive or having to back out into roadway when exiting the driveway. The vehicle must not reduce the site distance for driveway located along the same section of roadway. A utility driveway will normally not count as one allowed access point along an applicant's frontage, depending on the length of frontage and safety considerations. A typical utility driveway layout is available from the county. The county will administer the issuance of permits and accompanying fee as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. Relocation of an existing driveway by county, state, and federal entities, within the ROW will not require issuance of a permit.
Sec. 26-110. - Farm use, logging, and mining driveways.
(a)
Farm use, logging and mining driveways are to be permitted in a manner similar to utility driveways. A logging driveway will be a temporary driveway. Such driveways are regulated under article III of this chapter, pertaining to timber operations. However, if the driveway is to be installed to become a farm use or any other use driveway, then a permit will be required and all provisions and requirements for a driveway permit must be met. A mining operation may require a more substantial design to function properly. All temporary driveways, as with all other driveways, must sufficiently provide for proper water flow, and must not impede anticipated water flow.
(b)
Signage requirements for driveways described in (a) above shall be the same as those for logging driveways as provided for in section 26-224(b).
(Res. No. 2015-2, 2-17-2015)
Sec. 26-111. - General restrictions.
No driveway approach or other improvements constructed on county ROW, as an exercise of the permit, shall be relocated or have its dimensions altered without the written permission of the county.
(1)
A letter from the county approving the change should be obtained by the applicant who received a copy of the original permit.
(2)
Parking is prohibited on county ROW except those instances where a temporary conditional special encroachment permit is approved for parking on the county ROW.
(3)
Driveways should not be provided within the county ROW for purposes of parking, loading, servicing, etc.
(4)
Geometric and safety requirements shall be maintained as stipulated in the permit and shall not be altered by the applicant.
(5)
The applicant must take possession of an approved permit within 60 days of approval. If not, the permit will be canceled.
(6)
Work under the permit shall begin within 90 days after approval. Failure to begin work will be cause for the permit to be canceled.
(7)
Construction work authorized by an approved permit shall be completed within 12 months following approval of the permit. Permitted work not completed within 12 months, for just reasons, may be officially extended, by the county, for an additional six months. If the permitted work is not completed, action will be taken to secure the bond, escrow or letter of credit in order to complete the work or restore the county ROW.
(8)
Once a permit has been canceled or voided, it cannot be reactivated or reinstated for any reason. A new permit must be submitted when the applicant is ready to begin work. This also includes the appropriate number of copies of up-to-date plans and all related documentation needed to review the application.
(9)
New driveways to new businesses should not be opened for use by the traveling public until the final inspection and release of any bond or escrow by the county. In order to insure a timely release, the applicant is encouraged to coordinate all phases of work with the county.
(10)
It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the commercial driveway up to the roadway edge of pavement without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process. Maintenance or replacement of the side drain pipe installed by the permittee will be their responsibility.
Sec. 26-112. - Ownership of completed work.
A median crossover constructed under a special encroachment permit or a commercial driveway permit becomes a feature of the roadway and the unconditional property of the county. The permit applicant or property owners and/or lessees adjacent to the ROW at the crossover site retain no ownership or legal interest therein. The county reserves the right and all authority to close, relocate or remove a crossover when such action is deemed necessary in the interest of public safety or efficiency of the roadway.
Secs. 26-113—26-140. - Reserved.
DIVISION 4. - ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND UTILITIES

Sec. 26-141. - Purpose.
Before any public utility may be installed or relocated within county ROW or across county ROW, application for a permit shall be made to the county. The application for the permit shall contain a description of the location, nature of the public utility, direction, height or depth, distance and such other information as the county may reasonably require. The term "public utility," for any purposes of this section, shall include but shall not be limited to water lines, gas lines, sewer lines, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, telecommunication cables, conduits and every other structure or device which by physical or electronic means conveys energy or substance, whether overhead or underground, along with supporting pedestals, poles and equipment.
Sec. 26-142. - Protection of traffic and roadway.
It is the policy of the county that no public utility may occupy the county ROW unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of roadway traffic is not unduly impaired and the utility installation does not prevent the county from reasonably maintaining the roadways, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the utility do not jeopardize the traffic, or the highway structure or the maintenance thereof.
Sec. 26-143. - Policy of relocation.
The county reserves the right to require the utility or entity that provides utility services to remove, repair, adjust or relocate any utility facilities installed within the county ROW of a road which the county has undertaken to improve, or intends to improve when, in the opinion of the county, the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the use of safe operation of such road by the traveling public or will interfere with such construction of maintenance. All utilities or entities providing utility services utilizing the county ROW are expected to react to the county's notification of proposed projects in time sufficient to assure removal or relocation so as not to adversely affect the county's construction schedule for the project. The utility owner may be held liable for any damages or excess costs of construction when delays are caused by failure of a utility to relocate within a reasonable time. Upon receiving written notification from the county to remove, relocate, repair or adjust its facilities which are using or occupying county ROW, which the county has undertaken to improve, the utility owner shall within 60 days thereafter begin arrangements for said removal, relocation, repair or adjustment in accordance with the written notification and instructions from the public works director. Should the owner fail to comply with such notice within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the facilities, the county may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal be begun not later than ten days from the receipt of the final notice.
Sec. 26-144. - Plans, specifications, and supervision of work.
Such work shall be done in accordance with construction plans and specifications prepared by a registered engineer in the state. These plans are subject to the approval of county, and the work shall be performed under the review of the county. In all cases, it will be necessary for project plans to show the size, type and extent of utility facilities located on county ROW. Also, in all cases, it will be necessary for the construction plans to show any proposed adjustment or relocation of the utility facilities within the county ROW.
Sec. 26-145. - Location of utilities within county rights-of-way.
(a)
Protection of service. Utilities are to be located so as to minimize the need for future adjustment to accommodate future roadway improvements and to permit access for servicing such facilities with minimum interference to roadway traffic. The county may, on a case-by-case basis, require the utility to be encased.
(b)
Longitudinal installations. Longitudinal installations are to be located on uniform alignment as near as practical to the ROW line, usually a five-foot offset, so as to provide a safe environment for traffic operation and preserve space for future roadway improvements or other utility installations. Underground pipeline installations are not to be located within the pavement or between the edge of pavement and the ditch or toe of front slope except where no other practical alternative exists and a special request for exception is submitted to and approved by the county.
(c)
Highway crossing installations. To the extent feasible and practicable, utility line crossing of the highway shall cross on a line generally normal to the highway alignment.
(d)
Clear roadside areas. The horizontal and vertical location of utilities within the roadway ROW limits shall conform to the clear roadside policies applicable for the system, type of roadway, and specific conditions for the particular roadway section involved. Aboveground utilities are a form of roadside obstacles, and their location must be consistent with the clearances applicable to all roadside obstacles for the type roadway involved.
(e)
Preservation of safety, visual quality and maintenance efficiency. Full consideration shall be given to the measures, reflecting sound engineering principles and economic factors, necessary to preserve and protect the integrity and visual quality of the highway, its maintenance efficiency, and the safety of highway traffic.
Sec. 26-146. - Depth of pipe or main.
No such pipe or main shall be laid upon any such ROW unless the same is at least 36 inches below the grade of such ROW, including 36 inches below the bottom grade of the ditch if crossing the ditch.
Sec. 26-147. - Preservation, restoration, cleanup.
(a)
Construction methods are to be in accordance with the GDOT's Standard Specifications, current edition. Unsatisfactory restoration work shall be promptly corrected by the permit applicant. If necessary, unsatisfactory restoration work will be corrected by the county and its cost billed to the permit applicant.
(b)
Drainage. Care must be taken in utility installations to avoid disturbing existing drainage facilities.
(c)
Vegetative management on the ROW. Cutting and trimming of trees and shrubs growing on the highway ROW shall be held to the minimum required for installation and preservation of utilities. Generally, the maximum amount of clearance allowed for the utility is ten feet. Bush hogging will be allowed in areas where it is done on a frequent enough basis to avoid unsightly cuttings.
Sec. 26-148. - Safety and convenience of traffic.
Traffic control for utility construction and maintenance operations shall conform to the MUTC. Individual traffic control plans may be required as directed by the county.
Sec. 26-149. - Closing of trenches.
Whenever open trenching is required for the installation or maintenance of utilities within the ROW, the work shall be so scheduled that not more than 500 feet of trench shall be open at any one time. More restrictive controls may be imposed where conditions warrant. Insofar as possible work shall be scheduled so that open excavations will not be left overnight. Where trenches or pits are within the clear roadside areas and cannot be backfilled before leaving the job site, they shall be cordoned off and protected by reflectorized or lighted barricades as appropriate, or by other safety means as deemed appropriate.
Sec. 26-150. - Storage of materials.
The storage of materials on the county ROW within the clear roadside area is prohibited, except upon specific approval by the county when no other practical alternative exists. When such approval is given special safety precautions may be necessary for the protection of highway traffic. Such precautions will be stipulated in the permit or in a separate approval. Storage of materials outside the clear roadside area shall be temporary only, for a sufficient duration to facilitate their incorporation into the construction, which shall be expeditiously pursued.
Sec. 26-151. - Pavement cuts.
No open cuts in pavement will be permitted except by special permission from the county when there is an emergency or for making a service tap on a line under the pavement when no other distribution line is available in the area where the service is required. In no event will an open cut be permitted when it is reasonably practical to bore, tunnel, etc., under the surface of the roadway.
Sec. 26-152. - Underground utilities and other pipes or lines.
(a)
It being the case that certain utilities, pipes, or lines that may run under county roads, may pose a hazard to said roads, utilities, lines, or pipes that run under a county road must be encased in a pipe which meets engineering standards or GDOT standards. The following list includes, but is not exhaustive, of all such utilities that must specifically meet these requirements: electric, gas, water, sewage, slurry, flowable suspendables, irrigation water, and any other pipe or line which may compromise the integrity of the road should failure occur.
(b)
Additionally, any utilities, pipes, or lines to be run underneath county roads must take the shortest route, that is, must be run as perpendicular to the road it crosses as practicable.
Sec. 26-153. - Disturbed areas.
The size of the disturbed area during installation shall be kept to a minimum.
Secs. 26-154—26-180. - Reserved.
DIVISION 5. - SPECIAL ENCROACHMENTS

Sec. 26-181. - Purpose.
This division describes the county's process and standard of review to allow other entities to grade, landscape or otherwise conduct roadside encroachment activity within, under, or over county ROW. The responsibility for maintenance of permitted roadside landscape activities that are constructed on county ROW by entities other than the county shall be borne by the permit entity.
Sec. 26-182. - Grading/excavating.
The elevation of the roadway may affect the ability of the adjacent property owner to fully utilize their property. In those cases, changes to the grade of the roadway ROW may be a less expensive option than the construction of a retaining structure outside the ROW. Where there is a documented benefit to the county, applicants may be permitted to grade the right-of-way to reduce the cost of development. Grading that requires tree removal within 500 feet of an outdoor advertisement sign is prohibited. The following general requirements for grading or excavating must be adhered to:
(1)
Typically, if an earth embankment is in place, it may be lowered but not totally removed. In "cut" sections a berm of four feet to six feet in height may be required between the roadway ditch or curb and the right-of-way line to prevent headlight glare from adjacent properties onto the roadway.
(2)
All slopes associated with allowable grading on county ROW shall be 4:1 or flatter.
(3)
Reimbursement for soil removal from county ROW shall be at a rate determined by the county.
(4)
Mitigation for tree removal or disturbance is required.
Sec. 26-183. - Aesthetics, landscaping, roadside development and maintenance, water on road.
Treatment of the roadside may be considered to conserve, enhance, and effectively display the indigenous character and quality of the environment it passes through by means of proper location, design, construction, and maintenance of their related features. All landscaping, roadside development and maintenance shall conform to the GDOT Standard Specifications, current edition, and any procedures and manuals maintained by the GDOT office of maintenance, including MOG 6160 (Roadside Development—Georgia Highway Landscape Guide). Maintenance management activities may include: selective tree and shrub pruning in conformance with industry standards for fine or standard pruning and/ or removal; introduction of predominately low maintenance native plants and subsequent maintenance of unmanaged natural areas or other maintained areas of the ROW. No crown reduction pruning or tree abuse shall be permitted. Any water placed on or in county roads or rights-of-way by means other than natural precipitation is prohibited, other than the temporary spraying of roads to clean off accumulated mud. Except that, on unpaved county roads, irrigation water shall be allowed to hit roads if the person responsible places reflective warning signs at least 1,000 feet but no more than 1,200 feet prior to the area in which the irrigation occurs, and provided that said signs are approved by the county and removed no later than 24 hours after the irrigation stops. In the event spraying of a paved road to clean off accumulated mud does occur, proper safety measures must be utilized including the placement of warning signs indicating wet or slippery roads, or the use of other safety measures as deemed appropriate.
(Res. No. 2014-11, 8-14-2014)
Sec. 26-184. - Grading and landscape permit considerations.
(a)
The county will give consideration for approval of grading and/or landscaping activities based on compatibility with primary use and protection of the county's investment in the roadway facility. Beneficial reasons for encroachment activity may include, but are not limited to the following:
(1)
Improved shoulder or clear zone distances.
(2)
Improved drainage.
(3)
Elimination of hazards and/or guardrail.
(4)
Reduced maintenance costs.
(b)
Applications are reviewed to determine the impact of the encroachment on the following:
(1)
Safety of motorists, pedestrians, and workers.
(2)
Design, construction, operation, maintenance, or integrity of the highway system.
(3)
Aesthetic.
(4)
Environment.
(5)
Existing drainage.
(c)
An encroachment activity may be considered when there is no cost to the county and all negative real value changes to the ROW are reimbursed to the county. Items of real value include the costs for recurring maintenance, material removed, and the value of trees and other vegetation. Care must be taken to prevent encroachments that devalue county ROW. The applicant shall be responsible for all liability for personal injury and property damages for permitted activities. Permit applications may be acceptable if all the following items are satisfied:
(1)
The county is compensated for removal of material or use of the ROW.
(2)
No safety hazard is created.
(3)
No additional maintenance is created.
(4)
No additional liability is assumed by the county.
(5)
No transportation use restriction is created.
(6)
No unwanted easement or other permanent ROW encumbrance is created.
(7)
Activity will not be detrimental to the future use or expansion of the roadway.
(d)
Permits will not be issued for encroachments if any of the following conditions exists:
(1)
The activity adversely affects the safety, capacity or integrity of the county road system.
(2)
The activity compromises or jeopardizes the drainage system on the ROW.
(3)
The activity is to grade, remove or prune trees, shrubs and groundcovers when the county has determined that the activities will significantly disrupt natural systems, roadside aesthetics, or have other negative impacts on the operation of the highway. Structural integrity and tree health as well as vegetative ground cover for erosion control are of primary importance to the maintenance of the ROW and shall not be compromised for purposes of grading to reduce development costs, day lighting, or landscaping development activities.
(4)
Tree removal and/or grading for "daylighting" purposes when there is no benefit to the ROW or traveling public.
(5)
The applicant has not complied with the provisions of prior permits.
Sec. 26-185. - Permit procedures.
All plans developed for a special encroachment permit shall be submitted to the county for review. In most cases, the applicant will be best served by providing four sets of preliminary site plans for an initial review. Upon receipt of an application with plans, the county shall check to ensure that plans and related documents are complete and meet the requirements of this procedure. The applicants will have 90 calendar days to revise the plans, should the county generate comments. New application submittal packages will be required after 90 days. The applicant shall submit two copies of the revised plans for final review by the county. If modifications to the plan are beyond the comments made or a major modification is made for other reasons, the plan should be treated as a preliminary submittal and rechecked.
Sec. 26-186. - Plan requirements for special encroachments.
When submitting plans for review, the applicant must provide four sets of construction drawings. The county prefers plans with 24 inch by 36 inch sheet size or smaller. A plan review checklist containing information that should be shown on the construction plans is available from the county.
Sec. 26-187. - Removal of nonconforming special encroachments.
The owner of a nonconforming special encroachment upon notification by the county shall remove any encroachment that is found to violate this policy. If such owner does not comply with the removal request it will be the county's prerogative to remove such encroachment. The following procedure may be used by the county to address a nonconforming special encroachment such as mailboxes, driveways, grading/excavating, etc.:
(1)
A letter shall be sent by certified mail to the owner stating that the owner has 30 calendar days to remove or modify the nonconforming encroachment.
(2)
After 30 calendar days if the nonconforming encroachment is not removed or made to comply, a second letter shall be sent by certified mail, advising the owner that the county will be removing the owner's nonconforming encroachment after 15 calendar days.
(3)
After the time limit on the second letter has expired, the county may schedule the removal of the nonconforming encroachment.
(4)
The removed nonconforming encroachment will not be reinstalled but shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the nonconforming encroachment is not possible out of the clear zone or on the owner's property by authorization, the nonconforming encroachment shall be disposed of.
(5)
A violation of this section is punishable by a fine up to $1,000.00 and or 60 days imprisonment. Additionally, any cost associated with such removal will be placed as a lien on the subject property.
