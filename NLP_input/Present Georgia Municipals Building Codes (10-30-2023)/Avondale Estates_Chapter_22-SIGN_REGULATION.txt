Cross reference— Zoning, ch. 21.

ARTICLE I. - INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
DIVISION 1. - LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Sec. 22-1. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Findings. Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the city's overall neighborhood character as well as an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of identifying addresses, which is a benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. In addition, directional signs are used for the sole purpose of ensuring safe movement of vehicles entering and exiting property to and from public rights-of-way, private roads and driveways. While such signage may be referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
(c)
Intent of board of mayor and commissioners. The intent of these regulations is to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and
(2)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, which is expressly incorporated herein; and
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and others within the city; and
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; and
(5)
Promote the aesthetic qualities of the city; and
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; and
(7)
Promote economic development; and
(8)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
(9)
Promote the stated purposes of the ordinance, which are expressly incorporated herein.
(d)
Intent of sign regulations. Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this chapter, any sign authorized under this chapter can contain any message, other than messages containing obscenity as defined herein, or other than a sign that advertises an activity that is illegal under state or federal laws.
(Ord. No. O-2022-02, § 2(Att.), 1-12-2022)
Sec. 22-2. - Applicability.
The regulation and requirements of this chapter apply to all signs that are or are intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way, a private street, or adjacent property.
(Ord. No. O-2022-02, § 2(Att.), 1-12-2022)
Sec. 22-3. - Severability.
In the event any section, paragraph, phrase, or sentence of this chapter is invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect the remaining sections, paragraphs, phrases or sentences of this chapter, it being the intention of the board of mayor and commissioners that provisions of this chapter are severable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

A legal nonconforming sign is a sign that was lawfully erected and maintained pursuant to the applicable regulations at the time that it was erected but, by reason of subsequently adopted or amended regulation no longer conforms to one (1) or more provisions of this chapter.
(b)

(b)
Nothing in this section shall prevent the owner of a legal nonconforming sign from continuing to maintain such sign, nor prevent an owner from making routine changes to the copy or text of an existing nonconforming sign, so long as such change does not enlarge the size or height of the sign face, does not change the nature of the sign structure, and does not so alter the sign in a manner that it would require a building permit.

DIVISION 2. - MEASUREMENTS

Sec. 22-241. - Computation of sign area.
In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this Chapter; the following shall establish how sign areas are measured.
(1)
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the sign modules, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
(2)
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign.
(3)
For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one (1) view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign.
(4)
For wall and projecting signs, the computation of the area of the sign copy shall include the full sign structure, including channel letters, cabinets, back plates, and any portion of the sign not integral to the structure of the building.
(5)
For any changeable copy sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
(6)
The computation of area of sign copy for all other signs shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign copy or a sign module.
(7)
Treatment of blank spaces. Any blank space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign copy, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign copy, sign module, or sign structure.
