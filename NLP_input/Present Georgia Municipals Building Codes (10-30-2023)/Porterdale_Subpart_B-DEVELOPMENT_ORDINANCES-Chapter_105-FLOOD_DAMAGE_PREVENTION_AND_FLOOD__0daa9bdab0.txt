Chapter 105 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION AND FLOOD AREA REGULATIONS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 8-24-2017(1) , § 1, amended Ch. 105 in its entirety to read as herein set out. The former Ch. 105 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 2003, §§ 34-101.1—34-101.6; and Ord. of 8-6-2007. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis.

Sec. 105-1. - Intent and disclaimer.
(a)
Intent. The intent of this chapter is to regulate and restrict uses and structures within floodplain areas of the city in order to protect life and property, to prevent or minimize the hazards and damage which follow periods of severe inundation and to reduce the public cost of rescue efforts, relief efforts and flood control activities made necessary by such inundation; to protect the natural function and character of the floodplain and surrounding areas; and to enable owners of property within the city to qualify for national flood insurance.
(b)
Disclaimer of liability. The city council finds the degree of flood protection required by this chapter to be reasonable and consistent with historically established and nationally accepted levels of protection based on scientific and engineering practices. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the floodway, floodplain, special flood hazard area, or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 )
Sec. 105-2. - Flood insurance study and maps adopted.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance study, flood hazard boundary map and flood insurance rate map, for the City of Porterdale, Georgia, effective March 17, 2014 or as it may be revised, shall constitute the official flood maps for the city. Revisions of such maps shall include but not be limited to future conditions maps. All land shown on said maps as lying within a "special flood hazard area", and all other land subject to inundation during the base flood, as confirmed by a flood study or a field run survey, shall be subject to the regulations set forth in this chapter.
( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 )

Appeal means a request for a review of the enforcement entity's interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, also known as the 100-year flood.
Base flood elevation means the highest water surface elevation anticipated at any given point during the base flood.
City means the staff, employees, and elected officials of the City of Porterdale, or other entities acting on behalf of the city.
Development means a land development or land development project.
Elevated structure means an existing structure which has been raised or rebuilt in compliance with this chapter.

( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 )
Sec. 105-4. - Permits required.
(a)
Permit required. Use of lands and buildings, and construction, reconstruction, repair, modification or demolition of any structure within all floodplains, including special flood hazard areas, shall require review and approval of a permit by the city.
(b)
Flood study or field run survey required. The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps, more particularly described and adopted by the city in section 105-2, are used for general reference purposes only. A flood study or a field run survey may be required to determine the location and extent of the floodplain area on a specific parcel.
(1)
Flood study. In an unmapped floodplain or in a mapped floodplain where elevation has not been established, a flood study may be required in order to establish the base flood elevation. Such a flood study shall address, at a minimum, impact to upstream, downstream and adjacent properties, and the free flow of flood waters.
(2)
Field run survey. In order to establish the horizontal extent of the vertical floodplain elevation, a field run survey may be required to establish the actual location of the limit when proposed development is proximate to the limits of a floodplain/floodway.
(3)
A flood study or field run survey required under this subsection shall be certified by either a professional engineer or registered land surveyor.
(c)
Review and approval. Any proposal which includes any of the activities described in this chapter shall be submitted to the city for review before any such activity is commenced. The city may authorize the approval of any of such activities upon a finding, based on detailed plans and specifications submitted with the proposal, that the activity can be completed and occupied or used in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter. No part of any such activity shall be commenced before such permit approval has been issued and all other permits and licenses required by applicable law have been issued or obtained.
(d)
Permit revocation. The city may revoke any such permit when the city determines the activity is not being accomplished, or that the land is not being used or occupied, as shown on the plans and specifications approved by the city. A permit approval so revoked may be reinstated upon application by the holder under such rules and conditions as are established by the city consistent with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws.
(e)
Protection of existing flood storage and protection of upstream, downstream, and adjacent lands from flooding. The city shall not, by authorizing the approval of a permit under the authority of this chapter, authorize any use of land, any extension or enlargement of a use of land which existed before the original date of enactment of the provisions of said chapter, or the commencement of any of the activities described in this chapter, where the effect thereof would be to decrease the volume of existing flood storage on that land or to increase flooding conditions upstream, downstream or adjacent to that land.
(1)
Protection of floodways. The floodway shall be that as defined in the flood insurance study and maps, City of Porterdale, Georgia, Newton County, Federal Emergency Management Agency, effective March 17, 2014 or as it may be subsequently revised or extended. On those watercourses and rivers regulated hereunder where the floodway has not been defined in the said flood insurance study and until such time as these watercourses and rivers are defined in an officially adopted or revised flood insurance study, the floodway shall be defined as the channel of the watercourse or river and the adjacent areas of the defined or undefined floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot upstream of, downstream of, or at the point being considered. No fill or encroachments shall be placed within the defined floodway that would impair the ability to carry and discharge the waters resulting from the 100-year base flood.
(2)
Floodplain protection. The city shall not authorize the approval of any permit authorizing the placement of fill or stored materials, or the construction of any building or other structure within the floodplain, other than public purpose or public use infrastructure. Earth-disturbing activities in the floodplain shall be permitted only when the resulting configuration shall allow stormwater to enter the floodway by sheet flow (not channelized flow) and results in no loss of existing flood volume. Any earth-disturbing activities within a floodplain shall be subject to requirements of stream bank buffer limits and should be constructed using best management practices for soil erosion and sedimentation control. The use of compensating excavation or contouring procedures to modify flood hazard limits may only apply to install necessary public infrastructure within the flood limits to support existing and new property(s) which are not within the flood limits, and for purposes of creating or maintaining walkways and/or trails dedicated to public use.
All applications for permits issued by the city which would allow any use or construction wholly or partly in a special flood hazard area shall include detailed plans and specifications which demonstrate that no expansion of a special flood hazard area would result from the work which would be authorized by any such permit. No such permit shall authorize any proposed use or construction which would have a finished elevation less than two feet higher than the nearest base flood elevation and that would be closer than 15 feet from the nearest base flood elevation, and no such permit shall be issued until the plans and specifications submitted are in compliance with this chapter and have been authorized by the city. Any comments or requirements endorsed on such plans and specifications or on an addendum thereto, by the city shall become a part of any permit issued for the work covered by the plans and specifications and shall be enforced as are all other requirements applicable to such permit.
(3)
Modification to existing structures or existing usages of the floodplain in violation of, but predating the provisions of this chapter. Minor modifications and routine maintenance of uses and structures which were lawful prior to the original date of enactment of the provisions of this chapter, including existing structures, fills, pavements, utilities, manufactured homes, mobile homes, mobile home sites and other facilities, shall be subject to the following restrictions:
a.
Permitted modifications of existing structures or existing usage. Any modification to an existing usage, when such existing usage is in violation of this chapter, that enhances the protection of life or property or which is reasonably necessary to the maintenance and upkeep of the property concerned and which does not extend the scope and magnitude of the existing violation of these regulations, is permitted provided the value of such modification or maintenance does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the structure or total existing usage prior to such modification or maintenance, excluding the value of the land but including the value of existing structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of that existing usage.
b.
Modifications requiring additional measures. Any improvement, modification or maintenance and any repairs or reconstruction required by any reason, including damages arising from normal deterioration, flood, other natural act or accident, of any existing usage where such existing usage is in violation of this chapter, shall bring that existing usage under the scope of the regulations set forth in this subsection; and that existing usage shall be brought into compliance with this chapter, providing that the total value of such improvement, modification, maintenance, repair or reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the value of the structure or existing usage before such improvement, modification or maintenance or before such flood, other natural act or accident, excluding the value of the land but including the prior value of structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of the existing usage prior to the event.

( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 )
Sec. 105-8. - Indemnity agreements.
The city finds that the construction of new structures, the elevation and flood protecting of existing structures, the installation of a swimming pool or other in-ground water features, or the construction of a parking lot in a special flood hazard area generally will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. However, as stated in City Code section 105-1(b), such improvements may be subject to inundation under certain conditions. Therefore, prior to the issuance of any permit for construction of a new structure, the elevation of an existing structure, the installation of a swimming pool or other in-ground water feature, or the construction of a parking lot in a special flood hazard area, the owner of the subject property shall execute an indemnification and hold harmless agreement, in a form provided by the city, which shall state at a minimum, that owner shall indemnify and hold harmless the city for any damages or claims for damages, suits, costs, judgments losses, and injuries arising out of the owner's construction, maintenance, use or removal of said improvements. The indemnification shall be filed and recorded in the land records of the county in which the property lies and shall be a permanent covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon the successors in title of the owner.
( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 )
Sec. 105-9. - Appeal.
