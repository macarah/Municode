Sec. 74. - (Restatement) Street railroads.
Be it further enacted, that whenever any street railroad tracks are laid in said city on a street which has already been paved or permanently improved, said city commission may require such contribution or payment from said street railroad company or its owners at the time of laying such tracks, on account of the paving or improvement of such street, as the said city commission may deem proper. Said city may enforce the collection of such amount by execution, and may require payment of same before consent is granted to lay such tracks, and may grant consent conditioned on such payment thereafter. Such street railroad and its owners shall also be liable for its pro rata of the cost of repaving or repairing said street when the same is done, according to law.
