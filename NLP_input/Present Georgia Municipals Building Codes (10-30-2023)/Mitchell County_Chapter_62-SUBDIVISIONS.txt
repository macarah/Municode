Street intersections. All street intersections and junctions shall be at right angles, unless otherwise approved for good cause by the planning commission, but in no case shall they be less than 70 degrees. In addition, at all street intersections and junctions, there shall be a sight distance of at least 125 feet in all street directions, and the profile flattened at intersections to provide an area of not over five percent grade extending at least 40 feet each way from the intersection.
(12)
Street paving. Said streets shall be paved prior to the final plat approval. The paving shall be done within the times and temperatures recommended by the state department of transportation for county-maintained roads.
