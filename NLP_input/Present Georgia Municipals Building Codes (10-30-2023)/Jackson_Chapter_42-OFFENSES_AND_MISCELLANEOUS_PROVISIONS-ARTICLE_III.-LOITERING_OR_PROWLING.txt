DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 42-61. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish jurisdiction in the municipal court of the city, pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 16-11-36 and 16-6-24, to try and dispose of cases of loitering, prowling or loitering or related activities in public for the purpose of procuring others to engage in any sexual acts for hire.
(Ord. No. 96-19, 5-21-1996)
Sec. 42-62. - Defined; acts constituting cause for alarm.
(a)
A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(b)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this article, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this article if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(Ord. No. 96-19, art. I(A), (B), 5-21-1996)
