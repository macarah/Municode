Sec. 700-10. - Purposes.
700-10.01
This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Hiram, Georgia, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City incorporated so as to protect the health, safety, and integrity of residential neighborhoods, and to foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. This ordinance shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. This ordinance is intended to promote the City as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall:
A.
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within the incorporated limits of Hiram;
B.
Protect Hiram's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
C.
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
D.
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
E.
Maximum use of any new and existing telecommunications towers through collocation so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
F.
Maximum and encourage use of alternate telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
G.
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications activities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

Sec. 700-30. - Applicability; Standards; Application Procedure.
700-30.01
Applicability.
A.
District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
B.
Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority.
C.
Amateur radio, receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas.
D.
Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements of this ordinance, other than the requirements of article III, section B(4) and (5). Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this ordinance as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas."
700-30.02
Standards Applicable To All Towers And Antennas. No tower or antenna shall be located in the City of Hiram, Georgia except as set forth in this ordinance. The following standards shall apply to all towers and antennas, unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby:
A.
Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
B.
Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the Community Development Department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the geographic area of the City of Hiram, Georgia, or within one-half mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower (pursuant to section C of this article). The Community Development Department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within this the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however, that the Community Development Department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
C.
Aesthetics; Lighting. The guidelines set forth in this paragraph shall govern the locations of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. The determination whether a proposed tower or antenna meets these requirements shall be within the discretion of the Hiram City Council. This list is not an exclusive list of the aesthetic issues the governing authority may consider; these are merely guidelines. The governing authority may consider any factor that serves the goals and purposes of this ordinance.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
5.
In designing a tower facility, the aesthetics of the tower shall be considered and the least visually obtrusive design shall be implemented.
D.
Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
E.
Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.
F.
Location And Development. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
G.
Vegetation And Topography. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
H.
Design Of Related Structures. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
I.
Number Of Towers Per Lot. Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
J.
Maximum Height. The maximum height for all tower facilities in the city, unless otherwise exempt from these standards as set forth in article III herein, located within all agricultural, residential and commercial zoning categories shall be 195 feet. The maximum height for all tower facilities in the city, unless exempt from these standards as set forth in article III herein, located within all industrial zoning categories shall be 250 feet.
K.
Setback for Towers. Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way, plus 100 feet.
L.
Setback for Accessory Facilities; Towers in Yards. Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for front, side, and rear yards. In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard, or side yard in a residential district.
M.
Historic and Scenic Views; Visual Clutter. Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing authority or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
N.
Fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing installed along the perimeter of the compound not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
O.
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers:
1.
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent properties. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least ten feet wide outside the required fence.
2.
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, as determined by the Paulding County Community Development Department, in partnership with the Hiram City Manager, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
3.
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may provide an adequate buffer at the discretion of the Paulding County Community Development Department, and the Hiram City Manager.
P.
Design for Multiple Users. Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100 feet, up to 120 feet, shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least three users. Furthermore, for every additional 20 feet of height, said tower shall be designed to accommodate an additional user.
