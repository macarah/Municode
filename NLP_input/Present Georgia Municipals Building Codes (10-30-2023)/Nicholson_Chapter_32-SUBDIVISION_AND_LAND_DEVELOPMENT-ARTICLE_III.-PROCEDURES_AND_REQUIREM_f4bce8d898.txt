ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAT AND PLAN APPROVAL

Sec. 32-81. - Pre-application conference.
Whenever a person proposes the subdivision of a tract of land or any land development, he is encouraged (but not required) to consult early and informally with the administrative officer. The prospective subdivider or land developer may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and its vicinity, and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision or land development. This pre-application conference is intended to permit an early evaluation of the subdivider's or land developer's intentions, to ensure coordination with the comprehensive plan, and to provide the subdivider or land developer with the necessary laws, rules, and regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed project. No formal application shall be required.

(8)
Metes and bounds bearings and distances and areas. Bearings of all lines of the boundary or lot lines, and distances of all boundary or lot lines, and area of the parcels expressed in acres or square feet.

All angular directions shall be represented in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Distances that are shown for proximity purposes only and have not been measured shall be clearly labeled as "approximate." A metes and bounds description shall describe all courses in logical sequence around a lot or tract in a clockwise direction such that the ending point is the beginning point.
