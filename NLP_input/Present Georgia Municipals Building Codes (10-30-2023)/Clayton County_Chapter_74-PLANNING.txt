Sec. 74-4. - Standards of review.
(a)
In ruling on any application for zoning map amendment, the board of commissioners shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the county. In doing so, they will consider one or more of the following factors as they may be relevant to the application:
(1)
The existing land use pattern.
(2)
The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts.
(3)
The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing the load on public facilities, including, but not limited to, schools, utilities and streets.
(4)
The costs to the county and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures.
(5)
The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality and quantity.
(6)
Whether the proposed zoning map amendment will be a deterrent to the value or an improvement of development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulation.
(7)
Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations.
(8)
The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area.
(9)
The extent to which the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent with the land use plan.
(10)
The possible effects of the proposed zoning map amendment on the character of a zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area or the community.
(11)
The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations.
(12)
Applications for a zoning map amendment which do not contain specific site plans carrying a rebuttable presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme.
(13)
The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight.
(14)
In those instances in which property fronts on major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight.
After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the board of commissioners shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. It will not be required that the board of commissioners consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.
(b)
If the board of commissioners determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable provisions as may be imposed by the commissioners. Otherwise such application shall be denied.
(c)
In ruling on any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge of the existing zoning classification, the commissioners will follow these general lines of inquiry:
(1)
The existing uses of and present zoning of the subject and nearby property.
(2)
The extent to which the petitioner's property is devalued by the existing zoning classification in relation to similarly zoned and similarly situated property.
(3)
The extent to which the devaluation, if any, of the applicant's property promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.
(4)
The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed upon the applicant.
(5)
The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes.
(6)
The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property.
(7)
The extent to which the existing zoning classification promotes the purposes of and is consistent with this section and accompanying official zoning map.
The existing zoning classification shall be considered presumptively valid and it shall be the responsibility of the petitioner to present evidence in rebuttal of this presumption.
(d)
If the board of commissioners determines from the evidence presented that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the petitioner and is not offset by considerations of the public health, safety, morals and welfare and considerations of the integrity of this section and the official zoning map, the commissioners may impose upon such property an appropriate zoning classification, including provisions which might be consistent with these considerations and the considerations contained in subsection (a) of this section.

In making this determination, the historic preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and materials of the architectural feature involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures, buildings, objects, or works of art in the immediate neighborhood in accordance with the adopted design guidelines.
(2)
The historic preservation commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic, architectural significance and value of the historic property.
(e)
Public hearing on applications for certificates of appropriateness, notices, and right to be heard. At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness the historic preservation commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application and shall give applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. Notice in Clayton County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be sufficient action.
In cases where the historic preservation commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application, noticed in Clayton County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County at least one time not less than ten days nor more than 20 days prior to the hearing.
At such hearing, any interested party shall be given the opportunity to comment on the request.

The historic preservation commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness within no more than 45 days after the filing of a complete application by the owner or authorized agent of a historic property. Failure of the historic preservation commission to act within such 45 days shall constitute approval and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.
(i)
Necessary actions to be taken by historic preservation commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness:
(1)
In the event the historic preservation commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The historic preservation commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
(2)
In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure, building, object or work of art which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.
(j)
Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the historic preservation commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the historic preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter.
(k)
Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted by the building official before it is completed. Any such work shall be considered a violation of this chapter subject to any and all appropriate fines and penalties.

Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable.
(m)
Recording of applications for certificates of appropriateness. The historic preservation commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all the historic preservation commission's proceedings in connection with such application.
(n)
Acquisition of property. The historic preservation commission may, when and only when such action is authorized by the board of commissioners, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein.
(o)
Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the historic preservation commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the board of commissioners; the appeal must be applied for within 30 days after notification is sent. The mayor and commission may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the historic preservation commission if the governing body finds that the historic preservation commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision.
Appeals from decisions of the board of commissioners made pursuant to this chapter may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations.
(p)
Department of transportation and local governments. The department of transportation and any contractors, including cities and counties, performing work funded by the department of transportation are exempt from this chapter. Local governments are exempt from the requirement of obtaining certificates of appropriateness; provided, however, that local government shall notify the historic preservation commission 45 days prior to beginning an undertaking that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness and allow the commission an opportunity to comment.

(e)
Demolition or relocation criteria. The historic preservation commission's decision concerning the certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation of a historic site, landmark, or building shall be based on the following criteria:
(1)
The structure is of such interest or quality it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as a historic property.
(2)
The structure, building, object or work of art is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense.
(3)

Sec. 74-88. - Change in use.
(a)
A total change in the use or occupancy of any existing building which would cause a greater hazard to the public shall not be made unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes, and standards for the new use or occupancy; provided, however, the compliance alternative provisions of this chapter may be utilized by authorized enforcement authorities where total or strict compliance with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes or standards is not practical.
(b)
When the proposed use is of equal or lesser hazard as determined by an authorized enforcement authority, further compliance with any code for new construction is not required unless otherwise provided in this chapter. Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect the performance of the building may be made with like materials. Any proposed change to the existing building or change in type of contents of the existing building shall not increase the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures. If the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures is increased, then requirements of applicable construction of fire safety codes for exterior walls shall apply.

Sec. 74-89. - Changes in use of a portion of a building.
(a)
If a portion of a building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is separated from the remainder of the building with vertical or horizontal fire separations complying with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes, or standards or with compliance alternatives, then the portion changed shall be made to comply to the applicable requirements for the new use or occupancy to the extent noted in section 7-5-8.
(b)
If a portion of the building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is not separated from the remainder of the building as noted in subsection (a) hereinabove, then the provisions of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes, and standards applying to each use or occupancy of the building shall apply to the entire building to the extent noted in section 7-5-8; provided, however, if there are conflicting provisions in requirements for the various uses or occupancies, the authorized enforcement authority shall apply the strictest requirements.
(Ord. No. 2002-50, § 1, 5-21-02)
Sec. 74-90. - Floor loading.
Any proposed change in the use or occupancy of an existing building or portion thereof which could increase the floor loading should be investigated by a Georgia-registered professional engineer to determine the adequacy of the existing floor system to support the increased loads. If the existing floor system is found to be inadequate, it should be modified to support the increased loads or the proposed allowable floor loading shall be reduced by and posted by the appropriate enforcement authority.
(Ord. No. 2002-50, § 1, 5-21-02)
