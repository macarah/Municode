DIVISION 21. - SAFETY POLICY

Sec. 2-606. - Statement of safety policy.
(a)
The safety of all county employees is of paramount interest and importance. The county commissioners and county manager are dedicated to the effective control of accidents through enlightened employees.
(b)
Safety is a responsibility that we all must share, management and labor alike. The county is committed to provide a safe working environment for all its employees. Each employee, in turn, is responsible for practicing good safety habits on the job and for reporting hazardous working conditions or unsafe equipment. It is our goal to reduce accidental injuries and property damage. To do this, we must have everyone's cooperation. It is in a condition of employment for all employees to conduct their work in a safe and healthful manner.
(c)
The safety and loss control manual codified in this division has been developed to outline policies and procedures required to ensure safe performance of county operations. Features of this manual were developed from basic safety philosophies used in government and industry over the years. County employees are expected to follow this manual as a guideline for preventing accidents and other losses that may result in many situations, conditions, or events that impact your work.
(1)
Purpose and scope. The purpose of this safety and loss control manual is to provide guidelines to assist employees and supervisors in controlling all types of accidents. If these guidelines are followed, safe practices can be applied to any and all departments, preventing accidents, eliminating human suffering, improving services rendered to the public and reducing accident costs.
(2)
Safety and loss control philosophy.
a.
Accidents can be controlled through good safety and loss control programs. The basic key to a successful program is development of safe practices through the training for all employees.
b.
Safety is defined as a condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss. Loss control is more comprehensive and includes proper training, control of accidents, and other situations, conditions, and events that interfere with or interrupt job performance.
c.
The county's safety and loss control program recognizes that the same factors apply to accident controls that apply to providing a service to our citizens. Jobs that offer unnecessary danger to our employees must be discontinued until the unsafe condition is eliminated and/or safe practices are provided.
