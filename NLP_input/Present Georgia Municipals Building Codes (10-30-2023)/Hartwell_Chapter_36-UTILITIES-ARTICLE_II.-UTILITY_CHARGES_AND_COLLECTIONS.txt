ARTICLE II. - UTILITY CHARGES AND COLLECTIONS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 36-19. - Payment of costs of extending utility distribution lines.
(a)
The city council hereby finds that, as provided throughout this City Code, including, but not limited to, in sections 36-150, 36-281(d), and 36-552 of this Code, when the owner of a property that is not adjacent to an existing utility distribution line requests that the city extend its utility line to such property, the City of Hartwell, Georgia, does not pay the costs of extending a utility distribution line in such circumstances. The city finds that this policy is sound and appropriate in the vast majority of cases.
(b)
The city further finds, however, that notwithstanding any other limitation, restriction or requirement in this Code, if in the opinion of the city council, a particular proposed development would provide a significant economic development benefit to the citizens of Hartwell generally, and the benefits of such development exceed the costs of such extension, then the city shall be authorized, but not obligated, to pay some or all of the costs of extending certain utility distribution lines to the boundary of the property, as the city council may approve in each case.
(c)
In assessing the economic development benefit of a proposed project, the city shall consider any and all probable economic development benefits that may accrue to the city, including, but not limited to, the quality and quantity of jobs created by such development, any impacts on tourism, the possibility that such development may attract other economic development or cause other projects or businesses to locate in the City of Hartwell or its vicinity, and such other factors that involve benefits to the general public, in the opinion of the city council.
(d)
The city shall not be obligated to consider any proffered benefit if the city council determines, in the opinion of the city council, that such benefit is not reasonably probable.
(e)
The city shall not be obligated to consider any proffered benefit if the city council determines, in the opinion of the city council, that such benefit is likely to accrue to only the owner or developer of the proposed project, the owner of the property where the project will be located, or a small group of persons, and not to the public generally.
(f)
The city shall be authorized to require the owner or developer of a proposed project to satisfy such conditions as the city council may require before the city agrees to pay any such costs. These conditions may vary from project to project depending on the circumstances, and may include construction completion deadlines or milestones, job creation guaranties, utility usage guaranties, provision of bonds or letters of credit to secure any such agreements or guaranties, and such other conditions as the city council may decide to impose in a particular situation, in the opinion of the city council. Any such conditions shall be confirmed and memorialized in an enforceable contract between the city, the owner of the property, the developer, or such party or parties as the city deems appropriate.
(g)
If the city determines to pay a portion or all of the costs of extending a utility line or lines in a particular case, then the city may pay only actual, reasonable, and bona fide costs of extending such line or lines, including, but not limited to, costs of acquiring any required right-of-way or easements, costs of construction, and costs of materials.
(h)
Nothing in this article shall obligate the city to pay the costs of extending any utility lines or lines for a particular project or projects under any circumstances. The city retains discretion to act in these matters as the city council deems in the best interest of the city and its citizens.
(i)
This article shall not apply to the costs of improvements within a residential subdivision, such as pavement, water and sewer lines, electrical power, and similar matters.

Maintain the customer's pipes and service apparatuses in a good and sound manner;
(2)
Inspect for leaks and other defects periodically; and
(3)
Arrange for the prompt repair of leaks in a good and workmanlike manner.
(b)
The customer's duty applies to all pipes, even if the pipe is underground or otherwise not readily visible unless otherwise specifically provided in this Code.
(c)
It is the city's policy to charge customers for utility services distributed to the customer, even when a customer uses utility services inadvertently, such as when services are consumed due to leaks in the customer's pipes or service apparatus, even if the leak was underground or otherwise not readily visible to the customer.
(d)
Notwithstanding the city's general policy requiring that a customer pay for utility services distributed to the customer, regardless of the cause, the city may, in its discretion, provide monetary relief to the consumer for services consumed due to an undetected leak, but only by giving the customer a credit on the customer's utility bill, and only in limited circumstances, as provided in this chapter.

Sec. 36-96. - Same—Conditions for credit.
The city may give a city water or sewer consumer credit under this division, in the following circumstances:
(1)
The consumer must be a residential or commercial customer. No credit shall be provided for industrial accounts or other accounts except residential accounts and commercial accounts. For the purposes of this section, an account shall be classified as "residential" or "commercial" (and thus eligible for consideration of a credit) if the account was classified as a residential or commercial account when the account was opened.
(2)
The customer must prove to the city's satisfaction that there is or was a leak in the customer's system and that the leak was underground or was otherwise not readily detectable by reasonable means.
(3)
The customer must produce proof, satisfactory to the city, that a licensed professional was hired to repair the leak and did repair the leak. Proof may be in the form of a written statement from the licensed professional on a form satisfactory to the city.
(4)
The customer must continue to pay the amount of his average monthly bill, as determined by the city, while adjustments are in process.
(5)
The customer may utilize the credit only once in a period of 12 months.

Sec. 36-97. - Same—Calculation of credit.
The credit under section 36-96 shall be applied to the two highest corresponding utility service bills from the period when the leak was present. The credit shall be calculated separately for each bill as follows:
(1)
The amount of the customer's average utility bill for the corresponding service shall be calculated using the bills from the last 12 months before the date on which the credit is being calculated, and dividing the total of all the bills by 12.
(2)
The customer shall receive a credit on the highest bill equal to one-half of the difference between the amount of the bill and the average monthly bill (a credit equal to one-half of the excess).
(3)
The customer shall receive a credit on the second highest water bill equal to one-half of the difference between the amount of the bill and the average monthly bill (a credit equal to one-half of the excess).
(4)
The customer shall:
a.
Not receive any other credits;
b.
Pay the balance of the two highest bills; and
c.
Pay the full amount of all other bills.
