Sec. 113-1. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
By enacting this chapter, the mayor and council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and others within the city;
(3)
Reduce traffic hazards, pedestrian hazards, and other hazards;
(4)
Promote and maintain the aesthetic qualities of the city;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Promote economic development;
(7)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations;
(8)
Promote the stated purposes of the City of Lilburn zoning ordinance, as amended, which are expressly incorporated herein; and
(9)
Promote the stated purposes of the state building code, as adopted and modified by the City of Lilburn, which are expressly incorporated herein.

Should the director deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing to the applicant before the 30th business day after denial. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, not the date of the original submission. A permit shall not be denied or revoked except for due cause, being the violation of the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements.

Appeal. A person whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision of the director to the zoning board of appeals as provided. The decision of the zoning board of appeals is final.

Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
(2)
The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.
(3)
Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to others similarly situated.
(4)
The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant.
(5)
The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.

Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of an offense, and upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be subject to a penalty or not less than $25.00 nor more than $1,000.00, or by confinement in the City of Lilburn Jail for a total time not to exceed 60 days, or both, and may not be stayed or suspended. Each day shall constitute a separate offense.
(3)
The city may seek affirmative equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to cause the removal or repair of any sign in violation of this or other city ordinances.
(4)
The zoning enforcement officer or his/her designee may remove any sign or structure illegally placed upon a public right-of-way without any notice and may dispose of said sign or structure by taking it to any landfill.

Sec. 113-24. - Severability.
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, or word of this chapter is declared and adjudged to be invalidated or unconstitutional, such declaration or adjudication shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect as if such portion so declared or adjudged unconstitutional were not originally part of this chapter, even if the surviving parts of the chapter result in greater restrictions after any unconstitutional provisions are stricken. The mayor and council declare that they would have enacted the remaining parts of this chapter if they had known that such portion thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The mayor and council declare their intent that should this chapter be declared invalid in part or in whole, signs are to be subject to regulations applicable to structures contained in other ordinances, including the zoning resolution.
