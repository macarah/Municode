ARTICLE VII. - PURCHASING
DIVISION - 1.
PROCUREMENT AND SELECTION PROCEDURES

Sec. 2-330. - Purpose.
To establish procurement and selection procedures to purchase and contract for property, supplies, furnishings, equipment, labor, materials and services in an proper, efficient and economical manner, in compliance with applicable City of Cedartown (hereinafter referred to as the "city"), State of Georgia and federal laws and regulations.
( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A, 11-13-17)
Sec. 2-331. - Scope.
All property, supplies, furnishings, equipment, labor, materials, services and other similar items, purchased in whole or in part by the city, shall be acquired in accordance with these procedures.
( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.1, 11-13-17)
Sec. 2-332. - Compliance with applicable legislation.
All procurements and contracts will be carried out in compliance with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations and procedures including, but not limited to, the:
(1)
Georgia House Bill 1079; Public Works, hereinafter referred to as the "Public Works Bid Law," which provides requirements for bonding, advertising and contract award for public works projects.
(2)
Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments or the Common Rule, as adopted by the DCA, which describes: bonding and insurance requirements, methods to use to obtain goods and services, record retention requirements, standards for financial management systems and monitoring and reporting performance.
(3)
OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments, which establishes principles and standards for determining costs allowable to grants, contracts and other agreements with state and local governments.
Where conflicts exist, the most stringent applicable law or regulation shall be followed, whether local, state or federal.
Federal laws and standards will be applicable in cases where federal monies are involved with the procurement or contract. Federal procurement standards and guidelines are viewed as "in addition to, not to take the place of" local and state policies and procedures. State law is more restrictive in some cases and therefore prevails. If local standards are more restrictive, then they prevail.
( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.2, 11-13-17)
Sec. 2-333. - Procurement procedures.
All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner that provides maximum free and open competition.
(1)
Solicitations of offer will:
a.
Contain a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
b.
Clearly state all requirements bidders must fulfill such as adequate licensing, as well as the factors used to evaluate bids or proposals.
(2)
Quoted prices of vendors and suppliers will remain confidential until all quotes are received and the selection made, purchase order issued or all quotes rejected. The quote of one person will not be used to negotiate a lower quote from another.
(3)
Awards will be made only to responsible contractors that possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement.
(4)
All other factors being equal, the city should accept the quote of the lowest responsible proposer, but may reject any and all quotes or bids.
(5)
Reasonable attempts will be made to utilize small, minority and local businesses. Local vendor preference applies to all informal and formal procurements greater than $10,000.00 excluding construction projects; professional and consulting services, federally funded projects; and online/electronic sealed bid/reverse auctions. A local vendor's bid will be awarded if the bid is within two percent of the non-local vendor's bid who otherwise would have received the award of the contract.
(6)
No purchase or contract shall be divided into parts for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of the competitive bid law or the public works law. Any such partial contract shall be void.
( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.3, 11-13-17)
Sec. 2-334. - Methods of procurement.
All procurements shall be carried out in compliance with one of the following four methods of procurement described below.
(1)
Small purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are relatively simple and informal procurement methods that are sound and appropriate for the procurement of relatively small quantities of equipment, materials, supplies or other property. In accordance with the requirements of the competitive bid law, small purchase procedures may be utilized for such purchases costing in the aggregate less than $10,000.00.
In accordance with the public works bid law, public works construction contracts of less than $100,000.00 may be let through the use of small purchase procedures without the need for sealed bids.
Small purchase procedures may also be utilized for the procurement of professional services.
When utilizing small purchase procedures, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources and, wherever possible, no less than three. Appropriate documentation of all small purchase procedures shall be maintained as required.
The lowest responsible proposer shall be selected, except in cases when documented exceptions may be granted with the approval of the city manager or chief financial officer.
Purchases less than the competitive bid law limit ($10,000.00), will be made in compliance with small purchase procedures. Competitive sealed bids may be used for smaller procurements if determined to be in the best interest of the city. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the city manager, for those purchases excluded from the competitive bid law requirements, when one of the following circumstances can be properly documented to substantiate the decision:
a.
Items where the purchase price has been set by the federal government or the State of Georgia (e.g., state bid list);
b.
Requirements to maintain a degree of continuity with the original or existing décor, equipment, or programs, where an attempt to quote could result in operational or functional inconsistency;
c.
When a quote attempt results in no response, orders will be placed with the first reliable source with suitable price, quality and delivery;
d.
When lowest or best price has been previously determined by historical purchases; or
e.
When the purchasing officer determines that three quotes cannot feasibly be obtained.
(2)
Competitive sealed bids. In accordance with the requirements of the competitive bid law, competitive sealed bids shall be taken on contracts for all labor, services, or work, or for the purchase or lease of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property involving $10,000.00 or more. Procurements of professional services are exempt from the competitive bid law.
In accordance with the requirements of the public works law, competitive sealed bids must be utilized for public works construction projects totaling $100,000.00 or more.
Sealed bids shall be publicly solicited through formal advertising. To be feasible to use competitive sealed bids, the following conditions must be present:
a.
A complete, adequate and realistic specification or description of the purchase is available;
b.
Two or more responsible vendors are willing and able to effectively compete for the business; and
c.
The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed-price contract that allows selection of the successful bidder based principally on price. Cost plus a percentage of the cost is not allowed.
Procurements utilizing competitive sealed bids shall comply with the following:
a.
Sufficient time must be allowed between bid solicitation and the date set for opening of bids.
b.
Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers. The invitation for bids must be publicly advertised (i.e., published at least once in The Cedartown Standard) or in accordance with applicable state law.
c.
The invitation for bids, including specifications and pertinent attachments, must clearly define the items or services needed to allow the bidders to properly respond.
d.
All bids must be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for bids.
e.
A firm fixed-price contract award shall be made by written notice to the lowest responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the invitation for bids. If specified in the bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation costs and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts may only be used to determine low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are generally taken.
f.
Any or all bids may be rejected when there are sound documented business reasons in the best interest of the city.
(3)
Competitive negotiation. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. Either a fixed-price or a cost-reimbursable type contract may be awarded, as appropriate. If competitive negotiation procedures are utilized, the following requirements apply:
a.
Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources to permit reasonable competition. The request for proposals must be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete must be honored to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
The request for proposals shall identify all significant evaluation factors and their relative importance.
c.
Mechanisms for technical evaluation of the proposals received, determinations of responsible vendors for the purpose of written or oral discussions and selection criteria for contract award, shall be provided.
d.
Award may be made to the responsible offerer whose proposal will be most advantageous to the city, all factors considered. Unsuccessful offerers should be notified promptly.
Competitive negotiation procedures may be used for procurement of professional services. When utilizing competitive negotiation procedures for procurement of professional services, competitor's qualifications shall be evaluated and selection shall be subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation for qualified competitors.
(4)
Noncompetitive negotiation. Noncompetitive negotiation or "sole source" procurement is limited to the following situations:
a.
The item or service is available from only one source.
b.
Urgent public need or emergency will not allow for a delay caused by advertising.
c.
After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate or only one response is received.
Contracts awarded utilizing Noncompetitive Negotiation procedures shall be made with responsible contractors or venders who are able to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement document. Consideration shall be given to contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and other technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
When using the noncompetitive negotiation method of procurement, ensure that:
a.
Proper documentation that one or more of the above circumstances existed;
b.
There is no conflict of interest by the parties involved; and
c.
Costs for the service(s) are clearly in line with applicable local, regional and/or state approved ranges or other acceptable industry standards.
