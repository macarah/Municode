Variances. The city council is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the dimensional requirements of zoning regulations (any provisions requiring a number to be achieved, such as height in feet, setback, lot area, lot width, parking and loading requirements, etc.) as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will in an individual case result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
