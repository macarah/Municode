Chapter 37 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 37-1—37-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION

Sec. 37-31. - Purpose.
The City of Madison is dedicated to providing a healthy, safe working environment. In meeting these goals, it is our policy to: (1) assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive, and healthy manner; (2) create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse; (3) prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances; and (4) encourage employees to seek professional assistance when alcohol or drug dependency adversely affects performance of assigned duties.
The purpose of this article is to assure worker fitness for duty and to protect our employees and the public from the risks posed by the misuse of alcohol and use of prohibited drugs. This article is also intended to comply with all applicable Federal [laws].
Regulations governing workplace anti-drug and alcohol programs in the transit industry. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has published 49 CFR Part 655, as amended, that mandates urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions and prohibits performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has also published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens. In addition, the Federal government published 49 CFR Part 29, "The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988," which requires the establishment of drug-free workplace policies and the reporting of certain drug-related offenses to the FTA. This article incorporates those requirements for employees performing safety-sensitive functions.

(2)
An individual suffers a bodily injury and immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or
(3)
One or more vehicles incur disabling damage as the result of the occurrence and is/are transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. For purposes of this definition, "disabling damage" means damage which precludes departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual manner in daylight after simple repairs. Disabling damage includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated but would have been further damaged if so operated, but does not include damage which can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the occurrence without special tools or parts, tire disablement without other damage even if no spare tire is available, or damage to headlights, taillights, turn signals, horn, mirrors or windshield wipers that makes them inoperative.

Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols contained in any beverage, mixture, mouthwash, candy, food, preparation or medication. Expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by an evidential breath testing device.
Aliquot means a fractional part of a specimen used for testing alcohol concentration; it is taken as a sample representing the whole specimen.
Canceled test means a drug test that has been declared invalid by a medical review officer. A canceled test is neither positive nor negative.
Confirmatory drug test means a second analytical procedure to identify the presence of a specific drug or metabolite which is independent of the initial test and which uses a different technique and chemical principle from that of the initial in order to ensure reliability and accuracy.
Confirmatory validity test means a second test performed on a different aliquot of the original urine specimen to further support a validity test result.
Covered employee means an employee who performs a safety-sensitive function, including an applicant or transferee who is being considered for hire into a safety-sensitive function (See Attachment A for a list of covered employees), and other employees, applicants, or transferee that will not perform a safety-sensitive function but fall under the ordinance of the company's own authority.

Medical review officer (MRO) means a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) responsible for receiving laboratory results generated by the drug testing program who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's confirmed positive test result, together with his/her medical history, and any other relevant bio-medical information.
Negative dilute means a drug test result which is negative for the five drug/drug metabolites but has a specific gravity value lower than expected for human urine.
Negative test result means the verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite below the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 BAC is a negative test result.
Non-negative test result means a urine specimen that is reported as adulterated, substitute, invalid, or positive for drug/drug metabolites.
Oxidizing adulterant means a substance that acts alone or in combination with other substances to oxidize drugs or drug metabolites to prevent the detection of the drug or metabolites or affects the reagents in either the initial or confirmatory drug test.
Performing (a safety-sensitive function) means a covered employee is considered to be performing a safety-sensitive function and includes any period in which he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately available to perform such functions.
Positive test result means a verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite at or above the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. A positive alcohol test result means a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 BAC or greater.

All supervisory personnel who are in a position to determine employee fitness for duty will receive 60 minutes of reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use and 60 minutes of additional reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse. Under the City of Madison's own authority, supervisory personnel will also be trained on how to intervene constructively and how to effectively integrate an employee back into his/her work group following intervention and/or treatment. Information on the signs, symptoms, health effects, and consequences of alcohol misuse is presented in Attachment B of this chapter.
(Amd. of 2-25-08(3), § 1(Exh. A); Amd. of 11-24-08(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Editor's note— Attachment B is not set out herein, but is on file in the offices of the city.
Sec. 37-34. - Prohibited substances.
"Prohibited substances" addressed by this article include the following:
(1)
Illegally used controlled substances or drugs. The use of any illegal drug or any substance identified in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), as further defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15, is prohibited at all times, unless a legal prescription has been written for the substance. This includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and cocaine, as well as any drug not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legal prescribed drugs, and use of illegally obtained prescription drugs. The medical use of marijuana, or the use of hemp related products, those which cause drug or drug metabolites to be present in the body above the minimum thresholds, is also a violation of this article. Federal Transit Administration drug testing regulations (49 CFR Part 655) require that all covered employees be tested for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine as described in subsection 37-36(h) of this article. Illegal use of these five drugs is prohibited at all times and, thus, covered employees may be tested for these drugs anytime they are on duty.
(2)
Legal drugs. The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported by the covered employee to his/her supervisor. In addition, covered employees must obtain a written release from the attending physician releasing the person to perform their job duties anytime they obtain a performance altering prescription.
(3)
Alcohol. The use of beverages containing alcohol (including any mouthwash, medication, food, candy) or any other substances such that alcohol is present in the body while performing safety-sensitive job functions is prohibited. An alcohol test can be performed on a covered employee under 49 CFR Part 655 just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Under the City of Madison authority, an alcohol test can be performed anytime a covered employee is on duty.
(Amd. of 2-25-08(3), § 1(Exh. A); Amd. of 11-24-08(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 37-35. - Prohibited conduct.
(a)
Manufacture, trafficking, possession, and use. Covered employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of illegal drugs on city premises, in city vehicles, in uniform or while on city business. Covered employees who violate this provision will be subject to disciplinary action under the city personnel ordinance. Law enforcement shall be notified when criminal activity is reasonably suspected.
(b)
Intoxication/under the influence. Any covered employee who is reasonably suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited substance, or not fit for duty shall be temporarily suspended from safety-sensitive functions pending an investigation and verification of condition. Covered employees found to be under the influence of a prohibited substance or who fail to pass a drug or alcohol test shall be immediately removed from duty and be subject to disciplinary action. A drug or alcohol test is considered positive if the individual is found to have a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40.
(c)
Alcohol use and/or possession. No covered employee may report for duty or remain on duty when his/her ability to perform assigned safety-sensitive functions is adversely affected by alcohol or when his/her breath alcohol concentration is 0.4 or greater. No covered employee shall use or possess alcohol while performing safety-sensitive functions, or just before or just after performing a safety-sensitive function. Covered employees shall not use alcohol within four hours before reporting for duty, or during the hours they are on call. Violation of these provisions is prohibited and punishable by disciplinary action, pursuant to the city personnel ordinance.
(d)
Compliance with testing requirements. All covered employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing as a condition of employment. All testing shall be performed in compliance with all applicable federal requirements. Any covered employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be immediately removed from duty. Refusal includes failure to provide a sufficient urine specimen, saliva sample, or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a verbal declaration, obstructive behavior, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test.
The following are also considered a refusal to test if the employee:
(1)
Fails to appear for any test within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, after being directed to do so by the employer;
(2)
Fails to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete;
(3)
Fails to provide a urine or breath specimen for any drug test required by this part or DOT agency regulations;
(4)
In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of provision of a specimen;
(5)
Fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure;
(6)
Fails or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has required;
(7)
Fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" or "shy lung" procedures;
(8)
Fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process);
(9)
MRO reports that there is verified adulterated or substituted test result.
Drug tests can be performed anytime a safety-sensitive employee is on duty. An alcohol test can be performed when the safety-sensitive employee is actually performing a safety-sensitive duty, just before, or just after the performance of a safety-sensitive duty.
Any covered employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results will be required to undergo an observed collection. Any of the above violations will be cause for immediate removal from duty, and shall also be cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel ordinance.
(e)
Treatment requirements. All employees shall use the available resources for treatment of alcohol misuse and drug abuse problems. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid by the employees or their insurance provider. Employees who make self-referrals (i.e., no management intervention or positive test results) will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program. Employees that test positive will be referred to the substance abuse professional designated by the city for assessment. Treatment is required for those who test positive. Any treatment obtained shall be paid for by the employee or their insurer.
(f)
Notice of criminal drug conviction. All covered employees must notify the city system of any criminal drug conviction. The notice must be given in writing within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall be cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel ordinance.
(g)
Proper application of the ordinance. The city is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this article. Therefore, all aspects of this article shall be enforced in an unbiased and impartial manner, and in compliance with all applicable federal regulations.
(Amd. of 2-25-08(3), § 1(Exh. A); Amd. of 11-24-08(2), § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 37-36. - Testing procedures.
(a)
Alcohol and drug testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment, and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS). All testing will be conducted per 49 CFR Part 40. The city recognizes its employees' privacy rights, and testing will be done per privacy requirements. Immediately prior to testing, employees shall be told the test is required by federal regulations.
(b)
The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. Urine specimens will be collected using the split specimen collection method described in 49 CFR Part 40. Each specimen will be accompanied by a DOT Chain of Custody and Control Form and identified using a unique identification number that attributes the specimen to the correct individual. An initial drug screen will be conducted on the primary urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, appear to be substitute, or adulterated, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds in 49 CFR Part 40. Attachment C lists the minimum thresholds for each drug and/or its metabolites.
The test results from the laboratory will be reported to a medical review officer. A medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with detailed knowledge of substance abuse disorders and drug testing. The MRO will review the test results to ensure the scientific validity of the test and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result, substitution or adulteration. The MRO will contact the employee; notify the employee of the positive, substitute, or adulterated laboratory result; and provide the employee with an opportunity to explain the confirmed test result. The MRO will subsequently review the employee's medical history/medical records to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a positive, substitute or adulterated laboratory result. If no legitimate medical explanation is found, the test will be verified positive, substitute, or adulterated and reported to the company program manager. If a legitimate explanation is found, the MRO will report the test result as negative.
The split specimen will be stored at the initial laboratory until the analysis of the primary specimen is completed. If the primary specimen is negative, the split will be discarded. If the primary is positive, the split will be retained for testing if so requested by the employee through the medical review officer.
(c)
Observed collections.
(1)
Consistent with 49 CFR part 40, collection under direct observation (by a person of the same gender) with no advance notice will occur if:
a.
The laboratory reports to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reports to program manager that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result; or
b.
The MRO reports to program manager that the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed.
(2)
The program manager may direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty test or a follow-up test.
(3)
The collector must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if:
a.
The collector is directed by the program manager to do so; or
b.
The collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen; or
c.
The temperature on the original specimen was out of range; or
d.
The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
(d)
Employee requested testing. Any covered employee who questions the results of a drug test my request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. The split sample testing will occur regardless of up-front payment, but the city reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the employee. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with 49 CFR Part 40. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee.
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen. For those specimens that are positive, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds in 49 CFR Part 40.
(e)
Alcohol testing procedures.
(1)
Tests for breath alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-approved Evidential Breath Testing device (EBT) operated by a trained Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT). Alcohol screening tests may be performed using a non-evidential testing device which is also approved by NHSTA. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test must occur on an EBT. The confirmatory test will be conducted at least 15 minutes after the completion of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using a NHTSA-approved EBT operated by a trained BAT. The EBT will identify each test by a unique sequential identification number. This number, time, and unit identifier will be provided on each EBT printout. The EBT printout, along with an approved alcohol testing form, will be used to document the test, the subsequent results, and to attribute the test to the correct employee. The test will be performed in a private, confidential manner per 49 CFR Part 40. The procedure will be followed as prescribed, to protect the employee and to maintain the integrity of the alcohol testing procedures and validity of the test result.
(2)
An employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of this article. The consequences of a positive alcohol test are described in this article. Even though an employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 is not considered positive, the employee shall still be removed from duty for at least 24 hours, or for the duration of the work day, whichever is longer and will be subject to the consequences described in this article. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 will be considered a negative test.
(3)
The city affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process. If at any time the integrity of the testing procedures or the validity of the test results is compromised, the test will be canceled. Minor inconsistencies or procedural flaws that do not impact the test result will not result in a cancelled test.
(4)
The alcohol testing form (ATF) required by 49 CFR Part 40 as amended, shall be used for all FTA required testing. Failure of an employee to sign step 2 of the ATF will be considered a refusal to submit to testing.
(f)
Tests for breath alcohol concentration. These will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 to .039, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using a NHTSA-approved evidential breath testing device (EBT) operated by a trained breath alcohol technician (BAT). A covered employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her position for 24 hours, unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater is a positive alcohol test and in violation of this article and the requirements in 49 CFR Part 655 for covered employees.
(g)
Removal from safety-sensitive function. Any covered employee that has a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test will be immediately removed from any safety-sensitive function, informed of educational and rehabilitation programs available, and referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP) for assessment. A positive drug and/or alcohol test is cause for disciplinary action pursuant to the city personnel ordinance.
(h)
Pre-employment testing. All covered employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breathe alcohol testing as a condition of employment. All testing shall be performed in compliance with all applicable federal requirements. If the test is canceled, the employee must reschedule, take and pass the test before being hired. Any covered employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be immediately removed from duty. Refusal includes failure to provide a sufficient urine specimen, saliva sample, or breathe sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a verbal declaration, obstructive behavior, dilution of a specimen, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test. When the laboratory reports that a specimen is negative dilute, an immediate re-collection is required. Should the second test be negative dilute, no additional testing is required, and it is considered a negative test result. Any of the above violations will be cause for immediate removal from duty, and also disciplinary action per the city personnel policies. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of 120 days. A substance abuse professional's certification of the absence of drug dependency that meets with the approval of the city, and negative pre-employment drug tests, will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
In addition, FTA requires all safety-sensitive employees, who have been off duty for 90 or more days for any reason, to successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of a safety-sensitive function. A pre-employment/pre-transfer test will also be performed anytime an employee's status changes from an inactive status in a safety-sensitive position to an active status in a safety-sensitive position (i.e., return from Worker's Comp., return from leave of absence).
(i)
Reasonable suspicion testing. All city covered employees may be subject to urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to suspect drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A determination of reasonable suspicion for drug or alcohol testing must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations of appearance, speech, behavior and/or odors of the covered employee. Further evidence of reasonable suspicion includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(1)
Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use or alcohol misuse.
(2)
Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substances.
(3)
Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused by prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse.
(4)
Fights, assaults, and violations of established safety, security, or other operating procedures.
Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made in writing by a supervisor who has received at least 60 minutes training to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use, and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited drug or alcohol use. Alcohol testing must be done just before, during or just after a covered employee's performance of a safety-sensitive function, and must be accomplished within eight hours of a reasonable suspicion determination. If testing is not done within eight hours, test attempts shall cease, and a written report explaining the failure to test shall be made. Drug testing may be done anytime a covered employee is on duty.
(j)
Post-accident testing. All covered employees must undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident while performing a safety-sensitive function. Covered employees whose performance could have contributed to the accident must be tested. A post-accident test will be conducted unless the employee's actions can be completely ruled out as a contributing factor to the accident. Following an accident, the covered employees will be tested as soon as possible, but no later than eight hours after the accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours after the accident for drug testing. After such times have elapsed, no further testing shall be attempted and the reasons for any failures to test shall be recorded. Any covered employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight hours following the accident or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test. Any safety-sensitive employee who leaves the scene of the accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing will be considered to have refused the test and shall be subject to discipline under the city personnel ordinance.
As soon as practicable following an accident involving the loss of human life, The city shall conduct drug and alcohol test on each surviving covered employee operating the mass-transit vehicle at the time of the accident. Post accident drug and alcohol testing of the operator is not required under this section if the covered employee is tested under the fatal accident testing requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration rule 49 CFR 389.303(a)(1) or (b)(1).
The city shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision.
As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the loss of human life in which the mass-transit vehicle is involved, the city shall drug and alcohol test each covered employee operating the mass-transit vehicle at the time of the accident unless the employer determines, using the best information available at the time of the decision, that the covered employee's performance can be completely ruled out as a contributing factor to the accident. The employer shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision.
If an alcohol test is required by this section is not administered within two hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reason the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within eight hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and maintain and record of why the test was not administered. Records shall be submitted to FTA upon request of the administrator.
(k)
Random testing.
(1)
All covered employees will be subject to random, unannounced testing. The selection of employees shall be made by a scientifically valid method of randomly generating an employee identifier from the appropriate pool of safety-sensitive employees.
(2)
The dates for administering unannounced testing of randomly selected employees shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year, day of the week and hours of the day.
(3)
The number of employees randomly selected for drug/alcohol testing during the calendar year shall be not less than the percentage rates established by federal regulations for those safety-sensitive employees subject to random testing by federal regulations. The current random testing rate for drugs established by FTA equals 25 percent of the number of covered employees in the pool and random testing rate for alcohol established by FTA equals ten percent of the number of covered employees in the pool.
(4)
Each covered employee shall be in a pool from which the random selection is made. Each covered employee in the pool shall have an equal chance of selection each time the selections are made. Employees will remain in the pool and be subject to selection, whether or not the employee has been previously tested. There is no discretion on the part of management in the selection.
(5)
Covered transit employees that fall under the federal transit administration regulations will be included in one random pool maintained separately from the testing pool of employees that are included solely under the city's authority.
(6)
Random tests can be conducted at any time during an employee's shift for drug testing. Alcohol random tests can be performed just before, during, or just after the performance of a safety-sensitive duty. However, under the city's authority, a random alcohol test may be performed anytime the covered employee is on duty. Testing can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of an employee's shift.
(7)
Employees are required to proceed immediately to the collection site upon notification of their random selection.
(l)
Return to duty and follow-up testing. A negative drug and alcohol test is a requirement for return to duty. All covered employees who have returned to duty after removal for alcohol or drug use will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced random urine and/or breath testing. The testing will be performed for a period of five years, with a minimum of six tests to be performed the first year. Such testing shall also be performed after a substance abuse professional determines a covered employee needs help resolving drug or alcohol problems. Random alcohol tests may be conducted just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive functions. Random drug tests may be conducted anytime a covered employee is on duty. Random alcohol and drug tests may be conducted anytime a covered employee is on duty.
(m)
Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results of a required drug test may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on a split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. All cost for such testing is paid by the employee unless the result of the split sample test invalidates the results of the original test.
The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be in compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. The medical review officer (MRO) is Dr. Miguel Cossio, 1075 South Main St., Madison, Georgia 30650, (706) 342-0449; the drug testing for all DOT employees will be preformed by Morgan Memorial Hospital, 1077 South Main Street, Madison, Georgia 30650; the drug testing of samples for all DOT employees will be performed by Quest Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia (770-452-1590).

Sec. 37-37. - Professional evaluation.
Any covered employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol above the minimum thresholds set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, will be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse professional (SAP). A SAP is a licensed or certified physician, psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-related disorders. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse. Evaluation by a SAP or participation in the city's employee assistance program does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement with the city.
If a covered employee is allowed to return to duty, he/she must first properly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP and have negative return-to-duty drug and alcohol tests. Thereafter, the employee shall be subject to unannounced follow-up testing for a period of one to five years. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or employee's insurance provider. Employees will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program.
