The speed limit within any school zone as provided for in O.C.G.A. § 40-14-8 and marked pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-6 may be enforced by using photographically recorded images for violations which occurred only on a school day during the time in which instructional classes are taking place and one (1) hour before such classes are scheduled to begin and for one (1) hour after such classes have concluded when such violations are in excess of ten (10) miles per hour over the speed limit.
( Ord. No. 2020-01 , § 1, 2-18-20)
Sec. 14-155. - Administration.
(a)
The city, or agent on behalf of the city, in connection with operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device provided for by O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18, shall maintain a log for the automated traffic enforcement safety device attesting to the performance of such device's self-test at least once every thirty (30) days and the results of such self-test pertaining to the accuracy of the automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such log shall be admissible in any civil enforcement proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18. The city, or agent on behalf of the city, operating an automated traffic enforcement safety device shall perform an independent calibration test on the automated traffic enforcement safety device at least once every twelve (12) months. The results of such calibration test shall be admissible in any court proceeding for a violation issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18.
(b)
Prior to the placement of a device within a school zone, each school within whose school zone such automated traffic enforcement safety device is to be placed shall first apply for and secure a permit from the department of transportation for the use of uch automated traffic enforcement safety device. Such permit shall be awarded based upon need and pursuant to any rules and regulations promulgated by the department of transportation.
(c)
If an automated traffic enforcement safety device is moved to or placed in a location where an automated traffic enforcement safety device has not previously been moved to or placed in, no citation shall be issued for a violation recorded by that automated traffic enforcement safety device until:
(1)
The city shall erect signs warning of the use of a stationary speed detective device within the approaching school zone. Such signs shall be at least twenty-four (24) by thirty (30) inches in area, shall be visible plainly from every lane of traffic, shall be viewable in all traffic conditions, and shall not be placed in such a manner that the view of such sign is subject to being obstructed by any other vehicle on such highway. Such signs shall be placed within five hundred (500) feet prior to the warning sign announcing the reduction of the speed limit for the school speed zone. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such signs are properly installed pursuant to this subsection at the time of any alleged violation under this article; and
(2)
That no citation shall be issued for the first thirty (30) days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by the city within a school zone, but rather, a civil warning shall be issued for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
(d)
The city, or its agent, shall send by first class mail addressed to the owner of the motor vehicle within thirty (30) days after obtaining the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle but no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the alleged violation:
(1)
A citation for the alleged violation, which shall include the date and time of the violation, the location of the infraction, the maximum speed at which such motor vehicle was traveling in photographically recorded images, the maximum speed applicable within such school zone, the civil warning or the amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed, and the date by which a civil monetary penalty shall be paid;
(2)
An image taken from the photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction;
(3)
A website address where photographically recorded images showing the vehicle involved in the infraction and a duplicate of the information provided for in this paragraph may be viewed;
(4)
A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified peace officer employed by the city and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, the owner's motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law;
(5)
A statement of the inference provided by Georgia law and of the means specified therein by which such inference may be rebutted for such violation;
(6)
Information advising the owner of the motor vehicle of the manner in which liability as alleged in the citation may be contested through an administrative hearing; and
(7)
A warning that the failure to pay the civil monetary penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner as provided for in this article and as required by O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18(d) shall waive any right to contest liability.
(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images. A copy of a certificate sworn to or affirmed by a certified police officer employed by the city and stating that, based upon inspection of photographically recorded images, a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit in the marked school zone and that such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law, shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
(f)
Liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this article was operated in violation of the speed limit of the school zone, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized statement that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or
(2)
Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(g)
A violation for which a civil warning or a civil monetary penalty is imposed pursuant to this article shall not be considered a moving traffic violation for the purpose of points assessment pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-5-57. Such violation shall be deemed noncriminal, and imposition of a civil warning or civil monetary penalty pursuant to this article shall not be deemed a conviction and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it be used for any insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
(h)
If a person issued and mailed a citation pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section fails to pay the civil monetary penalty for the violation or has not filed a police report or notarized statement pursuant to subsection (f) of this section in no less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the city, the agent or the city shall send to such person by first class mail a second notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty, except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The second notice shall include all information in subsection (d) of this section and shall include a new date of return which shall be no less than thirty (30) days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the city. If such person notified by second notice again fails to pay the civil monetary penalty or file a police report or notarized statement pursuant to subsection (f) of this section by the new date of return, such person shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for the civil monetary penalty provided for under section 14-156 of this article, except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. Notices mailed by first class mail pursuant to this section shall be adequate notification of the fees and penalties imposed by section 14-156 of this article. No other notice shall be required for the purposes of this article.
(i)
Any court having jurisdiction over violations of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18(a), which shall include the Municipal Court of the City of Union City, shall have jurisdiction over cases arising under this article and shall be authorized to impose the civil monetary penalty provided for by this article. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Georgia law, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure, defenses, adjudication, appeal and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise applicable to violations under this article shall apply to enforcement under this article; provided, however, that any appeal from superior or state court shall be by application in the same manner as that provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-6-35.
( Ord. No. 2020-01 , § 1, 2-18-20)
Sec. 14-156. - Monetary penalty.
The owner of a motor vehicle shall be liable for a civil monetary penalty to the city if such vehicle is found, as evidenced by photographically recorded images, to have been operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within any school zone and such disregard or disobedience was not otherwise authorized by law. The amount of such civil monetary penalty shall be seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for a first violation and one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) for a second or any subsequent violation, in addition to fees associated with the electronic processing of such civil monetary penalty which shall not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00); provided, however, that for a period of thirty (30) days after the first automated traffic enforcement safety device is introduced by the city within a school zone, the driver of a motor vehicle shall not be liable for a civil monetary penalty but shall be issued a civil warning for disregard or disobedience of the speed limit within the school zone.
( Ord. No. 2020-01 , § 1, 2-18-20)
Sec. 14-157. - Final notification of monetary penalty.
If a violation has not been contested and the assessed penalty has not been paid, the agent or city shall send to the person who is the registered owner of the motor vehicle a final notice of any unpaid civil monetary penalty authorized by this article, except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. The notice shall inform the registered owner that the agent or city shall send a referral to the Department of Revenue if the assessed penalty is not paid within thirty (30) days after the final notice was mailed and such referral shall result in the nonrenewal of the registration of such motor vehicle and shall prohibit the title transfer of such motor vehicle within this state.
( Ord. No. 2020-01 , § 1, 2-18-20)
Sec. 14-158. - Referral to Department of Revenue.
The agent or city shall send a referral to the Department of Revenue not sooner than thirty (30) days after the final notice required under section 14-157 was mailed if a violation under this article has not been contested and the assessed penalty has not been paid. The referral to the Department of Revenue shall include the following:
(1)
Any information known or available to the agent or city concerning the license plate number, year or registration, and the name of the owner of the motor vehicle;
(2)
The date on which the violation occurred;
(3)
The date when the notice required under this article was mailed; and
(4)
The seal, logo, emblem or electronic seal of the city.
( Ord. No. 2020-01 , § 1, 2-18-20)
Sec. 14-159. - Arrest or citation for same violation.
A civil warning or civil monetary penalty under this article on the owner of a motor vehicle shall not be imposed if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or issued a citation and notice to appear by a certified police officer for the same violation.

Sec. 14-160. - Incorporation of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18.
