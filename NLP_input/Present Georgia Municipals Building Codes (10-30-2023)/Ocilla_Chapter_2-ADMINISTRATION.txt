Preamble.
(1)
As trustees for the citizens of the City, the Mayor and Council pledge to govern their conduct by the following principles:
a.
Serve others, not themselves;
b.
Use resources with efficiency and economy;
c.
Treat all people fairly;
d.
Use the power of their position for the well-being of their constituents;
e.
Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity.
(2)
The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed.
(3)
All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amendable to them. See Ga. Const. art. I, sec. II, ¶ I.
(4)
The people of the State have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it.
(5)
The people have a right to expect that every public official will display conduct in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government the official represents.
(6)
Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:
a.
Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness, and equality under the law; and
b.
Avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.
(b)
Purpose; declaration of policy.
(1)
It is the policy of the City that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a Code of Ethics for all City officials is adopted. This Code has the following purposes:
a.
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by City officials;
b.
To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the City;
c.
To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in manners affecting the City; and
d.
To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaign.
