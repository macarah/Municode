ARTICLE 4-4-26 - ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURAL GUIDE

4-4-26-010 - Policy.
A.
It is the position of the city/BLW that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include human costs such as lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses, deaths, as well as economic costs such as property damage, absenteeism, tardiness, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs, and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees.
B.
The use of alcohol or controlled substances by city/BLW employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others. The work involved in many positions is inherently dangerous, and the safety of citizens and employees depends upon the ability of fellow employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties.
C.
It is the objective of the city/BLW to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confronted and defeated. In order to achieve this, the city/BLW has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy. This policy consists of three interrelated programs:
1.
An employee education/supervisor training program;
2.
An employee referral system for assessment/treatment;
3.
An alcohol and controlled substance testing program.
The responsibility for this policy lies with the city/BLW department heads with the human resources department serving as expert advisor and training coordinator.
D.
The city/BLW considers its employees to be its most valuable resource and sincerely wishes to assist its employees with any alcohol or controlled substance related problems they might have. As used in this policy the term "controlled substance" shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as "controlled substances" in the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20 et seq., and especially O.C.G.A. § 16-12-21(4) as said section and said act shall appear from time to time.
(Code 1978, § 4-1161; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-015 - Definitions.
A.
Under the Influence. For the purpose of this policy, being "under the influence" means that the employee is affected by a drug(s) or alcohol or the combination of a drug and alcohol in any detectable manner exceeding the measurable benchmarks determined by the testing process authorized herein. The symptoms of influence are not confined to those consistent with misconduct, nor to any obvious impairment of physical or mental ability, such as slurred speech or difficulty in maintaining balance.
B.
Illegal Drug. "Illegal drug" means any drug (a) not legally obtainable or (b) legally obtainable but not legally obtained or used. The term includes prescription drugs obtained illegally and prescription drugs not being used for prescribed purposes including but not limited to those prescribed for other persons. "Controlled substances" mean those listed in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as further defined in regulation 21 CFR 1308.11-1308.15.
C.
Reasonable Suspicion. A belief based on observed, specific, objective facts where the rational inference to be drawn under the circumstances is that the person is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
D.
Safety Sensitive Positions/Duties. Any job that contains any duty regularly and routinely performed that is related to 1) the safe operation of city/BLW motorized equipment and vehicles, 2) the care, custody or interaction with children or the elderly in the course of their assigned responsibilities; and 3) any job or assigned task that involves the handling of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to medications, pesticides/herbicides, cleaning fluids, pool maintenance chemicals, etc. These tasks become safety sensitive during any period in which the city/BLW employee is actually performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform the above functions.
(Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 6)
4-4-26-020 - Prohibited acts.
A.
The use or possession of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises shall be prohibited.
B.
The sale, distribution or provision of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises shall be prohibited.
C.
Reporting to work, or working, while intoxicated or otherwise impaired by alcohol or controlled substance use shall be prohibited.
D.
Alcohol or controlled substance related off duty conduct that tends to undermine the reputation, authority or efficiency of the city/BLW is prohibited.
E.
The use or possession of prescription drugs while on work premises, or while working, shall be prohibited, unless;
1.
The prescribing physician has been notified of the duties involved with the employee's position and has approved the use of the drug while that employee is performing those duties. It is the duty of the employee to notify the physician of the specific tasks of the position and the mental and physical demands required in the performance of those duties. Further, the city/BLW reserves the right to clarify those duties and the mental and physical demands required to perform those tasks to the physician; and
2.
The employee's supervisor has been notified in writing by the employee that he is using a prescription drug and that the employee's physician has approved the use of the drug while the employee is at work. Identification of a physician authorized prescription drug to the supervisor is not required.
It should be noted that certain departments may have more restrictive regulation of prescription or over the counter medication than as provided herein. Employees are to be informed of such departmental policy upon initial orientation.
F.
Any employee convicted of violating a criminal drug statute must inform his department head of such conviction (including pleas of guilty and nolo contendere) within five days of the conviction occurring. Failure to so inform the employer subjects the employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination for the first offense. By law, the city/BLW must notify any federal contracting officer within ten days of receiving such notice from an employee or other receiving notice of such a conviction.
G.
The adulteration of any sample provided or disruption of any city/BLW authorized drug/alcohol testing process shall be prohibited.
(Code 1978, § 4-1162; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 7)
4-4-26-030 - Alcohol or controlled substance testing.
Individuals shall submit to alcohol and/or controlled substance testing at the following times:
A.
At a time set by the human resources department during the final selection process prior to the actual commencement of employment or promotion or transfer or voluntary demotion for designated safety sensitive positions with the city/BLW or any other position with the city/BLW not prohibited by law.
B.
As a part of any required physical examination.
C.
When, in the opinion of any supervisory or management employee there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee of the city/BLW has violated any provision of the alcohol and controlled substance policy dealing with the use of alcohol or any controlled substance.
D.
When involved in an accident which results in property damage or personal injury involving city/BLW equipment or while on duty, on standby duty or in the process of reporting to or leaving work.
E.
As part of the random testing program for all employees who:
1.
Perform safety sensitive functions [see Subsection 4-4-26-015(D) above] which shall include but is not limited to those employees who regularly drive a city/BLW vehicle as part of their required duties of their position; or
2.
Are required by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 49 CFR, Part 382, to maintain a commercial driver's license.
F.
If the employee is returned to regular duty after violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy and follow-up testing for employees after such violation, employees will be, at a minimum, subject to 18 unannounced tests over a 36-month period. The time period and tests may be extended at the discretion of the human resources director.
The city/BLW may test for the following substances and for any other substance as may be deemed an illegal and/or controlled substance or that may be required by federal, state law or regulation. This list is provided for information only and is not in any way intended to limit the scope of testing for illegal and/or controlled substances:
1.
Alcohol.
2.
Hallucinogens.
3.
Amphetamines/methamphetamines.
4.
Marijuana (THC).
5.
Barbiturates.
6.
Methadone.
7.
Benzodiazepines.
8.
Opiate derivatives (example: Oxycontin or oxy derivatives, heroin, morphine, codeine).
9.
Cocaine metabolites.
10.
Phencyclidine (PCP).
11.
MDMA (Ecstasy).
The city/BLW specifically authorizes the human resources director to periodically review the foregoing list and to add additional illegal and/or controlled substances to the testing list with or without notice to the employee.
(Code 1978, § 4-1163; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6905, 4/12/2006, § 1; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 8; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-040 - Procedural guide for violations.
If in the opinion of the supervisor, a reasonable suspicion exists that the employee is reporting to work, or is working, while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, or while impaired from the use of same, the procedures outlined below shall be followed. Please note that for the purposes of this policy the term "reasonable suspicion" shall be based on objective indications of substance abuse.
A.
Procedures for Impairment Violations.
1.
The supervisor shall arrange, if possible, for at least one other supervisor to observe the conduct of the employee. The observing supervisor shall make a written report of the incident, including the "supervisor's observation checklists" form which includes a description of the conduct of the employee upon which such reasonable suspicion is based.
2.
If the employee fails to explain his condition to the satisfaction of the employee's supervisor, an alcohol and/or controlled substance screening test shall be administered to the suspected employee. The employee will be driven by the supervisor or other designated official to the city designated testing facility. Refusal to submit to such tests shall constitute insubordination and shall be a sufficient ground for termination. The employee will be suspended with pay pending the results of the alcohol and/or controlled substance screening test. Tests for alcohol impairment may be administered by the use of the device known as Intox 5000 or any other similar device approved for use by the director of the state crime lab.
3.
The supervisor should make the necessary arrangements to have the employee taken home. If the employee refuses any assistance, at least two supervisory personnel can verify that the employee refused such assistance. However, if an employee cannot control his actions and refuses assistance, then the police department shall be called to warn them of the employee's condition and refusal of assistance before the employee is allowed to leave the work site. The police department shall be given the employee's name and description of the employee's car. The reason for this action is for the safety of the employee and the general public. The city/BLW has a duty to take such action as a reasonably prudent employer to prevent the employee from causing an unreasonable risk of harm to himself and others.
4.
If the confirmed results of such tests indicate the presence of alcohol or any illegal controlled substance in the system of the employee, it will be presumed that the employee is impaired. The presumption of impairment will result in the suspension with pay pending discharge investigation of the employee pursuant to procedures set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations.
5.
During the period the employee is suspended with pay, an investigation shall take place. This investigation will be completed within five eight-hour work days (Saturday, Sunday and holidays excluded) unless extended by the human resources director. During this investigation, the employee may through his own effort attempt to rebut the presumption of impairment. For example, the employee may submit to a blood test within three hours of the city/BLW-administered test for the presence of alcohol or controlled substances. If such blood test produces a negative result, the presumption of impairment may be considered rebutted, depending upon such factors as the timing of the blood test and other circumstances surrounding the impairment.
6.
If after the investigation is completed, and if it has been determined that a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy has occurred, it shall be within the discretion of the supervisory personnel to:
a.
Discipline up to and including termination of the employee following the procedural guidelines set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations; or
b.
Coordinate with the human resources department to refer the employee for a rehabilitation assessment, at the city's expense to determine if there is a significant chance that the employee can be rehabilitated. This option is only available if the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public, himself or other employees or if he has not committed any felony or a misdemeanor related to his job or acts or omissions which could reasonably impact his ability to do his job effectively. The employee permitted to utilize this option will be required to sign an agreement accepting the conditions of the rehabilitation program in order to maintain an employment relationship with the city. Any conditions of the rehabilitation program must have been previously approved by the human resources director and the employee's department head. If such conditions are unacceptable to the employee, the provisions of Subsection (6)(a) shall apply. This referral would be the employee's "last chance." After successful completion of an alcohol and/or controlled substance program, at the employee's expense, the employee may return to work subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a minimum period of 36 months. If at any time during this "last chance" testing period, a screening test indicates the presence of alcohol or any controlled substance in the employee's system, the employee shall be immediately terminated after following the procedural guidelines set forth in the Disciplinary Action Policy and Procedure in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. Any subsequent relapse after 36 months will be handled as in Subsection (6)(a) above.
B.
Procedures for the Sale, Distribution or Provision of Alcohol/controlled Substances While at Work Violations. Violations of Section 4-4-26-020(b) will ordinarily result in termination consistent with the procedural guidelines set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations.
(Code 1978, § 4-1164; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 9; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-050 - Confidentiality.
At all times during an investigation of violations of the alcohol and controlled substances policy, reasonable steps will be taken to maintain the confidentiality of the case.
(Code 1978, § 4-1165; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
4-4-26-060 - Awareness program.
The basic idea behind this program is that employee alcohol/controlled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying employees with information about the problems alcohol/controlled substances can create. The awareness program is divided into two sections, an employee education section to include all city employees and a supervisory training section.
A.
Employee Education, Generally. The human resources department with assistance from the Marietta police and fire departments will provide educational seminars at least once annually. These seminars may include questionnaires at both the start and completion of the program (to chart any belief/knowledge changes); audiovisual programs; group discussions; a presentation of what a treatment program is, what it does, and how to take advantage of one; insurance coverage for treatment (if any); and a description and discussion of the city/BLW's alcohol and controlled substances policy.
B.
Employee Education for Holders of Commercial Drivers' Licenses. All new hires required to possess and maintain a commercial driver's license (CDL), and current employees transferring to positions requiring them to obtain a CDL, will be given a handbook entitled, "Drug Abuse and Alcohol Misuse Training Guide for CDL Drivers", which will include:
1.
The identity of the person designated to answer questions about the materials.
2.
The categories of drivers who are subject to the provisions of 49 CFR, Part 382.
3.
Sufficient information about safety sensitive functions performed by those drivers to make clear what period of the work day the driver is required to be in compliance.
4.
Specific information concerning driver conduct that is prohibited.
5.
The circumstances under which a driver will be tested for alcohol and/or controlled substances.
6.
The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of alcohol and controlled substances, protect the driver and the integrity of the testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct driver.
7.
The requirement that a driver submit to alcohol and controlled substances tests.
8.
An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an alcohol or controlled substances test.
9.
The consequence for drivers found to have an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater, but less than .04.
10.
Information concerning the effect of alcohol and controlled substances use on an individual's health, work and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substances problem; and available methods of intervening when an alcohol or controlled substances problem is suspected, including confrontation, referral programs and/or referral to management for disciplinary action.
C.
Supervisory Training. The human resources department with assistance from the Marietta police and fire departments will provide training to supervisors on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcohol/controlled substance abuse. The program may include instruction in identifying warning signs of alcohol/ controlled substance abuse by employees; role playing scenarios of what to do if an employee is suspected; group discussions; and a thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substances policy. Supervisory personnel designated to determine whether an employee should be required to submit to a controlled substance or alcohol reasonable suspicion test, shall receive an initial 60 minutes of training on controlled substance use, and 60 minutes of training on alcohol use, which will include the physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of probable use of controlled substances and alcohol.
D.
The city/BLW recognizes that alcohol/drug abuse and/or dependency are medical/behavioral conditions that can be successfully treated. Employees with alcohol/drug problems are encouraged to voluntarily request assistance from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Participation in an EAP is totally voluntary and completely confidential; however a request for assistance or actual participation in an EAP does not excuse an employee from violation of this policy. The only exception to the EAP confidentiality provision occurs when an employee is referred to the EAP by city/BLW authorized management personnel.
(Code 1978, § 4-1166; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 10; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-070 - Referral for rehabilitation.
A.
The alcohol and controlled substance policy allows a supervisor to refer an employee for assessment and rehabilitation as an option other than termination for a violation of this policy. However, this option is only available if the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public, himself or other employees or if he has not committed any felony or a misdemeanor related to his job or acts or omissions which could reasonably impact his ability to do his job effectively.
B.
All referrals will be coordinated through the city/BLW human resources department. Factors to take into account when this decision is made include:
1.
The employee's length of service;
2.
The employee's position and performance in that position prior to and during impairment;
3.
The severity of the policy violation;
4.
The publicity concerning the violation including the loss of credibility or believability of an employee who exercises discretionary judgment in the duties of his position;
5.
Whether the violation involved substance dependence or an incident(s) motivated by reasons other than substance dependence (for example, the sale of drugs to other employees).
C.
After a decision to refer the employee for rehabilitation has been made, the employee will be counseled by the department head and a representative of the human resources department. At this counseling session, the policy shall be reviewed with the employee, the employee shall sign the "employee consent and referral" form. It must be made clear to the employee at this time that the referral is his last chance, and that he must make the firm choice between rehabilitation or termination.
D.
If an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program, the absence will be treated as sick leave.
E.
Upon returning to work, the employee will be subject to unannounced alcohol/controlled substance screening tests for a minimum period of 36 months, with an emphasis on post-weekend (Mondays) testing or after vacations. However, a fixed schedule will not be established. Unless circumstances clearly require more frequent testing, there shall be no more than one screening test per month.
(Code 1978, § 4-1167; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 11; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-080 - Screening test program.
A.
Testing Quality and Techniques to be Utilized.
1.
The city/BLW will establish a professional relationship with a professional laboratory which shall comply with all current National Institute of Drug Abuse standards. An assessment of the laboratory will be performed which will include a review of how samples are actually tested; all procedures involved (chain of custody of sample, notation of time and place sample was taken, the amount of turn around time that will elapse before a result is reached, etc.); qualifications of the laboratory personnel; and a check of the internal quality control records of the laboratory.
2.
All samples will be collected at the laboratory, hospital or other city designated testing facility including but not limited to any law enforcement agency that has an Intox 5000 or similar device. The samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee, the date and time the sample was collected, and the location where the sample was collected. A chain of custody/control will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs. Every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employee/applicant in question.
3.
When testing for alcohol, a breathalyzer, such as the Intox 5000 or other similar device. Any measurable amount of alcohol found will be sufficient for a presumption of impairment, unless such measurement is the result of consumption of alcohol or an alcohol related product that is prescribed by a licensed physician. Some departments may require more restrictive standards than described herein. The employee has the right to request a blood test if he so desires. This test will be at the employee's expense.
4.
The city/BLW will use urine samples for controlled substance testing even though the presence of foreign metabolites in urine does not necessarily indicate impairment, but rather recent exposure to the substance. However, alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive, but may be used if necessary.
5.
The city/BLW will utilize the testing standards of the department of transportation regulations as provided in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended and as may be hereafter amended. The following is a brief outline of the methods to be used. The city/BLW will utilize the technique known as immunoassay technique of chemical testing. The immunoassay technique has a high degree of reliability under "optimal" conditions. However, all positive immunoassay tests on current employees shall be confirmed by another more elaborate and thorough test method. Confirmatory methods include any one of the following techniques: thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. All positive immunoassay tests on samples from applicants will be confirmed with a repeat administration of the immunoassay technique on the sample.
B.
Testing Procedure. The alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in six different situations: the preemployment or promotion/demotion/transfer screen; the screen as part of any required annual physical examination; the "reasonable suspicion" screen; post accident screen; random test program for safety sensitive positions and drivers of city/BLW vehicles; and random test program after return to work after an alcohol and/or controlled substance policy violation.
1.
Post Employment Offer or Promotion/Demotion/Transfer Screen.
a.
After an employment offer has been made to a prospective employee, but before employment has begun or any employee who has applied for and is offered a safety sensitive position, a position requiring driving of a city/BLW vehicle or any other position with the city/BLW not prohibited by law, will be sent to the human resources department and scheduled for a post employment offer alcohol and controlled substance test. The applicant when sent to the testing facility will be asked to sign consent and notice form. Job candidate applicants, including current employees, are required to provide truthful statements to the questions asked. Any false statements provided will result in rescission of the employment offer and in the case of current employees, could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
b.
Should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form, the application process will continue. On the application it will be noted only that the applicant "refused screen". It will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant. The applicant has a right to refuse to consent to the test, but the city/BLW has a parallel right to refuse to hire/promote/transfer/voluntarily demote the applicant. However, should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date, the city will protect the confidentiality of the application process. For instance, if another employer contacts the city/BLW in the context of a reference check, the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment". It will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcohol/controlled substances screen unless required to defend, answer and/or litigate a suit or through some other legal action.
c.
If the applicant being considered for the position has consented to the test and the test results are negative, the applicant will continue with the hiring process. However, should the test results come back positive, the test must be confirmed utilizing the same sample originally provided.
d.
All test results are confidential except as provided herein. If a preemployment test is confirmed a positive result, all inquiries as to why the applicant who is not a current city/BLW employee, was not hired will be answered by stating, "the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for the position". However, the city/BLW reserves the right to notify the current department head of any employee who tests positive on any alcohol/drug screen conducted as a part of any application process for another position within the city/BLW organization. All applicants with a confirmed positive result may reapply at a later date at which time he/she will submit to another alcohol/controlled substance screening test.
2.
Medical Examination Screen.
a.
At the time the employee is to undergo a required medical examination, the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be explained to the employee and he/she will sign the "employee consent and notice" form at the testing facility. Alcohol testing may be performed by the use of the standard breathalyzer, Intox 5000 or any similar device approved by the state crime lab director at a city designated testing facility including, but not limited to, any law enforcement agency that has such equipment.
b.
Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the medical examination will proceed. After the examination has been completed, the employee will be suspended with pay, following the procedure set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. The employee may be terminated for "insubordination", pursuant to the procedure set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. The stated reason for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of supervisors", or other reason listed in Article 4-4-20.
c.
If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work if he has passed the rest of the medical examination. However, should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed by one of the more specific confirmatory tests cited above utilizing the same sample originally provided. If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be impaired, and may be suspended with pay pending investigation for discharge, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and Article 4-4-20 of this chapter.
d.
During the period of suspension, an intensive investigation into the employee's employment background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violation will take place. After the investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be either:
(1)
Disciplined up to and including termination; or
(2)
Referred for assessment/treatment by his department head.
e.
If after the investigation has been completed it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of impairment by submitting to a blood test within three hours after the original test, and the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated to his former position.
3.
"Reasonable Suspicion" Screen.
a.
The screen upon reasonable suspicion involves a great deal of discretion on the part of supervisory personnel. The supervisory training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser. The task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker. The fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee; that is, demonstrated employee behavior. It is not the position of the supervisor to act in the role of a diagnostician. When it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy, the employee will only be told that job-related problems have developed and that it is suspected that these job-related problems are the result of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse. The underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor.
b.
The phrase "reasonable suspicion" means that a screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated this policy.
c.
A "suspicion" must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse or other policy violations. Therefore, forms have been developed to provide guidance to supervisors in assessing whether a "reasonable suspicion" exists as well as providing documentation of the basis of a decision to require an alcohol or controlled substance test. Thorough documentation of all steps of an investigation for a possible violation of this policy is a must including the date and time of any discussion with the employee. For further information, see Section 4-4-26-040 above, procedural guide for violations.
4.
Post Accident Screen. After an on-the-job accident involving injury to the employee or others or property damage, the department head, with approval of the human resources director, may require testing for alcohol and/or controlled substances.
5.
Random Testing for Safety Sensitive Positions. The random testing program shall include all employees who 1) perform safety sensitive functions (see Section 4-4-26-015(D) above) which shall include but is not limited to those employees who regularly drive a city/BLW vehicle as part of the required duties of their position; or 2) are required by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 49 CFR, Part 382, to maintain a commercial driver's license. Employees in safety sensitive positions as described above are subject to random alcohol and controlled substance testing at an annual percentage for the calendar year as prescribed by the Federal Highway Administration for all CDL holders. The tests will be unannounced and will be reasonably spaced throughout the year. Drivers chosen for a random test must proceed immediately upon notification of the random test to the designated test site.
6.
Return to Duty After Policy Violation. If an employee has been relieved of duty for a prohibited use of alcohol or controlled substances, that employee shall undergo an alcohol and controlled substance test before returning to work, if permitted to do so. The results of such test must be negative. If an employee is returned to duty, the employee is required to comply with the conditions of a rehabilitation program, such employee shall be subject up to nine unannounced tests in the first 12 months after their return and up to 18 unannounced tests in the 36 months following return to duty.
(Code 1978, § 4-1168; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6905, 4/12/2006, § 2; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 12; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1)
4-4-26-090 - Disciplinary actions.
A.
The suspension or termination of an employee will never be justified on the basis that the employee is an alcoholic or substance abuser. Instead, discipline will center around the employee's failure to meet objective, job-related criteria. "Substandard performance," "insubordination," "violation of policy," or "failure to follow orders," "under the influence of alcohol while on duty" are examples of proper reasons for discipline.
B.
Discriminatory enforcement will not be tolerated and any supervisor exhibiting such behavior will be disciplined accordingly.
C.
