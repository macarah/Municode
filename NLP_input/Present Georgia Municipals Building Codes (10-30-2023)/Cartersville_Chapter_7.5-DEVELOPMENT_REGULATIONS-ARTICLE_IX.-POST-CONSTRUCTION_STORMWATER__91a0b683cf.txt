Editor's note— Ord. No. 28-20, § 1, adopted Nov. 5, 2020, repealed the former art. IX, §§ 7.5-221—7.5-228, and enacted a new art. IX as set out herein. The former art. IX pertained to post-development stormwater management for new development and redevelopment, and derived from Ord. No. 61-06, § 1, adopted Aug. 17, 2006.

Sec. 7.5-221. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. Proper management of post- construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the City of Cartersville is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post- construction stormwater runoff.

To the extent (a) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (b) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one (1) inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 7.5-225, the City of Cartersville may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(e)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches:
