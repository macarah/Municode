Subpart A - CHARTER[1]
Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— The City of Hartwell, Georgia, was originally incorporated February 26, 1856, by 1855 Ga. Laws (Act No. 321), page 323. Printed herein is the most current Charter of the city, as adopted by 1992 Ga. Laws (Act No. 764), page 5476. The sequence of sections within each article are the same as in the act comprising it. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by history notes following amended provisions, except for 1957 Ga. Laws (Act No. 414), § 1, page 3128, which amended the Charter by directing that the word "city" be substituted throughout the Charter for the word "town." That substitution has been accomplished without history note. Otherwise, the absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been retained, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
