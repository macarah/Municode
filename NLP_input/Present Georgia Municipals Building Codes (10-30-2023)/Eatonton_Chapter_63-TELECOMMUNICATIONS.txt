Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of April 2, 2002 did not specifically amend the Code. At the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been added as new §§ 63-1—63-7.

Sec. 63-1. - Purposes.
These regulations are designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Putnam County and the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunication towers (excluding HAM and other amateur radio towers, emergency service radio towers, etc;...) within Putnam County and the city so as to protect the welfare, safety, character and integrity of residential neighborhoods and the overall community; provide the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities to serve the residents of Putnam County and the city; protect the environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunication facilities; minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; to avoid adverse impacts to other communication carriers; avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout Putnam County and the city; maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures and co-location as a primary option rather than construction of single use towers; provide for location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned residential; and provide for the removal of all towers that are either abandoned or fail to meet the requirements set forth in these regulations.
(Ord. of 4-2-02, § 1)
Sec. 63-2. - Registration required.
In order to provide the governing authority with accurate and current information concerning the telecommunications providers who offer or provide wireless telecommunications services within Putnam County and the city; to assist the governing authority in enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance of Putnam County and the city Zoning Ordinance; to assist the governing authority in the collection and enforcement of any fees or charges that may be due Putnam County; and to assist the governing authority in monitoring compliance with local, state, and federal laws, all owners of telecommunications towers that offer or provide any telecommunications service within Putnam County, Georgia shall register annually with the Putnam County Planning and Engineering Department for a registration fee of $35.00, on forms to be provided by the Putnam County Planning and Engineering Department, which form shall include the following:
(1)
The identity and legal status of the registrant, including any affiliates;
(2)
The name, address, and telephone number of the officer, agent, or employee responsible for the accuracy of the registrant's information;
(3)
A description of the telecommunications service the registrant intends to offer or provide, or is currently offering or providing, to persons, firms, businesses, or institutions within Putnam County;

(5)
A narrative and map description of the applicant's existing wireless telecommunication facilities towers that are either within Putnam County and the city or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The governing authority may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this ordinance or with other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of Putnam County and the city; provided, however, that the governing authority is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. Any loss of use, increase in use, or change in use of existing antennas or towers must be reported at the time the change occurs; and
(6)
Such other information as the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department, board of commissioners or city council of the city may reasonably require;
(7)

Antennas on existing structures will be subject to the conditions of the previous paragraph. Towers that are taller than prescribed in this paragraph may seek a conditional use, but there is no guarantee of an approval.
f.
Temporary telecommunications tower for a period not to exceed six months in any nonresidential district provided height does not exceed district requirements and provided the temporary tower is setback from any protected corridors set forth is section 63-5 a distance of at least 200 feet from the right of way. A temporary permit is all that may be conditionally approved.
(3)
Prohibitions. No new cell tower may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new cell is to serve. A propagation study will be required to show proof that coverage objections cannot be met, should a carrier seek a variance to this provision.
(4)
Preferred Location Sites. Any telecommunications towers being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication and any existing structure shall be a preferred location site for antenna where located within non residential districts; provided, however, that locations which meet these criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article.
(Ord. of 4-2-02, § 5)
Sec. 63-6. - General provisions.
The following provisions are applicable to all towers and antennas regardless of location unless context limits application to towers only:
(1)
Landscaping and maintenance: Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent properties. As such, a landscaping buffer consisting of evergreen material that is at least six feet in height, xeriscape tolerant, or irrigated, shall be planted on all sides of the site, Said landscaping plan shall be submitted to the planning and engineering department when the building permit is applied for. Said buffer shall be maintained and any loss of vegetation within the buffer shall be replaced by the applicant. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as tower sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may provide a sufficient buffer as determined by the appropriate authority (city/county). Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. The landscaping maintenance set forth herein shall be a required condition for approval of the annual occupation registration. No more than two parking spaces per facility shall be allowed, and a minimum ten foot wide turnaround drive with an all-weather surface shall be required if parking spaces are provided.
(2)
Lighting: Towers and antennas shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding area and views, or the tower shall use a dual lighting system consisting of a strobe light during the day and a slow flashing red light at night unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
(3)
Removal of abandoned towers and antennas: After a continuous period of 12 months during which an antenna or tower is not used for its original purpose (including upgraded equipment), it shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department notifying the owner of such abandonment. The owner may request a three-month extension prior to the end of the twelve-month period. Said three-month extension may be granted administratively by the planning and engineering department if the request is received in writing by the planning and engineering department prior to the end of the twelve-month period. If a three-month grace period is granted, then a notice of abandonment will be given to the owner at the end of the three-month period. If any abandoned antenna or tower is not removed by the owner within said 90 days after notice of abandonment, then the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective for the tower until all users cease using the tower. Within 30 days of the owner's receipt of said notice of abandonment, any owner aggrieved by said notice of abandonment may file a written request to be heard before the governing authority.
In addition, prior to the issuance of any tower construction permit, the applicant shall submit security for the costs of removal of the structure in an amount estimated by the applicant and approved by the building official as sufficient to cover the costs of removal. Such security may be in the form of:
a.
An 18 month security bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, payable to the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department; the security bond shall be renewed at the time the annual operating permit is renewed in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of removal at the time of renewal. Such renewal bond must be approved by the building official.
b.
A deposit of cash with the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department or an escrow of any other instrument readily convertible to cash at face value with a financial institutional; and in case of an escrow account, the bank with which the funds are deposited, being subject to the approval of the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department. In the case of an escrow account, the applicant shall file with the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department an agreement between the financial institution and the applicant specifying the funds that are in the escrow account shall be held in trust until released by the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department and may not be used or pledged by the applicant as security in any other matter during that period and that, in the case of the applicant's failure to remove the tower and antennas in accordance with the terms set forth above, then the bank shall immediately make the funds available to the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department for use of completion of the removal of the structure. Said deposit of cash shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal.
c.
A letter of credit from a financial institution in a form approved by the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department providing that the financial institution does guarantee funds in an amount equal to the aforementioned cost of removal and that in the event the applicant fails to remove the structure in accordance with the terms set forth above, the financial institution shall pay to the Putnam County Planning & Engineering Department immediately and without further action, such funds as necessary to finance the removal of the structure up to the amount specified in the letter of credit. Such amount shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal.
(4)
Setbacks and separation: The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers.
a.
Freestanding towers must be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from adjacent property lines, as measured radially from the from the base of tower to the property line of the subject property; and
b.
Freestanding towers must also be set back from all single and two-family residential districts and historic districts or historic landmarks, a distance of the total height of the tower in all directions, as measured radially from the base of the tower to the district boundaries or landmark boundaries; and
c.
Guy wires and accessory facilities associated with towers must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for buildings.
d.
All lattice or guy-wired towers constructed after the effective date of this ordinance shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements as set out in chart form below. Antennas mounted on rooftops, monopole towers, or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances as set out in chart form below. Except in the Industrial district, monopole towers shall be separated from any other tower at least a distance equal to 1200 feet in all directions. In the Industrial District the separation distance between monopole towers shall equal the height of the tallest tower adjacent to the monopole tower. All freestanding towers which are alternative in design (stealth design) shall be separated from any other towers a minimum distance of the height of the tallest tower to which it is adjacent.
EXPAND
Lattice or Guy-Wired Tower Height Next Closest Tower Height 50 Feet Separation Next Closest Tower Height 50-100 Feet Separation Next Closest Tower Height 101-150 Feet Separation Next Closest Tower Height 150 Feet Separation

150'+ 1000' 1500' 2000' 2500'
  (5)
Tower color: The color of the tower shall be either painted gray or left in its natural gray metallic state unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
(6)
Insurance: Commercial general liability insurance shall be required with combined single limits of liability coverage of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence, for bodily injury and property damages, with respect to the construction, use of the property, maintenance, operation, or other liabilities associated with a telecommunication tower. An adequately funded self-insurance program will be considered as a substitute for commercial insurance, if approved and subject to any condition imposed by the governing authority.
(7)
Federal and state requirements: All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and any other agency of the federal government or state government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the compliance schedule mandated by the controlling federal or state agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna by the owner or by the local governing authority at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided above.
(8)
Building codes and safety standards: To insure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a town shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the latest edition of the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. A professional engineer shall certify that all antennas, towers, and wireless telecommunications equipment are erected and installed so as to comply with said codes and standards.
(9)
Security fence. All towers shall have a security fence of not less than six feet in height with anti-climbing devices on the fence. A sign no larger than 32 square feet in size shall be placed on the security fence or other outermost structural element of the telecommunication facility; which sign shall state the name and telephone number of a person responsible for the safety and maintenance of said facility and emergency contact numbers. No other signs, symbols, or advertisements shall be allowed on the security fence or on any monopole, tower, or antenna. Check with the office of Putnam County Planning and Engineering for sign permits and allowable sign sizes.
(10)
Noise: The intensity level of sound from the wireless telecommunications facility including temporary generators used during power outages, measured at the property line of abutting property zoned for residential use shall not at any time exceed 70 decibels from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 55 decibels from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.; and abutting property zoned for nonresidential use the same shall not exceed 80 decibels at any time.
(11)
Maintenance of telecommunications facilities: Towers must be properly and routinely maintained in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all included in submittal information. The owner shall provide the Putnam County Planning and Engineering Department with a certified copy of the engineer's inspection report, which includes, but is not limited to, the condition of the grounding system, the structural integrity of the facility, any damage incurred over the past year, the condition of the bolts, and a plan to correct any deficienceies. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communications towers as follows: Guyed tower at least once every two years; lattice or self-supported towers every three years; and monopoles every three to five years to insure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the Putnam County Planning and Engineering Department. If, upon inspection, the Putnam County Planning and Engineering Department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days from the date of the mailing of such notice, to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, or the owner may submit an alternate schedule for approval within 30 days of notice. There is no guarantee an alternate schedule will be approved. The governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense, if the deadline is not met. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided.
(12)
Fire prevention: All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and operated in such a manner so as to minimize the risk of igniting a fire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs. To this end all of the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunications facilities when determined necessary by the state fire marshal. Demonstration of compliance with requirements (1) through (5) shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by the state fire marshal on the building plans submitted.
a.
At least one-hour fire-resistant interior sufraces shall be used in the construction of all building;
b.
Monitored automatic fire extinguishing systems approved by the state fire marshal shall be installed in all equipment buildings and enclosures;
c.
Rapid entry (KNOX) systems shall be installed as required by the state fire marshal;
d.
Type and location of vegetation and other materials within ten feet of the facility and all new structures, including telecommunication towers, shall have review for fire safety purposes by the state fire marshal. Requirements established by the state fire marshal shall be followed; and
e.
All tree trimmings and trash generated by construction of the facility shall be removed from the property and properly disposed of prior to building permit finalization or commencement of operation, whichever comes first.
(13)
Co-location: Each telecommunications tower application shall be required by affidavit of the applicant to make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers within the applicant's search ring can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below:
a.
The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers within the applicant's search ring of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height necessary to accommodate the applicant's antenna. Such contact shall be by certified mail/return receipt requested. The applicant shall provide a list of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, the form and content of such contact, and a copy of the return receipt of the certified mail.
b.
The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted:
1.
Identification of the site by location, tax map and parcel number, existing uses on or adjacent to the site, and tower height;
2.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna;
3.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required;
4.
If structurally able, would shared use on such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing tower or antenna(s) or the proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed antenna, if at all; and
5.
if shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use.
6.
Co-location on an existing tower will only require a building permit, as the tower would have already obtained or conditional use.
c.
Such request shall be made at least one month prior to the filing of an application for a building permit or conditional use. Responses to such request shall also be included.
1.
Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the response of such owner is filed, or in the case of a failure to respond, proof of the applicant's attempted contact with the correct owner to the correct address by certified mail/return receipt requested is filed by the applicant, or by way of a propagation study which shows the tower in technically flawed for the required coverage.
2.
The governing authority shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner.
3.
Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the application cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
d.
The governing authority may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee for shared use and the costs to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. Shared use is not precluded simply based on fee and cost structures, unless found to be unreasonable by the local governing authority.
e.
If the owner of an approved or pre-existing tower refuses to allow co-location, an affidavit shall be required that states the reason for the refusal. An unsubstantiated refusal by the owner of a tower to allow for co-location not supported by the required engineering evidence shall be a reason for the governing authority to refuse to renew the annual operating permit of said approved or pre-existing tower. It is understood that pricing is propriety and therefore can and will be considered a valid reason. Generally however, the only other reasons for revoking a tower permit would be for continued non-compliance of health, safety, and general welfare issues, relating to tower maintenance.
In addition, evidence submitted by the applicant based on a report by a certified engineer to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna shall be required and shall be required and shall consist of the following:
1.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
2.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
3.
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
4.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
5.
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure are in excess of the cost of new tower development and location to the extent that co-location would impose a significant financial burden on the applicant; and
6.
The applicant demonstrates there are other limiting factors that render existing towers or structures unsuitable.
7.
If co-location on an existing tower or structure is not possible as set forth above, and a new tower is deemed appropriate, then the new tower must be constructed to allow co-location of antennas and the applicant must agree to accommodate the co-location of other antennas on the new tower, according to the following: For towers up to 100 feet in height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least two users; for towers up to 125 feet in total height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three users; and for towers more than 125 feet in height, the tower and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four users, unless the proposed tower is an alternative tower structure or stealth design.
(14)
Any new antenna/provider shall ensure there will be no interference to other providers or customers in the area. If such occurs this may result in an immediate resention of the permit and service may be required to be terminated immediately.
(Ord. of 4-2-02, § 6)
Sec. 63-7. - Permits.
(a)
Procedures for conditional use permits. The following provisions shall govern the application for and consideration of conditional use permits for towers and antennas:
(1)
Conditional use permits shall be applied for and considered in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance of Putnam County and the city zoning ordinance. The fee for conditional use application is $500.00. Conditional use permits are not required for co-locations on an existing tower. When appropriate in achieving the purposes of the section, the governing authority may waive or reduce any requirements or standards during the conditional use process. Additional fees shall be charged to cover the actual cost to the local government of obtaining expert opinion and studies in reviewing applications for conditional use. The initial deposit for such additional fees shall cover a minimum of ten hours of an expert consultant's hourly rate to provide consultation to Putnam County. If the actual cost to the government is greater than the initial deposit, the applicant shall be billed for the difference and shall pay the bill in full prior to the hearing before the commission/council. If the actual cost to the government is less than the initial deposit, the actual cost will be deducted from the initial deposit and the remainder of the deposit will be refunded to the applicant within ten working days following the hearing before the commission/council. In addition to the requirements of this section, the staff shall provide to the zoning commission substantial evidence contained in a written record in support of the staff's written recommendation regarding the petition for consideration by the zoning commission at its regularly scheduled meeting. In addition to the requirements, the zoning commission's written recommendation to the commission/council shall be based on substantial evidence contained in a written record provided to the commission/council.
(2)
Any engineering information, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, that an applicant submits shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer; however, information relative to radio frequency information by radio frequency engineers does not require certification.
(3)
If an environmental assessment is required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a copy of the assessment, as well as documentation of the FCC's subsequent approval thereof, must be submitted at the time of application. In addition, the applicant shall be required to submit documentation that the proposed wireless telecommunications facility complies with current Federal Communications Commission standards for radio frequency emissions, as adopted by the FCC at the time of application. Under no circumstances shall emissions cause, interference with other communication providers (cellular or non-cellular) and documentation shall be provided to this end.
(4)
In considering a conditional use permit, the governing authority may impose conditions, to the extent necessary, to minimize any adverse effects the proposed tower or antenna may have on the adjoining properties if after considering all of the factors required, the governing authority decides conditions can reduce such adverse impacts upon adjoining properties to an acceptable and reasonable level.
(5)
The governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit; provided, however, the governing authority may consider additional factors if the governing authority concludes that the goals of this section are better served thereby:
a.
Height and setbacks of the proposed antenna and tower;
b.
Proximity of the antenna and tower to other structures and zoning district boundaries;
c.
Nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d.
Surrounding topography;
e.
Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f.
Design of the antenna or tower, with particular reference to design features that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
g.
Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers or other structures for antenna co-location;
h.
Proximity of the antenna or tower to other antennas or towers;
i.
Impact of the tower and antenna upon scenic views and upon visual quality of surrounding areas; and
j.
Such other and additional standards of review as set forth concerning conditional uses, of the Zoning Ordinance of Putnam County or the city zoning ordinance.
(6)
Any decision to deny a conditional use permit shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. No decision to deny a conditional use permit for a wireless telecommunications tower or antenna shall be based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent such facilities comply with the Federal Communications Commission's regulations concerning such emissions.
(7)
Public notice for location of tower: In addition to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance of Putnam County and the city zoning ordinance, the following additional public noticing shall be provided for towers more than one hundred 150 feet in total height to be located within 1200 feet of any residential district: at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the required public hearing, the applicant shall cause to be floated from the proposed tower site a balloon of the standard size used in aerial line of sight surveys. Said balloon shall be floated to the height of the proposed tower for a period of three working days so that the visibility of the tower from locations surrounding the proposed tower site ban be viewed by the public prior to the required hearing.
