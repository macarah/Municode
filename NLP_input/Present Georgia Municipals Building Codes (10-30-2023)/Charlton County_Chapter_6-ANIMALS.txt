(2)
Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this definition; or
(3)
While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this definition shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog or predator control dog.
