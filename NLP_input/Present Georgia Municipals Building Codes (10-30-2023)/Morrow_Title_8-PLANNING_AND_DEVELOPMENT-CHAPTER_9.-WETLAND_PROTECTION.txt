CHAPTER 9. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 8-9-1. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This chapter shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Morrow, Georgia. The purpose of this chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this chapter is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, flood plain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Ord. No. 2000-09, § 1, 5-9-00)
Sec. 8-9-2. - Definitions.
[As used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:]
Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archaeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities.
Generalized Wetland Protection District Map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of Morrow, Georgia, as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map. This map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Morrow and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 8-9-3(b)(7).
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
(Ord. No. 2000-09, § 1, 5-9-00)
Sec. 8-9-3. - Development permits.
(a)
Development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within 25 feet of a wetland area without written permission from the public works director in the form of a development permit. Issuance of a development permit is contingent upon full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. If the public works director determines a project appears to contain wetlands or be located within 25 feet of a wetland area, as identified on the Generalized Wetland Protection District Map, the developer must consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a determination. Additionally, all activities that are not identified by existing development ordinances shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a development permit. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. However, section 404 does list some required performance standards and 15 specific road construction best management practices (BMPs) that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.
(4)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(5)
Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the public works director or his/her designee for the following reasons:
•Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice before the commencement of work has been given to the public works director and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
•Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
•Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(c)
Site plans. Applications for a development permit within 25 feet of a wetland area shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of 1:400 feet, with the following information:
(1)
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.
(2)
A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.
(3)
