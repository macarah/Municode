Any owner of land which lies within the area of jurisdiction of this chapter who wishes to divide or resubdivide such land into two or more lots, sites, or divisions, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, shall submit a plan of such proposed subdivision to the planning commission for approval, and shall obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record.
(b)
In order to secure review and approval of a proposed subdivision by the planning commission, the prospective subdivider shall, prior to making any street improvements or installations of utilities, submit to the planning commission a preliminary plat as provided in division 2 of this article. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered state land surveyor. After approval of such preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed with construction and the preparation of the final plat and other documents required in connection therewith as specified in division 2 of this article and section 78-43.
(c)
No plat of a subdivision of land within the area of planning jurisdiction of the city shall be filed or recorded by the clerk of court without the prior approval of the planning commission as specified in this section.
(Ord. No. 95-21, § 3.00, 11-13-1995)

Sec. 78-72. - Easements.
(a)
Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities and drainage, where necessary, and shall not be less than a total of 15 feet wide, unless otherwise approved by the engineering department of the specific utility.
(b)
Where a subdivision is traversed by an existing or proposed watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such existing or planned drainageway. The width of such drainage easement or right-of-way shall be sufficient to contain the ultimate channel and maintenance way for the tributary area upstream.
(c)
Lots and easements shall be arranged in such a manner as to eliminate unnecessary easement jobs or offsets, and to facilitate the use of easements for power distribution, telephone service, drainage, and water and sewer services.
(Ord. No. 95-21, § 11.00, 11-13-1995)
Sec. 78-73. - Drainage and inundation.
(a)
A drainage plan shall be made for each subdivision by the owner's engineer or certified surveyor, which plan shall take into consideration the ultimate or saturated development of the tributary area in which the proposed subdivision is located. Adequate provisions shall be made to provide drainage easements needed within the subdivision, taking into consideration the saturated development of the tributary area.
(b)
The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be worked out prior to the development of the other utility plans. Engineering considerations shall give preferential treatment to these gravity flow improvements, as opposed to other utilities and improvements. Off-premises drainage easements and improvements may be required to handle the runoff of subdivisions into a natural drainage channel. But under no condition shall storm drainage be emptied into the sanitary sewer system, or vice versa.
(c)
Low areas subject to periodic inundation shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the planning commission establishes that:
(1)
The nature of the land use (i.e., recreational areas) would not lend itself to damage by water inundation to an appreciable extent;
(2)
The area may be filled or improved in such a manner to prevent such periodic inundation; or
(3)
Minimum floor elevations are required to prevent damage to buildings and structures.
(d)
The planning commission may require whatever additional engineering information it deems necessary to make a decision on subdivisions and other development which contains an area of questionable drainage. Lakes, ponds and similar areas will be accepted for maintenance only if sufficient land is dedicated as a public recreation area, or if such area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage control system. Such park land will be subject to approval by the governing body.
