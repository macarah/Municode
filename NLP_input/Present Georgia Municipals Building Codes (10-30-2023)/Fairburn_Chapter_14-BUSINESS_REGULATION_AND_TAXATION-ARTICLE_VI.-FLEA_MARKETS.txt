ARTICLE VI. - FLEA MARKETS

Sec. 14-163. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Flea market means and includes any business, whether operated as an individual concern or operated as a unit within a larger organization, structure or facility which derives 25 percent of its gross receipts from the sale, trade or barter of used or previously owned personal property, other than operable motor vehicles. In this connection, therefore, all businesses in the city which meet the definition contained herein shall be subject to the provisions of this article dealing with flea markets, whether the same be generally known as jewelry stores, coin shops, salvage operations, clothing stores or by any other name or names; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall apply to any purchase where the retail value of the merchandise or goods is $10.00 or less. The term "flea market" is interchangeable with and applicable to "swap meet," "indoor swap meet," or other similar terms regardless of whether these events are held inside a building or outside in the open. The primary characteristic is that these activities involve a series of sales sufficient in number, scope, and character to constitute a regular course of business.
Flea market operator means a person who owns or has charge, care or control of the flea market.
Flea market vendor means a person who engages in the retail sale of personal property at a flea market.

Sec. 14-164. - Promoters and vendors; license required; revocation.
(a)
Flea market promoters. All persons before beginning the business of operating and promoting a flea market shall first file an application with the city manager for a license to conduct such business. Such application shall be made on a form presented by the city manager and shall contain such information as, in the opinion of the city manager, is necessary to properly regulate the business.
(b)
Flea market vendors. All persons, before beginning the business of selling, buying, trading or bartering in a flea market, shall first file an application with the city manager for a license to conduct such business. Such application shall be made on a form presented by the city manager and shall contain such information as, in the opinion of the city manager, is necessary to properly regulate the business.
(c)
Investigation of applications. The chief of police shall cause an investigation to be made into the information contained in the applications described above (promoters and vendors) and into the background, character and reputation of applicants as the chief deems advisable. After such investigation, the chief shall file a written report with the city manager, whose duty it shall be to make a decision on the issuance of the license.
(d)
Revocation of license. The city manager shall revoke the license of any flea market promoter when, in the sole discretion of the city manager, such revocation is necessary to prevent the purchase, sale, barter or trade of stolen property or to prevent the purchase, sale, barter or trade of property with minors; and provided the promoter has been previously warned of such activity and has not taken action to prevent a recurrence. The city manager shall have the duty to revoke the license of any vendor when, in the discretion of the city manager, such revocation is necessary to prevent the activity described above concerning stolen property or minors; and the failure to keep and provide accurate records shall be prima facie evidence of a vendor dealing in stolen property or with minors or both.
(Code 1966, § 10A-2; Ord. No. 88-7, § I, 11-28-1988)
Sec. 14-165. - Precautions to be taken.

Records; identification. All vendors in flea markets and all other businesses similarly situated which meet the definition of section 14-163 shall keep accurate records of all transactions of $10.00 or more where cash, credit or merchandise is bought or traded for by those vendors. The record of each transaction shall be made on a form prescribed by the city manager and furnished by the vendor. The form shall be dated and require an accurate description of the personal property, including identifying marks, numbers and manufacturers and shall include personal identification as to name, address, sex, race, height, weight and date of birth, and shall include either a legible thumbprint or information showing that the vendor was shown positive identification by the seller or trader of the property. A valid driver's license with photo or identification of like quality shall be required, and such identification shall be all that is acceptable as positive identification. The city manager may from time to time describe identification other than driver's licenses that may be accepted as positive identification and which, in his opinion, is of like quality.
(b)
Forms to be supplied to law enforcement officers. Each business covered by subsection (a) of this subsection shall provide law enforcement officers with the forms completed since the last previous request for the same.
