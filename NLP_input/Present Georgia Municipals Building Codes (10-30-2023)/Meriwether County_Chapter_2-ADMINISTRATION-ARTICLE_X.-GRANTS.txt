ARTICLE X. - GRANTS

Sec. 2-294. - Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to provide direction in the application acceptance and administration of funds awarded through grants to the county from other local governments, the state or federal government, nonprofit agencies, philanthropic organizations and the private sector.
(Code 1991, § 2-325; Ord. No. 2011-06, 10-25-2011)
Sec. 2-295. - Application and acceptance of grants.
(a)
The county administrator is given authority to make application for and accept grants that:
(1)
Are expected to be $50,000.00 or less on an annual basis with no required county match;
(2)
Are expected to be $25,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of 20 percent or less; or
(3)
Are expected to be $10,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of over 40 percent.
(b)
The county commission must approve the application of and acceptance of any grants in excess of the limits established in this section.
(c)
The county will assess the merits of a particular program as if it were funded with local tax dollars. Local tax dollars will not be used to make up for losses of inter-governmental aid without first reviewing the program and its merits as a budgetary increment. Therefore, no grant will be accepted that will incur management and reporting costs greater than the grant amount.
(Code 1991, § 2-326; Ord. No. 2011-06, 10-25-2011)
Sec. 2-296. - Grant administration.
Each department, authority, constitutional officer or board must notify the county administrator upon acceptance of any grant. Prior to the receipt or expenditure of grant revenues, the county administrator must be provided with the following information prior to receiving grant revenues or making purchases against the grant:
(1)
Copy of grant application.
(2)
Notification of grant award.
(3)
Financial reporting and accounting requirements including separate account codes and/or bank accounts.
(4)
