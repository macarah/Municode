7-10-040 - Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in Section 7-10-030 of this chapter. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
A.
Grandfather Provisions. This chapter shall not apply to the following activities:
1.
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this chapter.
2.
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
3.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval, or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this chapter.
4.
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of this chapter.
B.
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this chapter. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
1.
Activities for the purpose of building one of the following:
a.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line;
b.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
c.
Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;
d.
Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks;
e.
Unpaved foot trails and paths;
f.
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native noninvasive vegetation are used;
2.
Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other-transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in 7-10-040(B)(1), above.
3.
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter.
4.
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures.
5.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the public works department on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the public works department to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
6.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
After the effective date of this chapter, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Section 7-10-050(B) below.
(Ord. No. 6971, 10/11/2006, § 4; Ord. No. 8202 , 12/9/2020, § 1)
7-10-050 - Land development requirements.
A.
Buffer and Setback Requirements. All land development activity subject to this chapter shall meet the following requirements:
1.
An undisturbed native noninvasive vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the stream. In the event of removal of a buffer area same shall be immediately replaced with native noninvasive vegetation.
2.
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed native noninvasive vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
3.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
B.
Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
1.
Where a parcel was platted prior to October 11, 2006 and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this chapter, and the public works director, or his designee, finds and determines that the requirements of this chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city council of the City of Marietta may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
2.
Where proposed encroachments into the buffer and/or impervious setback total less than or equal to 1,500 square feet, the public works director, or his designee, may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
3.
Except as provided above, the city council of the City of Marietta shall grant no variance from any provision of this chapter without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council of the City of Marietta. The City of Marietta shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within City of Marietta. The City of Marietta shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
4.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted;
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this chapter would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
5.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
6.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
