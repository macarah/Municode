modified
(a)
The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by a user into the POTW shall be measured by one or more of the following methods:
(1)
If the volume of water used by any user is substantially the same as the volume secured from the municipal waterworks system, the volume of water purchased shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged.
(2)
If a substantial portion of the water secured by a user from the municipal waterworks system is not returned to the POTW, the quantity of wastewater shall be determined as follows:
a.
By a meter on the water supply line to his industrial or process operations not discharging to the POTW; or
b.
By a meter on his waste line which discharges into the POTW;
c.
If a meter as required under subsection (a)(2)a. or b. of this section shall not have been installed, or if at any time the installed meter stop accurately recording flows discharged into the sewage system, the user shall immediately install or repair the meter. For the first 90 days from the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, that the meter is not installed or if installed, not accurately recording flow, the sewer charge will be based on the average percentage of flow calculated upon the previous three-month flow. If after 90 days the meter is not installed, or if installed is not operational, the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased. If a sewer meter shows incorrect or suspected incorrect flows over four times in one 12-month period, then for the next 12-month period the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased and will continue beyond the 12-month period until the time as it can be demonstrated to the city in a manner satisfactory to the city that the sewer meter is accurately measuring the sewerage flows.
(3)
If any user (now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the POTW) does not secure his entire water supply requirements from the municipal waterworks system, the user shall install and maintain a meter on his waste line which discharge into the POTW or shall install the additional meter on the private water supply as required to permit determination of the total quantity discharged to the POTW from both sources under procedures comparable to those provisions in this chapter.
(b)
All sources of water supply and all discharges of wastewater into the POTW must be identified in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any omission shall be considered as an unauthorized use of the POTW.
(c)
The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
(1)
Regulated process streams; and
(2)
Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
Other flow readings as set forth in the industrial wastewater discharge permit.
The city manager may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.

modified
The city manager shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice with the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of the users that, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" means:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants, except pH);
(3)
Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit or narrative standard) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
(4)
Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the Control Authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance;

(Ord. No. 2020-05, § 1, 8-3-2020)
Sec. 36-416. - Enforcement remedies—Administrative.
modified
(a)
Notification of violation. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of the notice, the user shall submit to the city manager an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the city manager's authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. The documents will include the specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. The documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to the provisions in this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(c)
Show cause hearing. The city manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the city manager or city council and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
(d)
Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirements, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all violations and directing the user to immediately comply with all requirements and take the appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(f)
Administrative fines and bonds.
(1)
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine the user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. The fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2)
Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. A lien against the user's property may be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
(3)
Users desiring to dispute the fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with the full payment of the fine amount within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, along with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4)
The city manager may require that a user causing or allowing a violation of any provision of this article furnish a bond or other security, with terms specified by the city, to hold harmless the city from any loss or expense that it may incur as a result of the violation or of any future noncompliance.
(5)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions. The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever the suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take the steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the city manager's satisfaction that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution, and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing.
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this subsection.
(h)
Termination of discharge. In addition to other penalties provided in this article, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
A violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article.
The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

The city manager may also seek other action as is appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(b)
Civil penalties.
(1)
The city may commence an action for appropriate civil penalties in the county superior court, where the same is necessary to enforce this article or to recover damages caused by the failure of any user to comply with this article.
(2)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(3)

a.
Noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error;
b.
Improperly designed treatment facilities;
c.
Inadequate treatment facilities;
d.
Lack of preventive maintenance; or
e.
Careless or improper operation.
(b)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, city ordinance limits or discharge permit limits, if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met.
(c)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

Sec. 36-421. - Bypass.
modified
(a)
Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage.
(1)
The term "severe property damage" means:
a.
Substantial physical damage to property;
b.
Damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable; or
c.
Substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.
(2)
The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
Permitted. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
Notice.
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain:
a.
A description of the bypass and its cause;
b.
The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times;
c.
If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
d.
Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass.
The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d)
Criteria for approval.
(1)
Where a bypass is prohibited, the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user, unless:
a.
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage;
b.
There are not feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(2)
The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 36-442. - Surcharges.
modified
Sewer use surcharges will be applied for discharges having a five-day BOD greater than 300 mg/l, for discharges containing more than 300 mg/l of suspended solids, for discharges containing more than 20 mg/l of ammonia nitrogen, and for discharges that exceed maximum permitted volume. Where, in the city manager's opinion, the BOD does not provide a meaningful measurement of wastewater strength, the city manager may substitute COD limits and apply surcharges for wastewater having a COD greater than 600 mg/l. The surcharge cost shall be maintained in a rate sheet and may be revised from time to time as the city council finds necessary for maintenance of the purposes set forth in this article.
(1)
For the purposes of applying surcharges, it has been determined that the costs of operating the POTW can reasonably be subdivided into four components, as follows:
a.
Flow related components including collection system elements, pumping facilities and hydraulic capacity at the treatment facilities, which together make up 20 percent of overall operating costs.
b.
Oxygen demand components, including biological treatment process elements, which together make up 25 percent of overall operating costs.
c.
Solids handling components, including clarifiers, digesters, drying beds and sludge disposal facilities, which together make up 35 percent of overall operating costs.
d.
Ammonia nitrogen handling components including a portion of the biological treatment process elements, which together make up 20 percent of overall operating costs.
(2)
In any case where wastewater flow volume exceeds permit limits, or where the wastewater strength exceeds the surcharge limits established by this article, surcharge factors will be computed and applied to the user charges that would otherwise be due. Surcharge factors will be calculated for any or all components exceeding the surcharge limits, and individual components added together to produce a total surcharge factor to be applied as follows:
a.
Where BOD is used with 24-hour composite samples:
b.
Where COD is used with 24-hour composite samples:
