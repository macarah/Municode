Sec. 114-415. - Findings and intent.
The mayor and council find that certain streets or designated portions of certain streets located within the territorial boundaries of the city and under its jurisdiction can be authorized for use by operators of personal transportation vehicles ("PTV"). This article shall set forth the conditions for such use of a PTV.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles ("PTV") and other similar vehicles are not generally designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, and the City of Dalton in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of this article is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable, even if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing obvious safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city accepts no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by state law or this article as a condition of operating personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on the public roads of the city.
