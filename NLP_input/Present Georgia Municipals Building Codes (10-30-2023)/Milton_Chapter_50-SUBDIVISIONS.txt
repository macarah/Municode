Street classifications means the classification of streets based on functions, from high-traffic arterial roads to low traffic residential streets. The following are definitions intended to distinguish between different street classifications. All roadways are classified per the state department of transportation:
Collector means a roadway that has partial or no access control and has more emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility than arterials. The primary purpose is to distribute trips to and from the arterial system and allow access to the local roads.
Freeway means a multi-lane roadway that has full access control and separation of directional traffic. Freeways accommodate large volumes of high speed traffic and provide efficient movement of vehicular traffic for interstate and major through travel.
Frontage street means a road that typically runs parallel to a partial access controlled roadway, a full access controlled facility, or a railroad. Frontage roads provide public access to the adjacent parcels, help control access to the major facility, and/or maintain circulation of traffic on each side of the major facility.
Full access control means preference is given to through traffic by providing access connections only with selected public roads and by prohibiting crossings at grade and direct private connections.
Housing unit service means the number of housing units served by a street or collection of streets shall be the aggregate number of housing units provided, or potentially to be provided, with driveway access directly from the street plus the number of units utilizing or potentially utilizing the street for through traffic movements. Such calculations shall be made at the beginning and ending of the same street intersection.
Local means any roadway that has no access control, and places strong emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility while service to through traffic is discouraged.
Major subdivision street means a local road internal to a subdivision which serves 50 or more housing units. These units do not have to be directly served by the major subdivision street. Major subdivision streets are roads that serve as collectors for the subdivision traffic. Any residential street which accesses a collector or arterial road shall be considered a major subdivision street for the first 300 feet regardless of housing unit service.
Minor arterial means a roadway that has partial or no access control and is primarily used for inter-connectivity of principal arterials and placing more emphasis on access to adjacent land over mobility.
Minor subdivision street means a local road internal to a subdivision which serves fewer than 50 housing units and does not access a collector or arterial road.
No access control means preference is generally given to access to adjacent land rather than mobility.
Partial access control means preference is given to through traffic to a degree that, in addition to connection with selected public roads, there may be some crossing at grades, but private connections shall be prohibited.
Principal arterial means a roadway that has partial or no access control, and is primarily used for fast or large volumes of traffic. Emphasis is placed on mobility rather than access to adjacent land.
Street, private, means a street or modified, single-family residential, access or shared (private drive) driveway that has not been dedicated to the municipality or other government entity.
Street, public, means a dedicated and accepted right-of-way for vehicular traffic.
Street, residential, means streets internal to residential subdivisions. The following definitions are intended to distinguish between different categories of streets internal to residential subdivisions:
Stub-out street means a street having one end open to traffic and being temporarily terminated at the other. Stub-outs generally do not have a temporary vehicular turnaround. This temporary termination is to provide connectivity to future developments and may be constructed without curb and gutter, provided such stub-out street meets the standards of the Fulton County Fire Department.
Subdivider means any property owner, person, individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, agent of property owner, or any other group or combination acting as a unit dividing or proposing to divide land so as to constitute a subdivision.
Subdivision, major, means a subdivision that does not qualify as a minor subdivision.
Subdivision, minor, means a subdivision of no more than three lots, or if any number of single family residential lots provided are each a minimum of three acres or more in size, that, at the time of subdivision, does not necessarily, but may involve:
(1)
A land disturbance permit;
(2)
New streets; or
(3)
The extension of a utility or other municipal facility.
Subdivision, residential and nonresidential, means any division of a lot, tract or parcel, regardless of its existing or future use, into two or more lots, tracts or parcels. The term "subdivision" means the act or process of dividing property, except that, where appropriate to the context, the term "subdivision" may be used in reference to the aggregate of all lots held in common ownership at the time of subdivision.
Traffic mitigation action plan means a plan that studies and addresses the number of trips a subdivision will produce when such development results in the reduction of the level of service on any roadway currently functioning at "D" or worse in accordance with the county transportation standards.
(1)
The term "traffic mitigation action plan" includes, but is not limited to:
a.
Roadway improvements; and
b.

(d)
Sidewalks. The required improvements for sidewalks shall be as follows:
(1)
Introduction.
a.
Purpose. The objective is to provide facilities that ensure safe pedestrian movement in the city.
b.
Intent. Sidewalks are intended to provide a safe pedestrian connection between the subdivision/development and nearby destinations. Pedestrians consist of children walking to and from school and neighborhood activities, as well as adults walking to and from neighborhood shopping and transit stops. In addition to the need for sidewalks for circulation and safety, sidewalks can be important elements in the recreational system of this community. They can also serve as walking and hiking trails.
(2)
Performance approach.
a.
Performance factors. The performance approach shall be applied in determining the need for sidewalks. In this case, the decision to require a development to provide sidewalks shall be made on a case-by-case basis.
b.
Several basic factors shall be used in applying the performance approach. These are street classification and current/potential future volume of pedestrian traffic; residential land use/development density; relation to residential areas; proximity of schools, school bus stops, shopping areas; and proximity of parks, libraries, bike paths/pedestrian trails, greenspace corridors, and other land uses, zoning overlay districts or form based code areas.
1.
Street classification and volume of pedestrian traffic. As traffic volume and road speeds increase, there is more need for separate pedestrian ways to ascertain safety. Sidewalks shall be provided along local streets, collectors, arterials, and private roads according to the density standards in subsection (d)(2)b.2. of this section.
2.
Residential land use and development density.
(i)
Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all local streets where the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is three units/acre or higher density.
(ii)
Sidewalks shall be provided along at least one side of all local streets where the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is one to two units/acre. Residential land use designation of one unit or less shall be decided on a case-by-case basis using the other factors contained in subsection (d)(2)b. of this section.
3.
Relation to residential areas. In general, sidewalks are intended to be within the street right-of-way. This traditional location of sidewalks may be replaced in cluster developments by a flexible pedestrian circulation system. Such a system would connect individual dwelling units with other units, off-street parking, open space systems, and recreational facilities. Also, this system may be permitted to meander through the development within prescribed sidewalk easements. If the sidewalk leaves the right-of-way, an easement and indemnification agreement must be provided for public access and maintenance.
4.
Schools, active parks, zoning overlay districts or from based code districts.
(i)
Sidewalks shall be required in subdivisions located within one-half mile of an existing or proposed school or active park on both sides of any street that provides access to such school or active park. Minor plats may be exempted from the requirement to provide sidewalks internal to the subdivision if the community development director determines that the public health, safety and welfare is protected and such exemption would be in the best interest of the City of Milton. Subdivisions at each side of the street shall provide sidewalks along the corresponding frontage in accordance with section 48-562.
(ii)
Sidewalks shall be provided where required within all zoning overlay districts and form based code districts as may be specified within those regulations.
5.
Sidewalks are needed in areas where the following nonresidential land use designations exist:
(i)
Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets in commercial, living-working, and business park land use designation areas.
(ii)
Sidewalks may be required in industrial subdivisions.
(iii)
Sidewalks may be required within a distance of up to one mile along both sides of the streets leading to or going through places of public assembly/transit facilities/other congested areas and other similar places deemed proper by the director of community development for public necessity and safety.
6.
Relation to established pattern of sidewalks. Notwithstanding the locational requirement for sidewalks in subsection (d)(2) of this section, their future location should follow the already established pattern of existing sidewalks (e.g., on one side of the street, on both sides, etc.).
(3)
General specifications.
a.
Sidewalks shall be provided by the subdivider at no cost to the city.
b.
Sidewalks shall have a minimum width of five feet indicated by a note on the preliminary plat.
c.
Sidewalks along roadways shall not be adjacent to street curbs without a minimum two-foot landscape strip.
d.
For nonresidential developments, sidewalks shall be a minimum of six feet wide.
e.
Sidewalks must be provided on or adjacent to an individual lot prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
f.
Prior to the recording of the final plat, 125 percent of the cost of the internal sidewalks for any residential subdivision must be performance bonded. This bond will be released when all sidewalks internal to the development have been constructed and approved. All required sidewalks must be provided internal to any residential subdivision within two years of the recording of the final plat, otherwise, the bond is forfeited and the city will use the funds to complete the sidewalk construction.
(4)
Review guidelines. The director of community development may issue guidelines to facilitate the application of the performance-based approach of subsection (d)(2) of this section including, but not limited to, a point system. The intent is to ascertain fairness and consistency in the application of this section.
(5)
Exception. When the developer requests to install (within a development) sidewalks that are not required by this chapter and at no cost to the city, the director of community development may approve a reduction to a minimum width of four feet.
(e)
Street trees. The required improvements for street trees shall be as follows:
(1)
Street trees and other shrubbery that may be retained or planted shall not obstruct sight distances and shall be subject to the director's approval.
(2)
Street trees that may be required by the director along the street shall be of a species approved as street trees in accordance with section 50-160.
