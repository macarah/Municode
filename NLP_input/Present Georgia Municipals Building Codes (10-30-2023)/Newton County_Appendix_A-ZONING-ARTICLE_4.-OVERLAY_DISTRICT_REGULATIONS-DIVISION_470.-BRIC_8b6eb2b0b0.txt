DIVISION 470. - BRICK STORE OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 470-000. - Application of district.
A.
The Brick Store Overlay District ("overlay") lies in the vicinity of the Brick Store Historic Site, in the areas surrounding the intersections of Interstate 20 and Highway 11, and Highway 11 and Highway 278. The individual parcels included can be seen on the map entitled "Newton County Brick Store Overlay District Tiers" contained in Appendix A, incorporated herein by reference thereto.
Brick Store Overlay District Tiers
B.
Except as otherwise provided, any new structures in the overlay are subject to the regulations contained herein.
C.
Existing structures are not subject to these regulations except to the extent required by section 470-050.
D.
In the approved Mt. Pleasant area (as shown on the Newton County Brick Store Overlay District Tiers map), the adopted plan as approved by the board of commissioners per REZ06-026 and REZ07-018 supersedes the overlay standards for standards addressed by the master plan submitted to Newton County on August 4, 2006, and referenced in the conditions of zoning for REZ06-026 and/or the conditions of zoning for REZ06-026 and REZ07-018. Where not addressed by said master plan and/or said conditions of zoning or where said conditions of zoning reference the rural village overlay, Tier 3 architectural and design standards shall apply to these properties.
E.
Except as otherwise stated herein, in any case where the standards and requirements of the overlay conflict with those of the remainder of the zoning ordinance, the standards and requirements of the overlay shall govern.
(Res. No. R041916d, exhs. A, B(470-000), 4-19-2016)
Sec. 470-010. - Purpose and intent.
In order to create a more livable Brick Store area, the overlay encourages the creation of clusters of close knit growth that keep the small town charm of Newton County. By focusing quality development within the overlay, the overlay sets the stage for preserving farmland and open space elsewhere in the county. It is the purpose of this section to create an overlay district that will:
1.
Promote the economic, cultural, educational, and general welfare of the public by fostering sustainable growth within key areas of the rural part of Newton County; preserve Newton County's rural ambiance and historic nature by avoiding the emergence and expansion of long, linear, commercial strips and by blending new developments into rural areas without compromising the unique character of these areas;
2.
Encourage compatibility of forms, scale, massing and materials such that new structures will conform to community features and standards and thereby more closely reflect the nature of the community.
(Res. No. R041916d, exh. B(470-010), 4-19-2016)
Sec. 470-020. - General requirements (all tiers).
A.
Tier planning and map. The overlay is divided into individual tiers which represent the different variations in use within the overlay. Tier 1 contains predominantly residential uses with appropriate neighborhood commercial uses that promote walkability. Tier 2 is a more intense commercial area promoting highway oriented development near I-20. Tier 3 provides for mixed-use town center style development. The following requirements apply to all properties within the overlay.
B.
Street requirements.
1.
Private streets (except for alleys) are prohibited.
2.
All roads shall be designed to meet all county requirements as well as follow the prescriptions in the table below. Deviations of no more than ten percent from the values listed may be approved by the director of development services provided any reduction does not impair the intent of the overlay and supports the concept of providing service for pedestrians, automobiles, and bicyclists.
3.
The county engineer shall determine the classification of new roads.
4.
Setbacks on Highway 11 are 100 feet for properties north of Highway 278, and 50 feet for properties south of Highway 278.

  C.
Sidewalk requirements.
1.
Sidewalks are required on both sides of all streets, except alleys, in accordance with the requirements of the road standards table.
2.
A pedestrian path at least five feet wide must be provided between the front entrance of a building and the nearest public sidewalk. Clearly marked pedestrian crossings shall be provided across any vehicular travel lane.
D.
Access management. All techniques described below shall be consistent with section 605-100 of Newton County Development Regulations.
1.
Traffic signals. Subject to review and approval of the county engineer and Georgia Department of Transportation, traffic signals may be required to be installed where curb cuts or new roads are connected to Highway 278 or Highway 11. Submittal of a signal warrant analysis and a traffic study may be required in making this determination.
2.
Curb cuts. The consolidation of curb cuts shall be required and new curb cuts shall be discouraged whenever appropriate, considering safe traffic flow, the objectives of the overlay and access points needed for the proper functioning of the use. A traffic study shall be required and approval of the county engineer, director, and Georgia Department of Transportation shall be obtained for any new curb cuts on Highway 11 or Highway 278. For parcels that abut Highway 278 or Highway 11, side streets are encouraged for main access points.
Curb cuts shall be determined by design speed as shown in the curb cut spacing table (except along state routes, which shall follow the Georgia Department of Transportation's Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control Manual). Minimum distances are measured between the centers of each intersection.

Note: Minimum distances are measured between the centers of each intersection.
  a.
Where new curb cuts are requested that do not meet the minimum spacing requirements, property owners shall pursue the use of joint driveways and cross-access drives. If the director determines based on documentation of a good faith effort that such action is not feasible, an exception shall be given.

Where possible, new curb cuts on one side of the street shall align with existing or proposed curb cuts on the opposite side of the street.
3.
Joint driveways. The use of joint driveways is required whenever possible as determined per subsection D.2. of this section. Driveways shall be constructed near property lines to allow for future joint driveways. Development adjacent to existing joint driveways or driveways within 20 feet of the property line are required to connect with the existing driveways provided the existing driveway meets the criteria for safe access and the owners can come to a legal agreement as in subsection D.5. of this section.
4.
Cross-access drives. Cross-access drives are required except between properties where the principal use is a single-family detached dwelling. Sidewalks shall be provided per the road standard table in subsection B of this section. Where cross-access drives cannot be connected to adjacent properties, a stub-out shall be provided. Properties constructing access roads adjacent to a property with an existing stub-out must connect to the existing stub-out. Cross-access drives shall not interfere with pedestrian connection to the primary structure.
5.
Legal requirements. Both joint driveways and cross-access drives shall meet the following requirements:
