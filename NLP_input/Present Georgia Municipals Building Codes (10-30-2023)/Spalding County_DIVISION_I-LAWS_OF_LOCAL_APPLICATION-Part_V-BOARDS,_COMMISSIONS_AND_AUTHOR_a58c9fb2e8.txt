Sec. 5.148. - Exclusion from consolidation.
Each of the Cities of Orchard Hill and Sunny Side shall have the right and option of being excluded from the consolidation provided for in this Act.

However, upon the refusal or failure of either such municipality to give timely written notice as set out in this Act of its election to exercise such option, or upon timely notice being given of the waiver of its right to exercise such option, as set out in this Act, such municipality shall thereafter be irrevocably included in the consolidation provided for in this Act.
