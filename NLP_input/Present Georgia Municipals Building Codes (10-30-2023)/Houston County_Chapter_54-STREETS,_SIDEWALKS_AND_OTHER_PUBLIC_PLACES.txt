Acceleration/deceleration lane requirements: Commercial driveways, except those permitted under item (a)(1), will normally include appropriate acceleration/deceleration lanes. Such lanes shall be constructed by the developer at no cost to the department or the county.
The right-of-way for such lanes shall be dedicated to the department or the county by the developer. The pavement sections for acceleration/deceleration lanes shall match that of the mainline. Acceleration/deceleration lanes may be required under item (a)(1), if they are considered necessary.
(e)
Left turn lanes at commercial driveways for mainline sections without a divided median: The department or county may require the construction of left turn lanes at commercial driveways for roadways of two, four or six lane sections and no divided median. The requirement will be based upon analyses of the capacity constraints imposed upon the roadway by left turns out of through traffic lanes giving consideration to current and 20-year projected traffic volumes.
(f)
Access conveyance: Once the number and configuration of driveways has been established, the developer of commercial property will be required to deed access control rights along his frontage to the department or county. For this purpose, commercial property includes residential subdivisions discussed under item 54-88(d).
(g)
Right-of-way conveyance: Developers of commercial property and residential property, as discussed under item 54-88(d) will be requested to deed right-of-way for future widening of the mainline highway where such is included in the department's or county's construction work program.

Comments shall address access to the state highway or county arterial or collector road. Possible solutions shall consider one, two or three connections (depending upon frontage) to an interior road system upon which the residential lots front, a frontage road parallel and adjacent to the state highway or county arterial or collector road upon which the lots will front which will also have connections to the state highway system or county arterial or collector road, or in extreme cases, a pairing of two lots per driveway. This latter circumstance is not desirable and should be a last resort settlement limited to frontage less than 100 feet.
Where a small number of large frontage lots are involved, individual driveways may be allowed at 250 feet on center. However, the county does not encourage curb cuts or driveways on arterial or collector roads.
(e)
Subdivision of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of the tract shall be handled as private residences.
