The county clerk and the county administrator may be included in any executive session approved by the board of commissioners, unless expressly barred either by the chair or by not less than three members of the board of commissioners present during the course of an executive session. The county attorney (or other attorney authorized by the county attorney representing the board) must be included in any executive session. Other individuals may be invited to participate in an executive session, either at the invitation of the chair or with the consent of not less than three members of the board of commissioners present during the course of the executive session, but only if the presence of such individuals is consistent with the applicable exception authorizing the executive session. No other individuals shall be permitted in the executive session.

(h)
Discussion of executive session business. Commissioners, officials, employees, and other individuals who attend executive sessions are prohibited from discussing or in any other way disclosing confidential information, legal advice and/or legal strategy discussed in the executive session unless:
(1)
The disclosure is required by law; or
(2)
The disclosure is part of a judicial or administrative proceeding.
This subsection shall not prevent a county attorney (or other authorized attorney representing the board) from discussing any matters discussed in executive session relative to settlement or negotiation of a lawsuit or other claim against the county.
