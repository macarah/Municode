No board member shall be required to be a resident of the district or of Forsyth County.
Section 6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2Â½ percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specifically required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to Forsyth County as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Forsyth County in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Forsyth County. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Forsyth County ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of 1 percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Forsyth County to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the taxes provided for in subsection (a) of this section between January 1 and June 1 of each calendar year and notify in writing the Forsyth County Tax Commissioner by June 15 each year so that he may include the levy on his regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If a parcel of real property is removed from the district or otherwise would become nontaxable it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
Section 7. - Boundaries of the districts.
The boundaries of the district shall be designated by the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County in the resolution required in Section 4 of this Act.
Section 8. - Debt.
The district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Article IX, Section V of the Constitution of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district.
Section 9. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board of the district and the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Forsyth County to provide services or facilities within the district; and Forsyth County shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within the district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the county. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided in the district.

(h)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.

Issuance by the board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other project; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
(d)
Upon the final repayment of any and all bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district issued under this Act, the board shall make an offer to convey all property and facilities of the board and district to Forsyth County.
