Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the county.
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
Impervious surface means manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.

Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the Drastic methodology. (state department of natural resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.)
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river.
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.

River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440—12-5-457, or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the upper most part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.

(Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 3)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 30-74. - Groundwater recharge area protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection district is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition). Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Such maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
(d)
Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(1)
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
a.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and
c.
Low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the national resource and conservation service.
(3)
New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual:
a.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area, 150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated;
b.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area, 125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated; and
c.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area, 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated.
(4)
New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on DHR Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual.
a.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area, 150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated;
b.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area, 125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated; and
c.
Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area, 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated.
(5)
No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the DHR manual and subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section.
(6)
New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements.

Notes to tables
EXPAND
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B. The Baldwin County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
  EXPAND
X =   5,000 gal/day
1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres x 43,560ft 2 /acre
= 181,500ft 2 area of land needed.
  Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
EXPAND
Y =  5,000 gal/day
600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres x 43,560ft 2 /acre
= 363,000ft area of land needed.
  (e)
Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsection (d)(3) and (4) of this section.
(Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 4)
Sec. 30-75. - Wetlands protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
(c)
District delineation.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto.
(2)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) of this section shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(e)
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(f)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetlands protection district:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
(Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 5)
Sec. 30-76. - Water supply watershed protection district.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(2)
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the county.
(b)
Establishment of water supply watershed protection districts. The Oconee Water Supply Watershed Districts are hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the city of water supply intakes. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map of the county. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. The following water supply watershed districts are hereby defined, and the boundaries shall be identified on the water supply watershed protection district map: The Oconee Watershed is a large water supply watershed. The intakes for the city are located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir.
(c)
Protection criteria. The following regulations shall apply to the Oconee Water Supply Watershed identified on the adopted map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir: New facilities, located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir, which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements or the requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code.
(d)
Exemptions. The following uses shall be exempted:
(1)
Land uses existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(2)
Mining activities permitted by the department of natural resources under the Surface Mining Act.
(3)
Utilities from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions in accordance with the following conditions if the utilities to be located in the buffer or setback areas cannot feasibly be located outside these areas:
a.
The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible.
b.
The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible.
c.
The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
(4)
Specific forestry and agricultural activities in the stream corridor buffer and setback areas in accordance with the following conditions:
a.
The activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission or the state department of agriculture.
b.
The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
(Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 6)
Sec. 30-77. - River corridor protection district.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(2)
The Oconee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Oconee River.
(b)
Establishment of Oconee River corridor protection district. The Oconee River corridor protection district is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Oconee River within the county and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Oconee River corridor protection district map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
(c)
Protection criteria.
(1)
Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided in this article.
(2)

For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river, (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size).
c.
There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land.
d.
A septic tank or tanks serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.
e.
Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area.
(6)

All persons or firms harvesting standing timber in any unincorporated area of Baldwin County for delivery as pulpwood, logs, poles, posts, or wood chips to any woodyard or processing plant located inside or outside this state shall provide Notice of such harvesting operations to the Baldwin County Governing Authority or the designated agent thereof prior to entering onto the property if possible, but in no event later than 24 hours after entering onto the property. Further, such persons shall give Notice of cessation of cutting within 24 hours after the job is completed.
(b)
The notice of harvesting operations required by this Ordinance shall be provided for each separate tract to be harvested. Such notice shall be made in such form as prescribed by rule or regulation of the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission, and shall include the following information:
(1)
A map of the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested and, as to those trucks which will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, the main point of ingress to such tract from a public road and, if different, the main point of egress from such tract to a public road. If multiple points of ingress and/or ingress will be used, all such points shall be identified;

The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest; and
(4)
The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber.
(c)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the notice required by this section may be submitted in person, by transmission of an electronic record via telefacsimile or e-mail, or by mail.
(d)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, upon notification published by the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission that a state-wide notification website or platform is available for public use, persons or firms wishing to utilize said website or platform to provide the notice required by this section may do so at their option, and Baldwin County will accept notifications submitted in this manner.
(e)
On and after a date specified and published by the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission, use of the state-wide notification website or platform shall be mandatory and shall be the sole means of providing the notice required by this section; on and after said date submission of the notice by any of the means listed in subsection (c) of this section above shall cease and will no longer be deemed acceptable or in compliance with this section.
(f)
The notice required by this section shall not be or remain effective unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the governing authority of the county or its designated agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting Baldwin County against any damage caused by such person or firm in the amount of $5,000.00; provided, however, that at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of $5,000.00 may be provided in lieu of a surety bond. Such bonds or letters of credit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this Ordinance. No more than one bond or letter of credit shall be required from each person or firm harvesting timber, regardless of the number of tracts harvested in the county for so long as the bond or letter of credit remains in effect. The bond or letter of credit required herein shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it was delivered.
(g)
The bond or letter of credit required by subsection (f) of this section shall protect Baldwin County against any damage requiring re-ditching or repair of existing ditch structures or the removal of any harvesting residue, including tree tops, debris, logs, pulpwood and other materials, placed in or around the county's rights-of-way caused by such person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights-of-way. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall also be available to reimburse the county for any costs incurred to maintain or repair county roads damaged by the ingress or egress of motor vehicles engaged in the harvest operations located within 500 feet of any point of ingress or egress of the timber harvesting operation. The right of the county to call such bond or letter of credit in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section shall be in addition to any other remedies available to the county at law or in equity for damage to county roads or rights-of-way.
(h)
When damage results from a person or firm's harvesting activities, the governing authority of the County shall make and provide a written claim to the person or firm causing the damage within 30 business days after the governing authority becomes aware of the damage. Such claim may be given in person, by telefacsimile, email or mail. The claim shall describe the damage in detail and, in compliance with subsection (i)(1) of this section, give the person or firm the opportunity to repair such damage within 30 days of the notification; provided, however, the county shall be authorized to repair the damage immediately if the governing authority or its designee determines the conditions present a threat to public safety, health or welfare and, upon making such repairs, shall present to the person or firm and the issuer of the applicable bond or letter of credit an itemized list of expenses incurred as a claim against the responsible party and the issuer of its bond or letter of credit. Upon the issuance of a claim as provided in this section the governing authority of the county or its designee shall notify the issuer of the bond or letter of credit that a claim has been made and will be resolved or adjudicated according to the terms of this section.
(i)
Within 30 days of receipt of the written claim described in subsection (h) of this section, the person or firm against whom the claim is submitted may:
(1)
Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the governing authority of the county or its designee. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of the governing authority or its designee, the governing authority or its designee shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.
(2)
In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30-day extension to repair the damage from the governing authority of the county, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered. Approval of any extension shall be at the discretion of the governing authority of the county or its designee.
(3)
Appeal the claim to the Magistrate Court of Baldwin County. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The magistrate court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, required by subsection (h) of this section. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the county the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the governing authority of Baldwin County shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(4)
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsections (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection (i) within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.
(j)
If the person or firm tendering a bond or letter of credit pursuant to the requirements of this section continues its timber harvesting operation beyond the calendar year in which the bond or letter of credit was issued, the person or firm continuing the timber harvesting operation shall tender a new bond or letter of credit within five business days after the first day of the new calendar year.
(k)
In the event a bond or letter of credit tendered pursuant to the requirements of this section is revoked by the surety or bank, then a valid replacement bond or letter of credit must be delivered to the governing authority of the county within five business days after the date of revocation in order for timber harvesting operations to continue. In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The maximum amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not exceed $10,000.00.
(l)
Submission of the notice required by this section shall authorize the person or firm submitting same to undertake the timber harvesting operation described in the notice and shall remain in effect until such time as the person or firm gives Notice that the harvesting operation is complete; provided, however, that any change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such Notice, including, but not limited to, a change in the scope or extent of the operation, must be reported to the governing authority of the county within three business days after such change.
(m)
Any person or firm that engages in a timber harvesting operation in the unincorporated portion of Baldwin County without complying with the notice requirements of this section shall be subject to a citation and trial, and upon conviction shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,500.00 for each violation.
(n)
This section applies to activities which qualify as forestry land management practices or agricultural operations under O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 (5) and (6) on land that is zoned for or used for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural purposes. It shall not authorize land disturbing activities incidental to development in conflict with the limitations set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 (6).
(o)
Consistent with O.C.G.A. § 12-6-24:
(1)
No fee shall be charged to provide and submit the Notice required by this section; and
(2)
No permit, including a driveway permit, shall be required of the person or firm engaged in a timber harvesting operation as defined by said Code section. Persons and firms providing the notice required by this section may be asked to consult with county officials responsible for roads and public works for the purpose of minimizing damage to the county's roads, rights of way and infrastructure, and are urged to follow recommendations from county officials. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the person or firm conducting the timber harvest operation bears ultimate responsibility for their actions, and nothing in this section shall preclude the governing authority of Baldwin County from taking any and all legal action necessary to protect its property and the health, safety and welfare of its citizens.
