Sec. 6-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This chapter is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This chapter is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This chapter is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
