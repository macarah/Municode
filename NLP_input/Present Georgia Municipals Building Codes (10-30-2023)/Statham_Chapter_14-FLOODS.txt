Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered "new construction."
Appeal means a request for a review of the interpretation of any provision of this article.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in Section 14-25.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment.
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the first floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the City as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(1)
Overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
(2)
Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.
Historic structure means any structure that is:

(1)
The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
(2)
The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
(3)
Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(4)
The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the Code Enforcement Officer, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

(Code 2006, § 30-19; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 6)
Sec. 14-20. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Code 2006, § 30-20; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 14-21. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(4)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Code 2006, § 30-21; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 14-22. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Code 2006, § 30-22; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 1, § D)
Sec. 14-23. - Variance procedures.
(a)
The Mayor and Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The Mayor and Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Mayor and Council in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Mayor and Council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally-dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the Mayor and Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is a:
a.
Finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The Mayor and Council shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Mayor and Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 14-80. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
(2)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
(3)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(4)
All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
a.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
3.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
b.
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area.
c.
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(5)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
(6)
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces.
(7)
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
(8)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
(9)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(10)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not complaint with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Code 2006, § 30-71; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 4, § A)
Sec. 14-81. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 14-80(4).
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Section 14-53(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on:
1.
Individual lots or parcels;
2.
In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
3.
In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
4.
On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;
must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system, as stated in Section 14-80(6), to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
2.
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of Subsections (3)a through c of this section.
(4)
Floodway. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14-25 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided that it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Only if Subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.
(Code 2006, § 30-72; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 4, § B)
Sec. 14-82. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones).
(a)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14-25, wherever streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 14-25, then the Code Enforcement Officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, State, or other sources, in order to administer the provisions of this division; only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of Subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply.
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Section 14-80(4).
(b)
The Code Enforcement Officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(Code 2006, § 30-73; Ord. of 7-27-2004, art. 4, § C)
Sec. 14-83. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14-25 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 14-80(4). The Code Enforcement Officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
