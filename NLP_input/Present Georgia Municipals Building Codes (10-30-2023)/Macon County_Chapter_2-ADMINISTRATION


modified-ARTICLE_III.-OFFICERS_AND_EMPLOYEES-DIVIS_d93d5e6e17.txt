DIVISION 8. - GRIEVANCE AND APPEALS NOT INVOLVING ADVERSE ACTIONS

Sec. 2-255. - Purpose.
The purpose of the employee grievance procedure is to provide an orderly process for hearing the grievable claims of both regular and working test employees. The object of the process is to reach a fair and equitable decision in a timely manner. The employee and supervisor should make an effort to resolve any grievance informally before initiating a formal procedure.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.01)
Sec. 2-256. - Definition.
A grievance is a claim initiated by an employee alleging that the employee's employment or productivity has been adversely affected by:
(1)
Unfair treatment;
(2)
Unsafe or unhealthy working conditions;
(3)
Erroneous or capricious application of county policies and procedures; or
(4)
Unlawful discrimination.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.02)
Sec. 2-257. - Steps.
(a)
Normally, a grievance procedure will provide for a minimum of two steps. When practical, an attempt will be made to provide at least two steps to a grievance. However, the organizational structure of the county may, as a practical matter, prevent all grievances from receiving two steps. The following represents the order of the maximum grievance levels for employees:
(1)
Supervisor.
(2)
Department head.
(3)
County manager or constitutional officer.
(b)
In cases where a grievable claim is not resolved to the employee's satisfaction at the highest applicable available grievance level and if it is an appealable matter (see sections 2-259 and 2-260), the employee may request another hearing. Such additional hearing will be conducted by action of the county commissioners who may further determine the facts in the case. The county commissioners may then elect to modify the county manager's decision or may elect to let the original decision stand. This decision should be final. There shall be no appeal to the county commission of any decision made by a constitutional officer.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.03)
Sec. 2-258. - Grievance filing process.
(a)
An employee may file a written grievance with the employee's department head or supervisor within 15 days after the occurrence of the event being grieved, or within 15 days after becoming aware of the event. The grievance statement must be submitted to the department head/supervisor in writing, and it should state the specific claim and the specific relief desired.
(b)
Scheduling and notification. If the claim is determined to be grievable by department head or supervisor, a hearing by the department head should be held within 20 days after the grievance is filed. The hearing officer (department head/supervisor) should notify the employee of the decision in writing within 15 days after the initial decision and inform the employee that the employee may request a further hearing before the county manager or the appropriate constitutional officer.
(c)
The employee must, within five days of notification of the decision of the first hearing officer (department head/supervisor), request a grievance consultation with the county manager or constitutional officer.
(d)
If a second hearing is requested, the county manager or constitutional officer should schedule and notify the employee of the date of the hearing, hold the hearing, and render a decision within ten days of the date of the hearing. If the decision is not in favor of the employee (and if it is an appealable matter), the notification should include a statement that the employee may be allowed to request a hearing before the county commissioners. (See section 2-260.)
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.04)
Sec. 2-259. - Grievance hearings.
(a)
First level (and second level, if available). Grievance hearings at these two levels are semi-formal in nature. The hearing officer should listen to the employee's presentation and question the employee to obtain pertinent facts about the claim and the situation relevant to the claim. The employee may self-represent, but may bring witnesses to the hearing to testify. Both the employee and the hearing officer may question the witnesses. (These are information sessions and under no circumstances should they be allowed to become adversarial in nature.)
(b)
Appeal hearing by the county commissioners. If a hearing before the county commissioners is held on appealable grievances, both the employee and the county manager may represent themselves or may choose to have an attorney. The county commissioners should compile evidence, prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issue a decision. The decision will be final.
(c)
Any hearing or appeals provided to employees should not be interpreted as an exercise of judicial power. They are merely voluntary compliance with forms of judicial process.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.05)
Sec. 2-260. - Non-grievable areas.
The following are not grievable:
(1)
Issues which are pending, or have been concluded by other administrative or judicial procedures.
(2)
Work assignments which do not result in a demotion.
(3)
Budget allocations and expenditures, and organizational structure, including the persons or number of persons assigned to particular jobs or units.
(4)
The content or rating of a performance appraisal except when the employee can show that the employee has been adversely affected by the appraisal.
(5)
The selection of an individual by the appointing authority or designee to fill a position through appointment, promotion, or transfer except when the employee can show that the employee has been adversely affected because of unlawful discrimination.
(6)
Any matter which is not within the jurisdiction or control of the appointing authority.
(7)
Internal security practices established by the appointing authority.
(8)
Decisions, policies, practices, resolutions, or ordinances made or passed by the governing authority or the appointing authority which are not job or work related and which do not contradict these policies.
(9)
Disciplinary actions other than reprimands.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.06)
Sec. 2-261. - Appeals.
(a)
As stated in division 7 of this article, an employee may appeal an adverse action. Additionally, employees may appeal certain other personnel actions that adversely affect an employee provided that the claim must be grieved before it is appealed. These include:
(1)
Unlawful discrimination against an employee;
(2)
Unlawful or unjust coercion or reprisal; and
(3)
Other unlawful or unjust practices that adversely affect an employee.
(b)
Any appeals or hearings provided to employees should not be interpreted as an exercise of judicial power. Such hearings are merely voluntary compliances with forms of judicial procedures.
(Mo. of 12-4-2007, § 8.07)
Secs. 2-262—2-285. - Reserved.
