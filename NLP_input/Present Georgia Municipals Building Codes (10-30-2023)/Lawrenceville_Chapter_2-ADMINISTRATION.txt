Hearings and determinations. A name clearing hearing shall be held as described in the City Personnel Policy.
(b)
Code of Ethics for City Officials.
(1)
Principal policies. The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest, which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office or position to unethically improve their own private standing. The principal policies that form the foundation of this Code of Ethics are as follows:
a.
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
b.
The constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Lawrenceville should be upheld as a minimum standard of conduct.
c.
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
d.
City Officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.
e.
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.
(2)
Intent. It is the intent of this Code of Ethics that City officials shall not knowingly engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their official duties or which would tend to impair their judgment or actions in the performance of their official duties. Furthermore, City Officials should avoid any action that might result in or create the appearance of:
a.
Using public office or position in an unethical manner for private gain;
b.
Impeding City efficiency or economy; or
c.
Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the City.
(3)
Definitions. As used in this section, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed to them below (unless otherwise required by context):
a.
Benefit means anything of monetary value that a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence a City Official in the performance or non-performance of an official action.
b.
Confidential information means information which has been obtained in the course of holding public office, employment, an independent contract or otherwise acting as a public servant, and which information is not available to members of the public under the Georgia Open Records Act or other law or regulation and which the public servant is not authorized to disclose, including:
1.
Any written information that could lawfully be exempted from disclosure pursuant to State law, unless the public servant disclosing it is authorized to do so by State law, or pursuant to some other pertinent law, policy or procedure;
2.
Any non-written information which, if it were written, could be excepted from disclosure under State law, unless the public servant disclosing it is authorized to do so by the State law, or pursuant to some other pertinent law, policy or procedure; and
3.
Information which was obtained in the course of or by means of a record or oral report of a lawful executive or closed session, whether or not the disclosure of the information would violate State law, unless the public servant disclosing it is authorized by State law to do so, or unless the public servant disclosing it has been properly authorized to disclose it pursuant to an applicable law, policy or procedure; however, when such information is also available through channels which are open to the public, this provision does not prohibit public servants from disclosing the availability of those channels.

Entity means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, firm, corporation, professional corporation, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any other entity recognized by law through which business may be conducted.

0.010 = 10 mills or 1 cent = 1%
0.100 = 100 mills or 10 cents = 10%
(2)
Millage is determined by dividing the total amount of money to be raised by the total assessed value of the Municipality.
Example:
Taxes needed: $100,000.00
Assessed value: $8,000,000.00
$100,000.00 = 0.0125 or 12½ mills; or
$8,000,000.00 = 1.25% or assessed valuation.
Taxes receivable means the uncollected portion of taxes which a governmental unit has levied.

(b)
Invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement.
(c)
Public notice. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. Such notice may include publication in a newspaper of general circulation a reasonable time prior to the bid opening. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of the bid opening.
(d)
Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the City unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the Purchasing Department by the date and time specified in the Invitation to Bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the City.
(e)
Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded. The record shall be open to public inspection in accordance with state law.
(f)
Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this article. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability, such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation unless it is set forth in the invitation for bids.
(g)
Correction or withdrawal of bids; cancellation of awards. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for the bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
(1)
The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
(2)
The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure.
All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the Purchasing Manager.
(h)
Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the Purchasing Manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Any such negotiated adjustment shall be based only upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for bids.
(i)
Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(j)
Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local firm if only one of the bidders has a current City business license and office located within the boundaries of the City of Lawrenceville. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local firms, the Purchasing staff shall request the firms' best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid. If both firms have the same price after best and final offer, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by Purchasing staff in a public session. Bidders will be invited to attend and one or more witnesses may be present.
(k)
Approval by City Council. All contracts exceeding $100,000.00 shall be approved by City Council.

(b)
Public notice. Public notice shall be advertised as required by Georgia law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item or service to be purchased, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal receipt.

(c)
Receipt. No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the City unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the Purchasing Department by the date and time specified in the Request for Proposals.

The City of Lawrenceville is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq. and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted in any response. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary."
(f)
Evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the Request for Proposals. With the approval of the Purchasing Associate named in the solicitation, the evaluating team may communicate with each proposer to clarify and amplify each Proposer's proposal. No information concerning any other Proposer's proposal shall be communicated in any way to the Proposer. Additional information may be requested of Proposers. The Purchasing Department will initiate such requests.
(g)
Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals. As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to ensure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
(h)
Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.
(i)
Approval by City Council. All contracts exceeding $100,000.00 shall be approved by the City Council.

Sec. 2-257. - Informal purchases.
Amended by Ordinance No. 2022-1
(a)
Conditions for Use. Those purchases anticipated to be under $100,000.00 that do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals. The Purchasing Manager is authorized to establish the methods and procedures to be used in handling informal purchases such as, but not limited to, telephone requests, e-mail requests, or informal written requests. Unless otherwise specifically provided, such purchases will be obtained competitively through informal written solicitations.
(b)
General. Procurements that involve amounts less than $100,000.00 do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the City. The formal sealed bid/proposal process may still be exercised with an informal purchase if deemed in the best interest of the City.
(c)
Prohibition of improper use. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals or applicable approvals.
(d)
Small purchases between 1,000.00 and $5,000.00. Insofar as it is practical for small purchases between $1,000.00 and $5,000.00, no less than three businesses shall be solicited to submit quotations unless adequate source supply is not available. Award shall be made to the business offering the lowest acceptable quotation. The names of the businesses submitting quotations, and the date and amount of each quotation, shall be recorded and maintained as a public record.
(e)
Small purchases of $1,000.00 or less. The City Manager shall adopt operational procedures for making small purchases of $1,000.00 or less. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records adequate to document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended, and facilitate an audit of the small purchases made.
(f)
Approval by City Council. Regardless of procurement method, all purchases exceeding $100,000.00 shall be approved by City Council. Once the purchase has been approved by the City Council, all expenditures made in accordance with the terms of the purchase are approved and shall require no further action by the City Council. Provided however that the Stormwater Authority is authorized to approve all stormwater projects up to $300,000.00.
(g)
Approval by City Manager. Regardless of procurement method, all purchases between $5,000.00 and $100,000.00 shall be approved by the City Manager or his/her designee.

DIVISION 2. - PROCUREMENT FOR FEDERAL AID HIGHWAY PROGRAM FUNDING PROJECTS

Sec. 2-278. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the City of Lawrenceville Policy for Competitive Negotiation Qualifications-based Selection for Projects Using Federal Aid Highway Program (FAHP) Funding.
( Ord. No. 2018-6, 5-7-2018 )
Sec. 2-279. - General policy.
(a)
Competitive negotiation. Except as provided in sections 2-280 and 2-281, the City shall use the competitive negotiation method for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract (as specified in 23 U.S.C. § 112(b)(2)(A)). The solicitation, evaluation, ranking, selection, and negotiation shall comply with the qualifications-based selection procurement procedures for architectural and engineering services codified under 40 U.S.C. §§ 1101—1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act.
(b)
Application of competitive negotiation method procedures. In accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act, the following procedures shall apply to the competitive negotiation procurement method:
(1)
Solicitation. The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-State and out-of-State consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and request for proposals are then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby statements of qualifications are submitted on an annual basis. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under an RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications.
(2)
Request for proposal (RFP). The RFP shall provide all information and requirements necessary for interested consultants to provide a response to the RFP and compete for the solicited services. The RFP shall:
a.
Provide a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the scope of work, technical requirements, and qualifications of consultants necessary for the services to be rendered. The scope of work should detail the purpose and description of the project, services to be performed, deliverables to be provided, estimated schedule for performance of the work, and applicable standards, specifications, and policies;
b.
Identify the requirements for any discussions that may be conducted with three or more of the most highly qualified consultants following submission and evaluation of proposals;
c.
Identify evaluation factors including their relative weight of importance in accordance with subsection (c) of this section;
d.
Specify the contract type and method(s) of payment to be utilized in accordance with 23 CFR 172.9;
e.
Identify any special provisions or contract requirements associated with the solicited services;
f.
Require that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals as these shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase; and
g.
Provide a schedule of key dates for the procurement process and establish a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP which provides sufficient time for interested consultants to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances shall be not less than 14 days from the date of issuance of the RFP.
(3)
Evaluation factors.
a.
Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance.
b.
Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria.
c.
In-state or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement which attests to the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services.
d.
The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of ten percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection:
1.
A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria.
2.
The participation of qualified and certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 CFR Part 26 and the City of Lawrenceville's FHWA-approved DBE program.
(4)
Evaluation, ranking, and selection.
a.
Consultant proposals shall be evaluated by the City based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation.
b.
While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime consultant and any sub-consultants identified within the proposal with respect to the scope of work and established criteria.
c.
Following submission and evaluation of proposals, the City shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions determined three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP. Discussion requirements shall be specified within the RFP and should be based on the size and complexity of the project as defined in City written policies and procedures (as specified in 23 CFR 172.5(c)). Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview. Discussions following proposal submission are not required provided proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria.
d.
From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the City shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria.
e.
Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants.
f.
The City shall retain acceptable documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and selection of the consultant accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.42.
(5)
Negotiation.
a.
Independent estimate. Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the City shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost.
b.
Elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fee, and other direct costs) shall be established separately in accordance with 23 CFR 172.11.
c.
If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated may be considered. Concealed cost proposals of consultants with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective consultant due to the confidential nature of this data (as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(E)).
d.
The City shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.42. This documentation shall include the consultant cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of the indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract (as specified in 23 CFR 172.11(c)).
( Ord. No. 2018-6, 5-7-2018 )
Sec. 2-280. - Informal purchases.
The informal purchase method involves procurement of engineering and design related services where an adequate number of qualified sources are reviewed and the total contract costs do not exceed the established informal purchase threshold. The City may use the State's small purchase procedures which reflect applicable State laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the Federal simplified acquisition threshold (as specified in 48 CFR 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in State law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method:
(1)
The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures.
(2)
A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed.
(3)
Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with State small purchase procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
(4)
The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold would be ineligible for Federal-aid funding. The FHWA may withdraw all Federal-aid from a contract if it is modified or amended above the applicable established simplified acquisition threshold.
( Ord. No. 2018-6, 5-7-2018 )
Sec. 2-281. - Noncompetitive.
The noncompetitive method involves procurement of engineering and design related services when it is not feasible to award the contract using competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement methods. The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method:
(1)
The City may use their own noncompetitive procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable Federal requirements.
(2)
The City shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from, the FHWA before using this form of contracting.
(3)
Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive procedures are limited to the following:
a.
The service is available only from a single source;
b.
There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or
c.
After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate.
(4)
Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with the City noncompetitive procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the Federal cost principles.
( Ord. No. 2018-6, 5-7-2018 )
Sec. 2-282. - Additional procurement requirements.
(a)
Common grant rule.
(1)
The City must comply with procurement requirements established in State and local laws, regulations, policies, and procedures which are not addressed by or in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations (as specified in 49 CFR 18.36).
(2)
When State and local procurement laws, regulations, policies, or procedures are in conflict with applicable Federal laws and regulations, the City of Lawrenceville must comply with Federal requirements to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement of the associated costs of the services incurred following FHWA authorization (as specified in 49 CFR 18.4).
(b)
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program.
(1)
The City shall give consideration to DBE consultants if required by the use of state and federal funds in the procurement of engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR 26. When DBE program participation goals cannot be met through race-neutral measures, additional DBE participation on engineering and design related services contracts may be achieved in accordance with the City of Lawrenceville's FHWA approved DBE program through either:
a.
Use of an evaluation criterion in the qualifications-based selection of consultants (as specified in 23 CFR 172.7(a)(1)(iii)(D)); or
b.
Establishment of a contract participation goal.
(2)
The use of quotas or exclusive set-asides for DBE consultants is prohibited (as specified in 49 CFR 26.43).
(c)
Suspension and debarment. The City must verify suspension and debarment actions and eligibility status of consultants and sub-consultants prior to entering into an agreement or contract in accordance with 49 CFR 18.35 and 2 CFR 180.
