Private streets permitted. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the city council within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the city council at the time of preliminary plat approval by the planning commission. Following a recommendation by the planning commission to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the city council shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section.
(b)
Engineering plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street, or to cause the same to be done, without first obtaining approval of engineering and construction plans from the planning commission and city council in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(c)
Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by article II of this chapter, applicable construction specifications of the city engineer, and as approved by the planning commission and city council.
(d)
Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the director. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the director. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the director to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field.
(e)
Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general-purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall at minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan and the city for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either:
(1)
Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or
(2)
Be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot).
(f)
Maintenance. The city shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the county clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms:
(1)
The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision of seven or more lots fronting on a private street.
(2)
The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule.
(3)
The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street.
(4)
The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street.
(5)
The covenant shall run with the land.
(6)
The city council may, at their discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners association, or the city council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the city engineer into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise.
(g)
Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The director shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat:
(1)
Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section.
(2)
The following warning:
"WARNING, City of Young Harris has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat."
(3)
A grant of easement, as follows:
"Grant of Easement. The general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) is hereby granted, and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the city, and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, water lines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines.
___________
Signature of Property Owner."
(4)
The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the city council waive the dedication requirement.
"Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to the city of Young Harris.
___________
Signature of Property Owner."
(h)
Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale, or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the city, the subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot:
"Purchaser's Acknowledgement of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility
(I)/(We) have read the Declaration of Covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction ___________ (insert address or attach legal description). (I)/(We) understand that the Declaration of Covenant applies to the lot that (I am)/(we are) purchasing and requires (me)/(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the construction and maintenance of any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)/(we are) purchasing, and that owners of other lots in this plat may sue for and recover those costs which this covenant requires (me)/(us) to pay, plus their damages resulting from (my)/(our) refusal to contribute, plus reasonable attorneys' fees.

Sec. 22-48. - Curb cuts and access specifications.
(a)
Entrance improvement specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lanes and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the city, in accordance with state or city specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the city prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any city street shall be approved by the city prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits.
(b)
Curb cut specifications.
(1)
No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line unless the adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained from the city. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the city. The city may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public.
a.
The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; sight distances; and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.
(c)
Access along and near divided highways. Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met (see Figure 2.9.1):
EXPAND
Minimum Access Separation Requirements Distance

(d)
Interparcel connections. New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip (see Figure 2.9.2).
Figure 2.9.2. Minimum Access Spacing Along and Near Divided Highway
(e)
Access to abutting public roads. There shall be one entrance providing direct access from a subdivision to existing abutting collector streets for every 200 residential dwelling units within the subdivision. Where subdivisions consist of multiple phases, the number of residential lots in all of the phases together shall be used to determine the appropriate number of entrances. Individual lots of a subdivision may not directly access existing state, county, or city streets or roadways. If there are more than 200 residences and a second access to an existing collector road is not available or, in the opinion of the city engineer, could induce nonresidential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed. However, such single entrance must be designed with the necessary traffic control and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements including protected left-turn lanes to provide for the safe and efficient operation of the intersection, subject to the approval of the city.

(Ord. of 4-1-2010, ยง 2.13)
Sec. 22-53. - Drainage and stormwater management.
(a)
General requirements. An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The city may require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The planning commission shall not approve any preliminary plat of a subdivision that does not make adequate provision for storm and flood water runoff channels or basins as determined by the city engineer. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision, or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and stormwater management.
(b)
Method of design and capacity. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the CSC Method, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a ten-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catch basin, inlets cross drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works.
(c)
Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. Catch basins shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road.
(d)
Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Stormwater shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body.
(e)
Grading and site drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials.
(f)
Cross drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by the city engineer. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than one percent.
(g)
Drop inlets. Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless otherwise specified by the city engineer.
(h)
Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainageway crosses a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the city. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least 20 feet shall be provided, or greater as required by law.
(Ord. of 4-1-2010, ยง 2.14)
Sec. 22-54. - Water.
(a)
Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply.
(b)
Water main requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to specifications of the city. All water mains shall normally be at least six inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters Association. Pipe of less than four inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Water lines shall be installed at least 30 inches below grade. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise specifically provided.
(c)
Wells. If a county and/or municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. In subdivisions or land developments with a residential density of one unit per acre or less, and when a public water system is not available as determined by the city, individual wells may be used in a manner so that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision or to the land development. When individual wells are proposed to be used for water supply, water samples shall be submitted to the county health department for its approval, and individual wells shall be approved by the county health department. Approvals shall be submitted to the code enforcement officer prior to final subdivision plat approval.
(d)
Community water system. If a county and/or municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. Any community water system, if permitted, shall provide a minimum flow of 400 gallons per day per each lot platted, whether or not each lot is to be immediately developed; shall be sanitary; and shall have a minimum pressure of 30 pounds per square inch at each lot in the subdivision or each land development to be served. For all common non-public water supply systems, acceptable management, maintenance, and distribution policies and procedures shall be established. These policies and procedures shall be required to guarantee the provision of adequate supplies to each perspective lot owner on a continuing, ongoing basis, and to provide acceptable means for repairs and unforeseen events. The community water system plan shall be approved by the county health department, and a letter of approval from the state department of natural resources shall accompany the final plat or land development application.
(e)
Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all subdivisions except those permitted to be served by individual on-site wells. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the county fire department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the fire department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities.
(Ord. of 4-1-2010, ยง 2.15)
Sec. 22-55. - Sewer.
(a)
Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. Each subdivision and land development shall be served by adequate sewage disposal facilities. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision, or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment.
(b)
Connection to public sewerage system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, as determined by the city, the subdivider or land developer shall connect with same and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. The term "reasonably accessible" means a connection available on a public right-of-way within 300 feet of the subject development. If a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, it shall be unlawful to maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is not immediately accessible but is anticipated by the city to be available within a period of three years, the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision or land development boundary so that a future connection with the public sewer main can be made. The city may condition the approval of a subdivision or land development on the agreement to connect to the public sewerage system upon its availability. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two manholes of 400 feet, unless otherwise specified by standards of the city. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than 0.7 percent for eight-inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-foot wide easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines.
(c)
Alternative provision. If sanitary sewer is not available at the time of the development of the subdivision or land development, and if sanitary sewer is not anticipated to be available within a period of three years to serve the subdivision or land development in question, then on-site septic tanks, an oxidation pond, or another approved method of treatment of sanitary sewerage shall be installed by and at the expense of the subdivider, land developer, or lot purchaser, in conformity with the requirements of the county health department and according to specifications adopted by the city. Low pressure sewer systems (systems with grinders or pumps at each individual household) are not permitted.
(d)
Septic tanks. Where individual on-site wastewater disposal systems are allowed and proposed, individual lot sizes and shapes must exhibit appropriate regard for the peculiar health, drainage, and maintenance characteristics on the site. Additionally, detailed soil tests may be required in order to verify the ability of the lots to safely contain and dispose of septic system effluent. All septic tanks and on-site wastewater disposal systems are subject to the approval of the county health department. Minimum lot size shall be as required by the health department.

Sec. 22-56. - Utilities.
(a)
Placement of utilities. All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision or land development. Whenever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except when existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground. Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities, private and public, and such easements shall be at least ten feet wide. When topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities along the rear lot lines of a subdivision, lot, or land development site, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side lot lines with satisfactory access.
(b)
Utilities in streets. All utilities to be installed in the streets shall be placed and compacted prior to paving.
