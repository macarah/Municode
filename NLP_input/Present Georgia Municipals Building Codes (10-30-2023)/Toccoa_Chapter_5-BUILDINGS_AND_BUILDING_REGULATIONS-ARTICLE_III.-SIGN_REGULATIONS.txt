Editor's note— An ordinance adopted on June 17, 2013 , has been treated by the editor as superseding former Art. III, §§ 5-180—5-189, in its entirety. Former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 98-009, § 1, 8-24-98; Ord. No. 2000-21, 10-23-00.

Secs. 5-178, 5-179. - Reserved.
Sec. 5-180. - Purpose and findings.
The Toccoa City Commission finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and as a detriment to property values and to the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this article, the city commission intends to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(3)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(4)
Maintain the historical image of the city; finding that the development in the historic district, Main Street district area and along Currahee Street from Hill Street to Nassau Street and along Tugalo Street from North Big A Road to Short Street and along Falls Road; the compactness of buildings and businesses in these districts; the geometry of public road intersections is unique from other areas of the city due to its history, architecture, cultural heritage and integrity; its substantial contribution to the economic vitality that these areas should be preserved and the appearance of the historic downtown and surrounding area, improved thereby assuring that signs are properly integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites in the historic downtown;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Promote economic development;
(7)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
(8)
Balance the commercial and public interest with the intent to maintain aesthetically pleasing thoroughfares in the city.
