Single family detached home in residential zone districts) that is allowed in the district where the lot is located.
For such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width building, the Zoning Board of Appeals is empowered to hear the request for a minimum variance.
Adjoining Lots: If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of this ordinance and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width, and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of contiguous lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this Ordinance.
