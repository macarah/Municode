CHAPTER 4. - ETHICS POLICY[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 016-13, adopted July 1, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 4, §§ 2-4001—2-4030, and enacted a new Ch. 4 as set out herein. The former Ch. 4 pertained to the same subject matter. Refer to Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

Sec. 2-4001. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
Our government is a representative democracy. Those who are elected, appointed, hired, volunteer, or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that government be conducted in an open manner, when appropriate, so that the official actions of public servants may be subject to public scrutiny and so that members of the public have access to information upon which decisions and policies affecting them are made; but public trust also requires that government be conducted in a manner which respects the rights of its constituents to privacy and confidentiality. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair.
(b)
It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. Therefore, dedicated public servants not only act with integrity, but also choose to avoid even lawful activity when the appearance of impropriety would lessen the public's confidence in the integrity of its servants and its system. As a result, sometimes public servants sacrifice opportunities which would be open to them if they were not public servants.
(c)
Most public servants strive to live by these standards most of the time, but because sometimes some do not, some formal policies are necessary. In adopting these formal policies, this community recognizes that:
(1)
Public servants are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do; and
(2)
Public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights; and
(3)
It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material and avoidable; and
(4)
Public servants are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments; and
(5)
In this community it is possible and reasonable to require public servants to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community.
(d)
Although this chapter is necessary to identify minimum standards below which a public servant's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty, it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards. Therefore, this chapter also requires that the community provide additional, positive means of encouraging ethical behavior among its public servants. It is also understood that no external activity can replace the internal commitment which motivates those who act ethically. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this chapter is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm.
(e)
A work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who:
(1)
Recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public; and
(2)
Recognize with pride that they hold their public position because the public trusts them; and
(3)
Recognize with sadness that the public's trust in government and in them is diminished when any public servant acts unethically; and
(4)
Recognize with hope that their public service is an opportunity to help restore public trust in their government; and
(5)
Are fair and impartial, but also courteous and enthusiastic in serving the public and each other in the performance of their duties; and
(6)
Are adequately educated in the principles of ethics; and
(7)
Are motivated to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards; and
(8)
Exemplify ethical conduct; and
(9)
Encourage ethical practices which protect, advance and promote the public interest; and
(10)
In speaking about the conduct of those in public service, or in responding to others who speak about it, express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior, and refrain from unjustly disparaging or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior; and
(11)
Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves, and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of those with whom they work; and
(12)
Exercise sound and independent judgment to act ethically in situations where others around them may be inclined to act unethically; and
(13)
When they observe serious unethical practices, promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities, and encourage others to do the same; and
(14)
Make and implement decisions and policies through proper channels of the governmental organization; and
(15)
Insure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and
(16)
When unethical behavior has been determined by the board, they will make the appropriate recommendation to the appropriate legal authority and the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 016-13, 7-1-13)

(e)
Duty to comply with the law.

In addition to being a violation of other laws, it is also a violation of this chapter for any public servant to:

Be convicted of habitual violations of other federal, state and local laws. Public servants have an ethical duty to abide by the general laws of the state and city, such as the laws governing driving under the influence, the uniform rules of the road, and offenses involving moral turpitude. Habitual violations of state and city laws may indicate disrespect for the law and may contribute to the erosion of public trust.
a.
If any person believes that a public servant has been convicted of habitual violations of state, federal, or local laws, and that those convictions contribute to the erosion of public trust, that person may file a written complaint with the city clerk, setting forth the facts upon which the complaint is based.

In the event the panel finds that the alleged offender is guilty of habitual violations of law and that the violations contribute to the erosion of public trust, the panel shall have no power other than to inform the offender and city council of the panel's findings, which may subject the offender to further disciplinary action. Having received such notice, the offender shall violate this chapter if the offender violates the order of the board.
b.
In addition, the governing body, or city manager, where applicable, acting with the authorization of the governing body, may adopt a policy more precisely describing this general duty of all public servants to comply with specified laws in order to help gain and retain respect for city government.

The procedures adopted in connection with the policy must safeguard the Constitutional rights of the public servants who are subject to the policy, including the rights of notice and a hearing. If the city adopts a general policy, public servants have a duty to adhere to that policy. If they fail to do so, and thereafter, in accordance with the procedures established by the policy, are determined to have violated the policy, the violation of the policy by the public servants shall also constitute a violation of this provision of this chapter.
