ARTICLE V. - RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING

Sec. 19-80. - Statement of findings.
The mayor and council finds that older residential areas of the city neighboring certain business, commercial, and educational uses have a shortage of parking as a result of minimal lot widths and high concentrations of visitors during certain hours. The result of such problems is that residents of the city have insufficient parking to accommodate their own vehicles. Additionally, in certain areas, as a result of parking congestion, there is insufficient space for movement of emergency vehicles to adequately respond in the event of emergency. The mayor and council find that such situations necessitate an innovative solution which will relieve parking congestion while supporting city neighborhoods.

(2)
All single family and two-family uses:
a.
Access shall be limited to one (1) driveway for each lot; the city engineer may approve one (1) additional driveway upon a finding that such driveway will not cause a traffic hazard, that the design of such driveway complies with sound engineering practice and that surrounding properties will not be adversely impacted. Individual driveways shall not exceed ten (10) feet in width, measured at the right-of-way.
b.
No driveway shall be established within ten (10) feet of the points of tangency of the curve connecting such driveway to a public street and any property line of adjacent private property. Measurements shall be made along the edge of pavement from the nearest point of tangency.
c.
