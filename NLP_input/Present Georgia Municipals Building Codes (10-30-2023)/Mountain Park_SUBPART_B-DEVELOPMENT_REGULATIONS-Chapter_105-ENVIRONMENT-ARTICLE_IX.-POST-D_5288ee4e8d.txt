ARTICLE IX. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 105-390. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the City of Mountain Park is required to comply with several State and Federal laws, regulations, and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-construction stormwater runoff. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and,
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
In implementing this article, the City of Mountain Park shall use and require compliance with all relevant design standards, calculations, formulas, methods, and other guidance from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) as well as all related appendices. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other article, ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, including, but not limited to, any applicable stream buffers under state and local laws, and the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision in the City of Mountain Park's MS4 permit and this article, the provision from the MS4 permit shall control. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and the GSMM, the provision from this article shall control. In the event of any other conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, the provision that is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. If any provision of this article is invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of this article.

Sec. 105-403. - Modifications for off-site facilities.
(a)
The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices, and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the city which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility.
(b)
To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city council that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas:
(1)

(5)
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations.
(Ord. No. 287-06, 1-23-2006; Ord. No. O340-22 , § I,(Exh. A), 7-25-2022)
Sec. 105-404. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
Subject to the applicability criteria in Section 105-391(a), and exemptions in Section 105-391(b), the following stormwater management standards apply. Additional details for each standard can be found in GSMM Section 2.2.2.2. The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(1)
Design of stormwater management system. The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the administrator. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(2)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided using the following:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 6, 2020, the applicant may choose either (A) runoff reduction or (B) water quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 6, 2020, the applicant shall choose (A) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (B) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
(A)
Runoff reduction—The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
(B)
Water quality—The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot, the City of Mountain Park may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(3)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(4)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the 1-year, 24-hour storm is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the 2-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
(5)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(6)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from (local permitting authority) before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities, warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(7)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required by this article. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(8)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
b.
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and,
c.
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(9)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(10)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall reserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(11)
Natural resources inventory. Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of 2-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., areas with slopes greater than 15 percent),
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns,
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas),
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors,
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(12)
Downstream Analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises 10% of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from the development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(13)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the City of Mountain Park, including all drainage facilities, best management practice, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in section 105-406.
(Ord. No. 287-06, 1-23-2006; Ord. No. O340-22 , § I,(Exh. A), 7-25-2022)
Sec. 105-405. - Construction inspections.
(a)
Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the City of Mountain Park's code enforcement officer or conducted and certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the City of Mountain Park. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance. All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information:
(1)
The date and location of the inspection;
(2)
Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan;
(3)

(4)
Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan.
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions.
(b)
Final inspection and as built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan and that the stormwater management system is functioning properly. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. The applicant is also responsible for certifying that the landscaping is established and installed in conformance with the BMP landscaping plan, and for delivering to the City of Mountain Park a signed inspection and maintenance agreement that has been recorded by the owner in the property record for all parcel(s) that make up the site. The required certification that the stormwater management system is functioning properly shall include a certification of volume, or other performance test applicable to the type of stormwater management system component, to ensure each component is functioning as designed and built according to the design specifications in the stormwater management plan. This certification and the required performance tests shall be performed by a qualified person and submitted to the City of Mountain Park with the request for final inspection. The City of Mountain Park shall perform a final inspection with the applicant to confirm applicant has fulfilled these responsibilities. A final inspection by the code enforcement officer or authorized personnel is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.
(Ord. No. 287-06, 1-23-2006; Ord. No. O340-22 , § I,(Exh. A), 7-25-2022)
Sec. 105-406. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices.
(a)
Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this article. An owner shall execute an inspection and maintenance agreement with the City of Mountain Park obligating the owner to inspect, clean, maintain, and repair the stormwater management system; including vegetation in the final BMP landscaping plan. The form of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall be the form provided by the City of Mountain Park. After the inspection and maintenance agreement has been signed by the owner and the City of Mountain Park, the owner shall promptly record such agreement at the owner's cost in the property record for all parcel(s) that make up the site. A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person specified in the inspection and maintenance agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city may correct the violation as provided in this article.
Inspection programs by the city may be established on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.
(b)
The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for the code enforcement officer or authorized personnel of the City of Mountain Park to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when there is a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. If the site was developed before the requirement to have an inspection and maintenance agreement or an inspection and maintenance agreement was for any reason not entered into, recorded or has otherwise been invalidated or deemed insufficient, then the City of Mountain Park shall have the right to enter and make inspections pursuant to section 101-10.
The inspection agreement shall identify by name or official title the person(s) serving as the point of contact for carrying out the owner's obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The owner shall update the point of contact from time to time as needed and upon request by the City of Mountain Park. Upon any sale or transfer of the site, the new owner shall notify the City of Mountain Park in writing within 30 days of the name or official title of the new person(s) serving as the point of contact for the new owner. Any failure of an owner to keep the point of contact up to date shall, following 30 days' notice, constitute failure to maintain the stormwater management system. The inspection and maintenance agreement shall run with the land and bind all future successors-in-title of the site. If there is a future sale or transfer of only a portion of the site, then: the parties to such sale or transfer may enter into and record an assignment agreement designating the owner responsible for each portion of the site and associated obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The parties shall record and provide written notice and a copy of such assignment agreement to the City of Mountain Park. In the absence of a recorded assignment agreement, all owners of the site shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement regardless of what portion of the site they own.
(c)
Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall provide records of all maintenance and repairs to the city.
(d)
If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city, after 30 days' written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work which shall be a lien on the property, and may be placed on the ad valorum tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes.
