Sec. 22-184. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(3)
It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Pine Lake, Georgia." The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological and economical development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Code 1986, § 6-1-17(1))
Sec. 22-185. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map of the city is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated as a part of this article as if fully set out herein. It is a general reference document and applies to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk.
(b)
Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(c)
Relationship to zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the city zoning map, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this article by reference. When the two conflict, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
(Code 1986, § 6-1-17(2))
Sec. 22-186. - Local development permits.
(a)
Requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 100 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the Corps determine the wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(b)
Permit requirements within the wetland district setback. Prior to issuance of any development permit for activity within 100 feet of a wetland, the applicant must include, with the site plans for the proposed action, documentation that the following post-development conditions will prevail at the site:
(1)
The rate of stormwater runoff, volume of stormwater runoff and peak runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development levels.
(2)
The amount of the following pollutants carried within runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development conditions:
a.
Phosphorus;
b.
Nitrogen;
c.
Zinc;
d.
Lead.
In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TSS) shall not exceed pre-development levels.
(3)
In addition to other fees assessed, the applicant may be held liable for costs incurred by the city during evaluation of the performance standards evaluation.
(c)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided that they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.). (Note: Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required performance standards and 15 specific road construction best management practices (BMPs) that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.)
(4)
The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture, and an undisturbed vegetated setback/buffer of 50 feet shall be maintained between the agricultural practice and the wetland.
(5)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(6)
Temporary emergency permits can be issued by the city for the following reasons:
a.
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
b.
Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
c.
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (c)(4) of this section
d.
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(d)
Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information:
