In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new subdivisions and other planned developments, the planning board is hereby authorized to recommend that the governing authority modify the standards and requirements, but not the intent of these regulations and zoning standards, in the case of a plan that exhibits unique quality growth features within a planned unit, which, in the judgment of the planning board:
(1)
Provides significant public spaces for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated;
(2)
Which exhibits unique "quality" features in keeping with state department of community affairs principles;
(3)
Which addresses each of the county's quality development guidelines; and
(4)
Which provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and achievement of the comprehensive development plan.
(b)
Any development considered for "quality development" status shall be analyzed using these principles and the guidelines listed below. The following is a list of the county's performance guidelines against which all proposed quality developments will be analyzed:
(1)
Does the proposed development provide an appropriate and significant amount of uplands dedicated to open space, recreational, and other public uses that are available for the use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development and citizens of the county?
(2)
Will the development as designed minimize impacts to, and preserve, wetlands and floodplains?
(3)
Has the proposal minimized the impervious surfaces in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and does it include the use of measures such as low impact design or other strategies to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of all runoff?
(4)
Are the connectivity of open spaces and wetlands maximized in such a way as to create and preserve habitat areas for wildlife?
(5)
Does the design maximize the preservation and protection of large hardwood trees and woodlands in wetlands and uplands?
(6)
Does the proposal minimize or include mitigation for impacts on the county's, and the neighboring governments', infrastructure systems?
(c)
The planning board and governing authority staff shall review the proposed development in accordance with these guidelines and the principles, and may consider modification of standards and requirements should the proposed development exceed the subdivision regulations and adequately address each of these principles and guidelines. The developer or subdivider shall request that the governing authority staff consider the development for designation as a "quality development" and provide the information required by the planning board and governing authority staff in order to evaluate the request for the designation and the modification of any standards or requirements.

Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of this Land Development Code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.
(b)
Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(c)
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
(1)
Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
b.
The 100-year floodplain;
c.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; and
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.

(b)
Standards to determine open space.
(1)
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40 percent of the gross tract area.
(2)
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required to be included within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this section:
a.
The 100-year floodplain.
b.
Riparian zones of at least 75 feet width along all perennial and intermittent streams.
c.
Slopes above 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area.

b.
Existing healthy, native forests of at least one acre contiguous area.
c.
Individual existing healthy trees greater than eight inches caliper, as measured from their outermost drip line.
d.
Other significant natural features and scenic view sheds such as ridge lines, peaks and rock outcroppings, particularly those that can be seen from public roads.
e.
Prime agricultural lands of at least five acres contiguous area.
f.
Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
(4)
Above ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
(5)
At least 25 percent of the open space shall consist of land that is suitable for building.
(6)
At least 75 percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and nonprotected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space.
(7)
The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.
(c)
Permitted uses of open space. Uses of open space may include the following:
(1)
Conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources;
(2)
Meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, game preserves, or similar conservation-oriented areas;
(3)
Walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of porous paving materials;
(4)
Passive recreation areas, such as open fields;
(5)
Active recreation areas, provided that they are limited to no more than ten percent of the total open space and are not located within primary conservation areas. Active recreation areas may include impervious surfaces. Active recreation areas in excess of this limit must be located outside of the protected open space;
(6)
Agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to minimize environmental impacts, and such activities are not conducted within primary conservation areas;
(7)
Landscaped stormwater management facilities, community wastewater disposal systems and individual wastewater disposal systems located on soils particularly suited to such uses. Such facilities shall be located outside of primary conservation areas;
(8)
Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines;

Other activities as determined by the applicant and recorded on the legal instrument providing for permanent protection.
(e)
Ownership and management of open space.
(1)
Ownership of open space. The designated open space may be owned and managed by one or any combination of the following:
a.
A homeowners' association representing the residents of the subdivision. Membership in the association shall be mandatory and automatic for all homeowners of the subdivision and their successors. The homeowners' association shall have lien authority to ensure the collection of dues from all members. The responsibility for maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the homeowners' association.
b.
A nonprofit conservation organization deemed acceptable by the governing authority. The conveyance to the nonprofit conservation organization must contain appropriate provisions for reversion in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to uphold the terms of the conveyance.
c.
Public dedication of open space. The governing authority may accept the dedication of a conservation easement to the common open space, provided the common open space is accessible to the residents of the city or county and provided the county or city agrees to and has access to maintain the common open space.
d.
Individual ownership. An individual may hold fee title to the land while a nonprofit or other qualified organization holds a conservation easement governing uses of the open space.
(2)
Management plan. An applicant shall submit a plan for management of open space and common facilities ("plan") that:
a.
Allocates responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements;
b.
Estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided;
c.
Provides that any changes to the plan be approved by the governing authority; and
d.
Provides for enforcement of the plan.
(3)
In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the governing authority may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the homeowners' association, or to the individual property owners that make up the homeowners' association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties.
(f)
Legal instrument for permanent protection.
(1)
The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following:
a.
A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
1.
A land trust or similar conservation-oriented nonprofit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or
2.
A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this division. If the entity accepting the easement is not the governing authority, then a third right of enforcement favoring the governing authority shall be included in the easement.
b.
A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity.
c.
An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the governing authority.
(2)
The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this section, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space.
(g)
Tax assessment of open space. Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the open space, the county tax assessor may, upon request of the property owner, reassess the open space at a lower value to reflect its more limited use. If the open space is used purely for passive recreational purposes and the terms of the instrument for permanent protection effectively prohibit any type of significant economic activity, then the assessment may be at a value of zero.
