The department of public works shall periodically inspect to determine whether street numbers are being displayed in compliance with this article. If a lot is found whereon the correct street number is not being displayed in the correct manner, the department of public works may take the following action:
(1)
Notice of noncompliance. The superintendent of the department of public works or any employee of the department or any police officer acting upon the authority of the superintendent shall issue a written notice, which shall contain the date of the notice, the correct street address and a description of the deficiency or other noncompliance observed. One copy of such notice shall be either delivered to the occupant at the lot or attached to the building, one copy will be mailed to the owner of record as per the records of the county taxing authority, one copy will be filed with the city clerk and one copy will be kept as part of the records of the department of public works. The notice shall contain an order that the correct street number be properly displayed within ten days from the date of the notice.
(2)
Penalty. Failure to correctly display the street number within ten days after the date of the notice shall constitute a violation of this article and shall, upon conviction, subject both the owner and occupant to punishment as provided in section 1-11.
(3)
Assessment. If neither the owner nor the occupant comply with the requirement that the street number be properly displayed within ten days following the issuance of a notice as described in subsection (1) of this section, the superintendent of the department of public works may cause the street number to be properly displayed at the expense of the city, and the total cost of such action, including but not limited to materials, labor and reasonable costs of litigation, including attorney's fees, shall be a lien upon the real estate upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the cost by the city clerk in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes. Thereafter the lien may be collected by adding same to the cost of any city license fee, city utility bill or other city assessment owed by either the owner or the occupant within a period of seven years after the date of filing of the lien. No deposit for city utilities may be refunded on property upon which such a lien exists, until the lien is paid in full. No city utility services may commence for property upon which such a lien exists, until the lien is paid in full. Also, the lien may be collected by direct litigation against either the owner or the occupant, filed in the name of the city, and the city would be entitled to recover not only the amount of the lien, but any cost of court or other reasonable litigation expense, including attorney's fees, necessary for the enforcement of the lien.
