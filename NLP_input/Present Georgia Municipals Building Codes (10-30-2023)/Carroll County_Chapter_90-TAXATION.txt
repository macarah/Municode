Census geographic block groups with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the standards of paragraph (2) of this subsection but shall be treated as having a zero poverty rate for the purpose of applying paragraph (3) of this subsection; and
(5)
All parcels of a nominated area must abut and may not contain a noncontiguous parcel, unless nonabutting parcel qualifies separately under the criteria set forth under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

Unemployment shall be evidenced by the use of data published by the office of labor information systems of the state department of labor indicating that the average rate of unemployment for the nominated area for the preceding calendar year is at least ten percent higher than the state average rate of unemployment or by evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by significant job dislocation within the nominated area such as the closing of a manufacturing plant or federal facility.

Underdevelopment shall be evidenced by data indicating development activities, or lack thereof, through land disturbance permits, business license fees, building permits, development fees, or other similar data indicating that the level of development in the nominated area is at least 20 percent lower than other development activity within the county and the City of Carrollton.
(f)
The county board of commissioners and Carrollton city council find that based on evidence, the area contained in the enterprise zone delineated in exhibit A satisfies at least three of the four criteria set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6 and constitutes the enterprise zone(s) of the county and City of Carrollton, to be known as "West Carrollton Enterprise District".

EXHIBIT B
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONDITIONS
Additional Considerations
The Enterprise Zone Employment Act of 1997 Section 36-88-4(b) empowers the local governing body to make a case-by-case determination of the eligibility of each business for enterprise zone tax abatements and other incentives. Among the considerations may be the following:
A.
The value of the business to the economic health and well-being of Carroll County and the City of Carrollton.
B.
Capital investment or reinvestment by the business equal to or greater than the amount of ad valorem tax abated over the first five years of the tax incentive.
C.
Consideration for meeting some or all of the following criteria:
a.
Locating in a vacant building
b.
Demolishing a pre-existing or abandoned structure
c.
Assembling four or more tract of land for one project
d.
Creating jobs above the state threshold
e.
Incorporating aesthetic enhancements (i.e.: landscaping, type of facade materials used, exclusion of billboards)
Additional Conditions for Qualification: Aesthetic Enhancements
In order to enhance the aesthetic character of the Enterprise Zone area, all projects receiving tax exemptions must incorporate, and maintain for the duration of the tax exemption period, one of the following options (these options are minimum guidelines and projects may incorporate more extensive measures):
Option A - Landscaping
A fifteen-foot wide landscaped strip containing a minimum of three canopy trees or six small trees per 100 linear feet and 25 shrubs and/or ornamental grasses per 100 linear feet must be installed adjacent to all property lines adjacent to the public right-of-way. Canopy tree species used shall have an average nature crown spread of at least 25 feet when grown in Carroll County, GA. Trees must be at least four feet in height and have a caliper of at least 1½ inches immediately after planting. In order to maximize the survival chances of the tree, no paving shall be allowed within 12½ feet of the tree's trunk. Shrubs and ornamental grasses shall be a minimum of 12 inches in height when measured immediately after planting. Trees of a species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than twelve feet to such public works. A list of suggested tree, shrub, and ornamental grass species will be provided.
Ground cover must also be provided throughout the landscaped strip to minimize potential soil erosion. If grass is used, it shall be of a species normally grown as permanent lawns in the vicinity of Carroll County, GA. Mulch must be confined to areas underneath plants and is not a substitute for ground cover plants. Ground covers shall be planted in a manner to present a finished appearance within six months after planting. Grass area may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion.
Installation
Plantings must be installed to current nursery industry standards. Plant materials must be properly supported to ensure survival. Support devises such as guy wires or stakes must not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement and must be removed as soon as the plant can support itself.
Areas for required landscaping shall not be used as a waste dump or fill during the construction process. All waste materials shall be removed from areas to be landscaped prior to the application of topsoil. Soils devoid of organic materials shall not be utilized as topsoil for required landscape areas. Where such areas have been excavated to soil levels containing no organic material, the landscape plan shall provide for the placement of topsoil of a depth sufficient to ensure plant survival.
All plantings that die or are destroyed must be replaced in kind within three months.
Irrigation
To ensure that plants will survive the critical establishment period when they are most vulnerable due to lack of watering, all required landscaped areas must proved either a permanent built-in irrigation system with an automatic controller; or an irrigation system designed as part of the Landscape Plan, which provides sufficient water to ensure that plants will become established. The system does not have to be permanent if the plants chosen can survive adequately on their own once established.
Option B - Facade Materials/Landscaping
If the building facade(s) visible from the public right-of-way is (are) constructed exclusively of brick, masonry, glass, or wood (or a combination of these materials), the landscaping requirement shall be a four-foot wide strip containing evergreen shrubs and/or ornamental grasses planted no further than three feet apart adjacent to the main entrance of the building and continuing for at least 20 feet on both sides of the main entrance door, or to the edge of the facade, whichever is less. Shrubs and ornamental grasses shall be a minimum of 12 inches in height when measured immediately after planting.
The installation and irrigation requirements are the same as Option A.
Additional Aesthetic Enhancement Requirement
Projects receiving tax exemptions must exclude billboards from their property for the duration of the tax exemption period.
