ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Sec. 12-19. - Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the state has, in article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners does ordain the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 4-14-1998, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 12-20. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. of 4-14-1998, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 12-21. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. of 4-14-1998, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 12-22. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as (without limitation) water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in a floodplain;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the floodplain management committee shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The office of building inspection shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the floodplain management committee may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(Ord. of 4-14-1998, art. 5)
Sec. 12-122. - Effects of nonparticipation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(a)
Flood insurance will no longer be available. No resident will be able to purchase a flood insurance policy.
(b)
No federal grants or loans for buildings may be made in identified flood hazard areas. This includes all federal agencies such as LIUD, EPA, SBA, HUR, etc.
(c)
No federal disaster assistance may be provided in identified flood hazard areas. This includes FHA, VA, Farmers Home Administration, etc.
(d)
Recent legislative changes to Flood Disaster Protection Act: Restriction on conventional loans in nonparticipating communities replaced by requirement that lenders:
(1)
Must notify buyer or lessee that property is in a flood hazard area; and
(2)
Must notify buyer or lessee that property is in a flood hazard area and is not eligible for federal disaster relief in a declared disaster.
(e)
The flood insurance rate map and appropriate actuarial rates go into effect regardless of whether or not a community participates in the program. Lacking a local ordinance, unsafe construction today may result in prohibitively expensive insurance rates tomorrow.
(f)
The local governing body may be susceptible to liability by not participating, because their action:
(1)
Denies the ability of its citizens to purchase flood insurance; and
(2)
Does not take positive steps to reduce the exposure of life and property in the face of authoritative scientific and technical data.

If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or any other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority.
(b)
Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agents, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article or in a dangerous or unsafe manner shall be immediately stopped. Such notices shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required.
(c)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served on that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve the compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 12-149(b)(5)b. The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)
Monetary penalties. Any person violating any provisions of this article, permitting conditions, or a stop-work order shall be liable for a monetary penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day, by a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail or both fine and jail or work alternative. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation.

Sec. 12-152. - Administrative appeal, judicial review.
(a)
Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the sole commissioner within 15 days after receipt by the issuing authority of written notice of appeal.
(b)
Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de nova to the superior court of the county.
(Ord. of 9-12-1995(eff.), § VIII)
Sec. 12-153. - Liability.
(a)
Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property.
(b)
The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

(Ord. of 3-15-2021, §§ 3—5)
Sec. 12-178. - Bond or letter of credit required.
(a)
The notice required by this article shall not be or remain effective unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the county commissioners' office a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in the state, protecting the county against any damage caused by such person or firm in the amount of $5,000.00; provided, however, that at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of $5,000.00 may be provided in lieu of a surety bond. Such bonds or letters of credit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. No more than one bond or letter of credit shall be required from each person or firm harvesting timber, regardless of the number of tracts harvested in the county for so long as the bond or letter of credit remains in effect. The bond or letter of credit required herein shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it was delivered.
(b)
The bond or letter of credit required by subsection (a) of this section shall protect the county against any damage requiring re-ditching or repair of existing ditch structures or the removal of any harvesting residue, including tree tops, debris, logs, pulpwood and other materials, placed in or around the county's rights-of-way caused by such person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights-of-way. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall also be available to reimburse the county for any costs incurred to maintain or repair county roads damaged by the ingress or egress of motor vehicles engaged in the harvest operations located within 500 feet of any point of ingress or egress of the timber harvesting operation. The right of the county to call such bond or letter of credit in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall be in addition to any other remedies available to the county at law or in equity for damage to county roads or rights-of-way.
(c)
When damage results from a person's or firm's harvesting activities, the county commissioners' office shall make and provide a written claim to the person or firm causing the damage within 30 business days after the commissioners' office becomes aware of the damage. Such claim may be given in person, by telefacsimile, email or mail. The claim shall describe the damage in detail and, in compliance with subsection (d)(1) of this section, give the person or firm the opportunity to repair such damage within 30 days of the notification; provided, however, the county shall be authorized to repair the damage immediately if the board of commissioners or its designee determines the conditions present a threat to public safety, health or welfare and, upon making such repairs, shall present to the person or firm and the issuer of the applicable bond or letter of credit an itemized list of expenses incurred as a claim against the responsible party and the issuer of its bond or letter of credit. Upon the issuance of a claim as provided in this subsection the county board of commissioners or its designee shall notify the issuer of the bond or letter of credit that a claim has been made and will be resolved or adjudicated according to the terms of this article.
(d)
Within 30 days of receipt of the written claim described in subsection (c) of this section, the person or firm against whom the claim is submitted may:
(1)
Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the county board of commissioners or its designee. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of the board of commissioners or its designee, the board of commissioners or its designee shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.
(2)
In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30-day extension to repair the damage from the county board of commissioners, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered. Approval of any extension shall be at the discretion of the county board of commissioners or its designee.
(3)
Appeal the claim to the magistrate court of the county. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The magistrate court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the 30-day period, or any extension thereof, required by subsection (c) of this section. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the county, the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the county board of commissioners shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsection (d)(1), (2) or (3) of this section within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.
(e)
If the person or firm tendering a bond or letter of credit pursuant to the requirements of this article continues its timber harvesting operation beyond the calendar year in which the bond or letter of credit was issued, the person or firm continuing the timber harvesting operation shall tender a new bond or letter of credit within five business days after the first day of the new calendar year.
(f)
In the event a bond or letter of credit tendered pursuant to the requirements of this article is revoked by the surety or bank, then a valid replacement bond or letter of credit must be delivered to the county board of commissioners within five business days after the date of revocation in order for timber harvesting operations to continue. In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The maximum amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not exceed $10,000.00.
