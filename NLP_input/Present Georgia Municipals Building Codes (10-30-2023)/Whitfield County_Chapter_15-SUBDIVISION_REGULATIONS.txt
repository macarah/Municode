a.
For any lot or parcel located within the General Agriculture (GA) zoning district, there shall be excepted from the three acre minimum lot requirement any subdivision of a lot or parcel for purposes of transfer, either by sale or by gift, to a family member of the original owner thereof:

ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 15-31. - Purposes.
The purposes of appropriate subdivision and site design is to promote the health, welfare, and safety of the public; to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing development; to minimize adverse impacts; and to ensure that projects will be designed to result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-1; Res. of 5-13-02)
Sec. 15-32. - General design principles.
(1)
Land suitability. Land which is unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, wetlands, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and/or the general public and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are designed by the developer/subdivider to solve the problems created by the unstable land conditions. Said design methods shall include but not be limited to Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Manuals and Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges and the Utility Accommodations Policy and Standards, current editions, and supplements thereto; American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manuals for Arterial Streets, Rural, Urban, and Interstate Highways, current editions; American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards, current editions, Georgia State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Environmental Protection Division (EPD), Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Rules and Regulations for Water Quality Control, latest editions; American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards, latest editions; and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards, latest editions. Any such design(s) shall be subject to review and approval by the Whitfield County Engineer. The county engineer shall provide a written statement justifying the denial of the final plat based on land suitability.
(2)
Annexation. Subdivisions planned for future annexation by any city shall be developed to then-current city standards, if any such standard shall exceed that of Whitfield County, and shall be subject to the review and comment of such city.
(Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-2; Res. of 5-13-02)
Sec. 15-33. - General subdivision design standards.
(1)
Monuments. The developer/subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as required herein and as approved by a Georgia Registered Land Surveyor. Monuments shall be located and set as follows:
(a)
Monuments shall be located upon road right-of-way lines, at road intersections and at the beginning and ending points of curves.
(b)
All lot corners shall be marked by iron rods, pipe, or pins at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter.
(c)
Lot lines which extend to any state waters shall be monumented in the field by iron pins at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 18 inches long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the state waters and lot line, with a meander line established not less than 20 feet back from the bank of the state waters.
(d)
All monuments and pins shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered surveyor prior to the submittal of any plat.
(2)
Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision shall be approved by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department and shall neither duplicate nor closely approximate the name of any existing subdivision. Whitfield County may regularly maintain a register of such names, accessible to the public, updated not less than monthly.
(3)
Residential development design.
(a)
The Whitfield County Engineer and/or the planning commission may require additional lot area and/or setbacks provided that lots conform to the minimum requirements of this chapter and the Whitfield County Zoning Ordinance.
(b)
Each lot or parcel shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as well as for those requiring access to the property for its intended use.
(c)
The design of lots in residential developments shall take into consideration topography, privacy, orientation, drainage, and aesthetics.
(4)
Manufacturing and commercial development design. Manufacturing and commercial development shall be designed according to similar principles governing the design of residential developments. Buildings shall be located according to topography, with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable. Factors such as drainage, noise, odor, surrounding land uses and sufficient access shall be considered.
(5)
Circulation system design. Road systems shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of traffic; to meet the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive roadscape.
(6)
Access by private roads. Private roads may [be] approved in subdivision developments where controlled access or privacy is desired by the developer/subdivider provided such roads meet the following conditions:
(a)
The preliminary and final plats of a development proposing private roads shall show a statement indicating: "The road system is private and will not be maintained or improved by Whitfield County."
(b)
The plat review process shall also include evidence of the legal formation of a property owners association to be charged with the minimum responsibility for maintenance of the private road. Such legal documentation shall be recorded and referenced as an attachment to the final plat.
(Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-3; Res. of 5-13-02; Res. of 1-9-07, § 2; Ord. of 3-19-07)
Sec. 15-34. - Lot design standards.
All lots hereafter established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards:
(1)
Lot lines. Insofar as practicable, side lot lines shall be perpendicular to or radial to roadways.
(2)
Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by preexisting city or county boundary lines.
(3)
Lot access. Each lot or parcel created shall have direct abutting access to an approved public or private road. Each lot must front for at least 50 feet upon an approved road. Construction and/or maintenance of driveways connecting to the public road right-of-way or to the private road shall be the sole responsibility of the lot or parcel owner.
(4)
Building setback lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 25 feet from the front property line for lots abutting local roads. With the exception of panhandle or flag lots, the minimum lot width of any lot shall be achieved at a distance into the lot that is not greater than the total frontage distance of the lot.
(5)
Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by this chapter and any existing ordinance, as is appropriate.
(6)
Panhandle or flag lots. Flag lot designs are generally discouraged and shall only be approved by the planning commission, and such approval is only justified when extreme topographic circumstances, environmental factors, or socio/economic factors make standard design impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the panhandle access of the lot shall not be less than 50 feet wide for its length, and not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other. The following additional criteria apply:
a.
The length of the panhandle access ("the pole") shall generally be no longer than the average depth of the lots adjacent to the panhandle access that are fronting the street; and
b.
In computing the minimum lot size, the geometric area encompassed in the panhandle access shall be excluded.
(7)
Double and/or reverse frontage lots. Double and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planted screen reservation of at least five feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such traffic arterials or other disadvantageous use.
(8)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of structures so as to conform to the minimum setback requirement upon both roads. Corner lot lines at road intersections shall have a minimum radii of 20 feet.
(9)
Lot remnants. Lot remnants, except those in excess of three acres created in connection with an exempt subdivision, shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots or shall be set aside as green space with permanent conservation easements, rather than to remain as unusable parcels.
(10)
Easements. Easements shall be provided in subdivisions for the following purposes:
a.
Utility easements. When necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than road rights-of-way, easements shall be shown upon the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall be not less than 15 feet in width and, where possible, shall be centered upon rear or side lot lines.
b.
Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of said watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction.
c.
Family easement access exemption. There shall be exempted from the access requirement set forth hereinabove at section 15-11 any subdivision of a lot or parcel into not more than five total parcels (which shall include any remaining portion of the original parcel and any other preexisting lots or parcels accessed by such casement) for purposes of transfer, either by sale or by gift, to a family member of the original owner thereof.
1.
The original parcel may be subdivided at one time or over a period of time; however, each exemption for each proposed divided parcel shall be considered separately.
2.
Such exemption shall be requested in writing upon forms provided by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, which shall thereafter request the Whitfield County Fire Chief or his designee to inspect the proposed divided parcel, including the proposed access, and to report back in writing whether such proposed access is or is not adequate for fire protection and other emergency services.
3.
The transfer of any portion of the original parcel or of any divided parcel other than by the laws of testate or intestate succession shall automatically result in the prohibition of any further access exemption for any portion of the original parcel.
4.
The original owner shall provide birth certificates and/or other documentation to the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, as reasonably requested, to establish a sufficient family connection for purposes of the exemption.
5.
Any misstatement of a material fact or violation of any of the provisions of this subsection by the original owner or a family member shall constitute sufficient grounds for denial by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, either for the pending request or for any future requests concerning the original or previously divided parcels.
6.
A divided parcel as well as any remaining portion of the original parcel must at all times meet applicable minimum lot size standards then in effect pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
7.
A divided parcel created pursuant to the terms of this exemption shall include, as an appurtenance thereto, a specifically described nonexclusive easement, 50 feet in width, for purposes of ingress, egress, and above and below ground utility services, allowing access from such divided parcel to a public right-of-way.
8.
The proposed subdivision plat shall contain a statement to read as follows:
FAMILY EXEMPTION PROPERTY
The property shown hereon has been exempted from certain provisions of the Whitfield County Subdivision Ordinance pursuant to subsection 3-10c, of said ordinance. Said property is not located on a public road and, due to such fact, certain county services may not be provided to said property.
9.
No divided parcel or portion thereof shall be eligible for a family easement exemption allowed herein.
10.
Such family easement exemption shall be prohibited in the R-4, R-5, R-6, C-1, C-2, C-2C, M-1, and M-2 zoning districts (as set forth in the Whitfield County Zoning Ordinance).
(11)
Lot depth. Residential lot depth shall not be less than 120 feet or more than four times the lot width at the building line, unless approved by the planning commission after considering topographic circumstances or environmental factors.

Sec. 15-35. - Road design standards.
All roads, whether public or private, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a major subdivision shall comply with the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance.
(1)
Access to arterials and collectors. Where a subdivision borders upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector route, as defined upon the Georgia Department of Transportation Functional Classification Map, it may be required that access to such road be limited by:
a.
The subdivision of lots so as to back on the arterial or collector road and front on a parallel local road;
b.
A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped roads, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel road, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial or collector road; or
c.
A frontage road.
(2)
Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed road in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such road shall generally not be permitted. However, in extraordinary circumstances, the Whitfield County Engineer may allow creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or roads. A notation to this effect shall be entered upon the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached thereto.
(3)
Arrangement of continuing and dead-end roads. Temporary or permanent dead-end roads shall be designed as follows:
a.
Arrangement of continuing roads. The arrangement of roads shall provide for the continuation of arterial and/or collector roads between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movements of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities, and when such continuation is in accordance with the arterial and/or collector road or road plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the road must be a dead-end road temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de-sac, temporary "T", or "Y"-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end roads as required in the following turnabout standards, with a notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal road right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the road is continued.
b.
Dead-end roads. Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Whitfield County Engineer for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Whitfield County Engineer may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of a dead-end road in accordance with the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance.
(4)
Intersections. Intersections of new roads in a subdivision shall comply with the following standards:
a.
Roads shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two roads at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be permitted.

(6)
Road names. Roads which are extensions of or in alignment with existing named roads shall bear that name. The names of new roads shall be subject to the approval of the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names irrespective of the use of the suffix road, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place, or court, etc. Whitfield County may regularly maintain a register of such names, accessible to the public, updated not less than monthly.
(7)
Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways, where located so as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
a.
In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normally required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated upon the plat: "This strip is reserved for buffers; the placement of structures hereon is prohibited."
b.
In manufacturing or commercial areas, the nearest road extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad or limited access highway shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth of manufacturing or commercial sites.
c.
Roads parallel to a railroad or limited access highway, when intersecting a road which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practical, be at a distance of at least feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(8)
Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the developer/subdivider, as determined by the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners, shall be constructed at the full expense of the developer/subdivider without reimbursement from Whitfield County. The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the developer/subdivider, as determined by the board of commissioners, may be fixed by special agreement between Whitfield County and the developer/subdivider. The cost shall be prorated to the developer/subdivider as to the percentage of his development so served. The engineering design of all bridges shall be reviewed and approved by the Whitfield County Engineer.
(9)
Special purpose roads.
a.
Half roads. Half roads are prohibited. Whenever a road is planned adjacent to the proposed lot or parcel boundary, the entire road right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision.
b.
Split-level roads. Roads, which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall provide a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet per traffic way and such additional right-of-way as necessary to meet the requirements of subsection 15-36(5), and a minimum paved traffic surface of 15 feet. The slope between the two traffic ways shall be not less than two to one.
(10)
Road name signs. The developer shall be fully responsible for payment to Whitfield County for the installation of all road name signs, traffic control signs and any other signs as specified in the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance.

(2)
The drainage system for a subdivision, residential, commercial, or manufacturing, shall be designed in accordance with sound engineering principles and procedures such that all marketable lots or parcels upon the plat are positively drained.
(3)
The drainage system shall be designed to accommodate drainage from adjacent lots or parcels which naturally drain to or through the lands being subdivided. The drainage system shall be designed such that it does not affect the natural drainage onto adjacent parcels unless an agreement is obtained by the developer/subdivider from the owner of such adjacent parcels. A copy of any such agreement shall be submitted to the Whitfield County Engineer.
(4)
Drainage facilities which are designed to accommodate flowing waters shall be hydraulically designed to function when subjected to the maximum flow rate which may be expected to occur no more often than once in ten years.
(5)
Drainage facilities which are designed to handle water accumulations shall be designed to accommodate the maximum water level which may be expected to occur no more often than once in 25 years. Necessary drainage facilities including, but not limited to, culverts, rights-of-way, and easements, shall be offered for dedication to Whitfield County.
(6)
All drainage systems discharging into any state waters, including but not limited to wetlands, as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shall pass through an approved sedimentation and detention pond prior to such discharge.
