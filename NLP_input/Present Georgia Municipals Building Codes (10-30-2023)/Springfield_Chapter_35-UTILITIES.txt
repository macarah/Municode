Such structure, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with approved plans. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. This requirement will be on a case-by-case basis.
(h)
The industrial users may be required to provide information needed to determine compliance with this article. These requirements may include:

(6)
Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities; and
(7)
Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials through spills to the public sewer.
(i)
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, provided all applicable local, state, and federal pretreatment standards are complied with.
(j)
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association. Sampling methods, location times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis, subject to approval by the city.
(k)
Pretreatment of wastes. Persons discharging industrial wastes into the sewerage system may be required to pretreat such wastes. Plans for all pretreatment facilities shall be approved by the superintendent and the state environmental protection division prior to construction. At the time written plans are submitted for approval, written maintenance plans shall be allowed to operate only as long as they are maintained in accordance with the approved maintenance plans. Pretreatment requirements shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and shall include the following facilities as a minimum:
(1)
Neutralization. If plans are submitted for the neutralization of strong acid or alkaline wastes, the plans shall include the necessary instrumentation and controls to ensure compliance with the above regulations at all times.

(3)
All pretreatment facilities shall be operated and maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(l)
Waiver of requirements. There shall be no provision for the granting of variances for discharge of incompatible wastes. If a user begins to violate any of the provisions of this section, it shall be his responsibility to apply to the superintendent who can issue a temporary permit along with a compliance schedule for planning and construction of necessary treatment or pretreatment works. Each case will be carefully evaluated with respect to its effect on the wastewater treatment system and the environment prior to issuance of a temporary permit and compliance schedule. Any dilution of the wastewater by the user for the purpose of decreasing the concentrations of toxic materials shall be considered a violation of this article.
(m)
Discontinuance of service for failure to comply. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article shall be cause for the discontinuance of sewer or water service to the offending person. The procedure shall be as follows: A written notice, signed by the superintendent, shall be delivered personally to the person then responsible for the offending use, outlining the conditions of the wastes which violate the city ordinances. In the event that the person in charge will not accept the notice, it shall be conveyed by registered mail to the responsible person. The person notified shall have 24 hours from the time of receipt of the notice, either personally delivered or received by registered mail, to correct the offending conditions. If correction is not made or a request for extension is not received by the city within 24 hours, it shall be mandatory that water and/or sewer service shall be discontinued to the offending person without further notice. If a request for an extension of time is received by the city within 24 hours of the above notice and if circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the superintendent, the best interests of the city would be served by extending the time for correction of the offending condition, then he may grant an extension of time up to a maximum limit of 30 days.
(n)
Responsibilities of the person discharging waste. It shall be the responsibility of the person discharging industrial waste into the city sewage system to:
(1)
Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
(2)
Contact the superintendent prior to operation changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling.
(3)
Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed in the city user charge system.
(o)
Discharge of cooling or condensing water to storm sewer systems may be allowed provided that a NPDES permit is obtained from the state EPD.
