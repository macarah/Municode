Sec. 5-331. - Site development standards.
(a)
Intent. The intent of these site development standards is to establish minimum standards for improvements to downtown properties. The purpose of these standards is to foster attractive development promoting consistency in design and materials, while recognizing the overall design of the downtown area as one of zero lot line development with shared public parking.
(b)
Vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems.
(1)
All new construction shall provide for sidewalks installed along public rights-of-way of no less than eight (8) feet in width, linking such site with adjacent sidewalks throughout the Downtown Business District.
(2)
Drive-in windows for commercial uses shall not be located on a building's principal facade and shall be shielded from view from the street on which the building fronts.
(3)
Curb-cuts for driveway installations shall be approved by the city engineering department and shall comply with city safety standards for distance from adjacent driveways and from the intersection of nearby public rights-of-way.
(c)
Loading areas. Loading areas shall be completely screened from view from the right-of-way on which the building faces. Where new construction permits sufficient space, loading areas shall be completely screened from view of users of public rights-of-way by masonry or stone walls, opaque fences or continuous vegetative buffers. Vegetative buffers shall be comprised of shrubs and tree species having dense foliage and of such size and spacing so as to form a continuous visual screen within two (2) years of installation of plant materials.
(d)
Site lighting.
(1)
All parking areas and walk-ways shall provide area lighting sufficient to achieve a minimum illumination of two and four-tenths (2.4) foot candles of light as measured at grade or ground level and recommended in the ISNA Lighting Handbook.
(2)
Lighting fixture height, style, design and illumination levels shall be compatible with the building design and height and shall consider safety, function and aesthetics.
(3)
Lighting shall be designed to prevent glare on adjacent properties, whether public or private.
(4)
Lighting may be used to illuminate buildings and grounds for safety purposes and to enhance appearance. The visual effects of such lighting shall be subtle.
(5)
Lighting attached to building exteriors or mounted on the ground to reflect upon building exteriors shall be consistent with the architectural style of the building.
(6)
Street lamps and freestanding lighting shall be consistent with existing street lighting installed on Main Street. All such lighting shall be approved by the City of College Park.
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01)
Sec. 5-332. - Awnings.
Many businesses in College Park originally had cloth or metal awnings to protect customers and merchandise from the elements. The use of traditional cloth or canvas awnings is permitted and encouraged. Awnings should be made of opaque material; i.e., canvas.
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01)
Sec. 5-333. - Windows.
Original windows are an important character-defining element. The shape of openings, the type of windows, and of light divisions (number of panes), are very important to the character of buildings. Owners wishing to replace windows should meet the following criteria:
(1)
Many old windows can be repaired rather than replaced. Repair should always be the first choice.
(2)
If new windows are required, they should require no major alterations of the opening.
(3)
New windows should match the original materials or replicate the same appearance. Wood windows, for example, should replace the original wood, metal should replace metal, and if the original wooden windows have been replaced with metal, wooden windows should replace the second-generation metal windows.
(4)
New windows should match the pane divisions of the original windows. For example, multi-paned sash windows should not be installed in buildings that originally had one over one sashes.
(5)
Care should be taken to obtain windows that fit original casings. In these cases, where possible, replacement sash rather than replacement of whole windows should be adhered to.
(6)
Bay windows are out of character in the Downtown Business District and therein shall not be located on the front of buildings or on facades visible from any public street.
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01)
Sec. 5-334. - Storm windows and doors.
Storm windows and doors are part of the reality of today for the energy conscious business owner. Due to the popularity of storm windows and doors, aesthetic preservation standards have been tempered to permit their use in accordance with the following safeguards:
(1)
Storm windows and doors should have minimal impact on building facades. Owners should consider proper weather-stripping and repairs first as an alternative to installation of storm doors and windows.
(2)
New storm doors and windows must match the color of the existing sash wherever possible.
(3)
Clear panes are recommended for storm doors which permit the original door to be fully visible.
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01)
Sec. 5-335. - Mechanical systems/satellite dishes.
Mechanical systems, including centralized air-conditioning units, shall be located at the rear of properties or inside existing alleys. They shall be shielded from public view by shrubs or, when appropriate, by fence enclosures.
Antennae, satellite dishes and other communications devices shall be visibly masked to the extent possible and must be compatible with the buildings on which they are mounted. Roof top mountings must be located at such distance from the front or visible side on buildings so as to preclude the installations being visible from the street or front elevation.
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01)
