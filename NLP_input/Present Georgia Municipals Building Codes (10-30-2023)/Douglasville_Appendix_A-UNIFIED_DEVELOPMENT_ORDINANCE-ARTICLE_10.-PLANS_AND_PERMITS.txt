Sec. 10.07. - Development permit.
A.
Responsibility for development actions.
1.
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity, including grading, clearing and grubbing, tree clearance, land development or project construction without first obtaining a development permit from the community development department to perform such activity. Such permit shall be on a form as provided by the city and shall include all information as identified in this subsection. The application shall be authorized by the property owner.
2.
The community development department is responsible for administering the review and approval process for issuance of development permits. The department shall forward a copy of the development permit application, including the civil design and constructions drawings for the project, to other departments, the Soil and Water Conservation Commission District, the Georgia Department of Transportation or others as appropriate, for their review and comment. The comments shall be sent to the applicant for resolution, and shall issue the development permit when all requirements of this UDO are met.
3.
Approval of plans by the community development department shall not imply or transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, architecture, landscape architecture or any other profession, from the professional, corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared.
4.
[Reserved.]
5.
The completion of inspections and authorization for work continuation shall not transfer responsibility for the quality of the work performed or materials used from the owner, nor imply or transfer acceptance of responsibility for project design or engineering from the professional, corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared.
6.
No development permit shall be interpreted to relieve any owner of the responsibility of maintaining full compliance with all applicable codes, ordinances and other regulations. Any development permit issued in error or in contradiction to the provisions of this UDO shall be considered to have been null and void upon its issuance.
7.
Liability.
a.
The approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan or other plans under the provisions of this development code, the issuance of a development permit, or the compliance with any other provisions of this UDO shall not relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the mayor and city council or the soil and water conservation district for damage to any person or property.
b.
The fact that any activity for which a development permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of, a violation of the standards provided for in this UDO or the terms of the development permit.
B.
Development activities authorized. A development permit shall be issued to authorize all activities associated with development activity regulated by this Code, subsequent to the issuance of a soil disturbance permit, including, but not limited to, the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, stormwater drainage facilities, sidewalks, or other structures permanently placed on or in the property except for buildings, signs, or other structures requiring the issuance of a building permit.
C.
Process for approval of development permit. An application for a development permit may proceed simultaneously with an application for a preliminary subdivision plat or site plan, but may not be issued prior to project approval of such plat or plan by the community development department.
1.
The application for a development permit shall be submitted to the community development department and must include the following:
a.
Application on the form furnished by the department, requesting review for issuance of a development permit.

3.
Upon acceptance of a development permit application, the community development department shall refer the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan to the soil and water conservation district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. No development permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances and bonding, if required, have been obtained.

If the development permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
3.
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate development permit shall be required for each phase.
4.
Approved civil design and construction plans. Three sets of reviewed plans shall be retained by the city for record purposes. All plans on the project site for the purpose of construction by contractors, subcontractors or the developer must be plans that are the plans most recently approved by the city as part of the current development permit. No construction other than clearing or rough grading may take place prior to review of the construction plans and then only if the developer has an approved erosion control plan.
5.
A holder of a development permit shall notify any successor in title to him or her as to all or any portion of the property affected by the approved plan regarding the conditions contained in the permit. Transfer of title to any permitted property, prior to termination of the permit, shall not act to release the original title and permit holder from liability for compliance with the terms of this chapter, unless and until such time as:

2)
The successor in title has complied with the bonding requirements of this section; and
3)
The city has approved transfer of the permit in writing. Any transfer of a permit under the authority of this subparagraph shall bind the successor permit holder to the same plan, requirements, variances, and permit conditions as the former permit holder. All successors in title to permitted properties shall request in writing a transfer of the permit or shall apply for a new permit contemporaneously with their receipt of title to the permitted property, or within 20 days thereafter; failure of a successor in title to comply with this requirement, whether or not the permit of the former title holder has been terminated, shall subject the successor in title to any and all penalties prescribed by this development code.

Maintenance of all soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices, whether temporary or permanent, shall be at all times the responsibility of the owner.
7.
Subsequent to issuance of a permit, and after all land-disturbing activity has ceased and the property has been stabilized to a permanent and continuous state of compliance with this chapter, the city shall inspect the property and shall terminate the permit and release the requirements for bond and/or letter of credit required by this section. The city shall make such inspections routinely in conjunction with inspections for release of paving bonds and issuance of certificates of occupancy where there is or has been construction in progress on the permitted property. For other permitted properties, inspections shall be made pursuant to request of the permit holder after payment of any required inspection fees.
8.
The development permit may be suspended, revoked or modified, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this development code.
F.
Deviation from or changes in plans.
1.
Upon completion of review of the civil design and construction plans, no deviations or changes from the reviewed plans shall be allowed without a complete resubmittal of the plans indicating the changes with a letter of explanation as to why the changes were necessary, along with any resubmittal fee as may be set by the mayor and city council from time to time.
