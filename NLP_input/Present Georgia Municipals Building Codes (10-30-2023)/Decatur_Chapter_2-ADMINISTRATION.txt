Editor's note— Ord. No. O-16-13, adopted Oct. 17, 2016, set out provisions intended for use as § 2-5. To maintain a consistent style for this Code, this section has been codified as Art.

DIVISION 1. - BASIS FOR CODE

Sec. 2-31. - Foundation.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve the public servant's own private standing. The principal policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are:
(a)
Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(b)
In speaking about the conduct of those in public service, or in responding to others who speak about it, express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior and refrain from unjustly despairing or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior.
(c)
Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of others.
(d)
Exercise sound judgment to act ethically in situations where others may be inclined to act unethically.
