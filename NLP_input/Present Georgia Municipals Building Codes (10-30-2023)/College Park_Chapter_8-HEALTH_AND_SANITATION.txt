(a)
Definition. A "nuisance" in general terms shall be construed to mean anything that causes hurt, inconvenience or damage to another, and the fact that the act done may otherwise be legal does not keep it from being a nuisance. The consequences complained of must not be fanciful or such as would only affect a person of fastidious tastes, but it must be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person. The definition of "nuisance" herein shall be in addition to all other definitions of nuisance contained in the Code and ordinances of the city.
(b)
Authority to abate. The city court shall have full power to order the abatement of any nuisance, whether public or private, within the city, and the appropriate city officials or the sheriffs of the counties or their deputies shall have full power and authority to execute the court's order.
(c)
Complaint, notice of hearing. When any nuisance exists in the city, any person affected thereby may apply or complain to the city court or the appropriate city official for abatement thereof, and it shall be the duty of the court or of the appropriate city official to cause to be issued reasonable notice of not less than four (4) days, to the parties interested, of the time and place of hearing. The complaint shall be in writing, shall specify the acts or thing complained of, and shall be signed by the person seeking the abatement. Notice of the hearing shall be in writing, shall be served upon the parties interested, and shall reasonably specify the nuisance sought to be abated. Such service may be personal or may be accomplished by leaving said notice at the residence of the parties interested.
(d)
Order to abate; execution for costs. When any person shall be convicted of creating or maintaining a nuisance, such person shall be ordered to abate such nuisance within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, and should such person fail or refuse to abide the court's order, it shall be the duty of the appropriate city official of the city to abate the same at the cost of the defendant. In any instance of failure or refusal to abate a nuisance after ordered to do so by the city court, and the abatement thereof by the appropriate city official, the cost thereof shall be collected by levy and sale as in cases of fines and forfeitures as provided elsewhere in this Code.
(e)
Issuance of execution. The execution provided for in subsection (d) shall be issued by the city clerk when the appropriate city official shall make affidavit stating the reasonable cost of abating the nuisance, and the execution shall issue for the reasonable cost or expense as shown by such affidavit.

Ambient noise: The all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment being usually a composite of sounds from many sources near and far. The sources of ambient noise are generally not considered to be objectionable, since their total noise output is low.
Band pressure level: For a specified frequency band, the sound pressure level for the sound contained within the restricted band. The reference pressure shall be specified.
Cycle: The complete sequence of values of a periodic quantity which occurs during a period.
Decibel (db): A unit of level which denotes the ratio between two (2) quantities that are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of two (2) amounts of power is ten (10) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of this ratio.
Emergency work: Work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect persons or property from an imminent exposure to danger.
Frequency: Of a function periodic in time, the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the cycle per unit time and shall be specified.
Microbar: A unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics, and which is equal to one dyne per square centimeter.
Period: With reference to a periodic quantity, it is the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself.
Periodic quantity: An oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time.
Sound analyzer: A device for measuring the bandpressure level or pressure spectrum level of a sound as a function of frequency.
Sound-level meter: An instrument, including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighing networks, for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner.
Sound pressure level: In decibels of a sound, twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure, which reference pressure shall be explicitly stated.
Spectrum: Of a function of time, a description of its resolution into components, each of a different frequency.
Time period: Denoted herein as 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., shall be deemed to refer to the nighttime hours commencing at 10:00 p.m. of one day and ending at 7:00 a.m. of the following day.

Sec. 8-56. - Findings.
(a)
The city council finds that public nuisances exist in the city in the operation of certain establishments and the use of property in violation of certain state statutes and this Code, which nuisances cause hurt, inconvenience or damage to others and substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in the quality of life and total community environment, commerce in the city, property values and the public health, safety and welfare.
(b)
The city council further finds:
(1)
That the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to the health sanitation, cleanliness, welfare and safety of the people of the city and of the businesses thereof and the visitors thereto, and
(2)
That the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is further detrimental to the peace, good order and dignity of the city and to the welfare and morals of the citizens of the city.
(c)
It is the purpose of the council, pursuant to provisions of article II of the City Charter, to authorize and empower the city court and officials of the city to impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances, and such power of such officials may be exercised either in conjunction with, or apart from, the powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures and remedies available under such other laws.
(d)
The council further finds that the sanctions and penalties imposed by the city pursuant to this article constitute an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The sanctions and penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health and safety of the people of the city and to promote the general welfare.
