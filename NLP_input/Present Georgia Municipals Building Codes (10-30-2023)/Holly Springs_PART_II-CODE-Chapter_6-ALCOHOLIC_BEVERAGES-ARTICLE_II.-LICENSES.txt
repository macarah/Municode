Exemption. The licensee to whom an alcoholic beverage license has been issued under this chapter is not required to pay an additional fee for a work permit.
(c)
Application and issuance. Subject to the time limit to make application for a work permit as provided herein, no person requiring a work permit may be employed with such responsibilities by an establishment holding a license under this chapter until such person has been issued a work permit from the Holly Springs Police Department. All applicants under this section shall be investigated by the police department, which may include, among other things, fingerprinting and an investigation of the criminal record, if any, of the applicant. No work permit shall be issued to any person who, within two years prior to the filing of the application for such permit has a felony violation or has violated any federal, state or local law, relating to the use or sale of drugs or alcoholic beverages. For purposes of this subsection, an indictment or a plea of nolo contendere shall constitute a violation. No work permit shall be issued by the police department if the applicant has violated any of the provisions of section 6-79 hereof. Any applicant who is not issued a work permit shall have the right to appeal such decision within ten business days to the administrator.
(d)
Time limit. All persons subject to the provisions of this section shall, within five business days after the date of their first day of employment in an establishment holding a license for alcoholic beverages, report to the police department for the purpose of applying for a work permit.

If it should be found that there is a violation of this chapter of the applicant, the chief of police shall refer the matter to the administrator for action and shall notify the employer that such person is not eligible for a work permit. When the administrator has heard the matter at a date and time to be determined by the administrator, he may issue a letter declaring such applicant to be eligible for a work permit if, in the discretion of the administrator, the record would not disqualify such person.
(f)
Term; fee. Any work permit issued under this section shall expire 12 months from the date of issuance unless suspended or revoked by the administrator. The police department may prescribe regulations certifying the eligibility for continued employment without the necessity of the employee being fingerprinted. The city shall charge a fee, set by the mayor and city council, for a work permit. The schedule of fees shall be included in the master fee schedule which is on file at the Holly Springs City Hall.
(g)
List of employees to be filed. It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police or his designee the names of all persons holding a work permit, with their home address, home telephone number and place of employment.

(h)
Possession of permits by employees. Permit holders shall at all times during their working hours have the permits available for inspection at the premises.
(i)
Permit holder on the premises. At all times that the business is open the licensee shall have at least one permit holder on the premises.

Grounds for suspension, revocation, probation.

A five-business day notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the administrator may deem the circumstances to be justified. "Due cause" for the suspension or revocation of the permit shall consist of the violation of any laws or ordinances regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages or the violation of any state, federal or local ordinances set out in this chapter; or for the omission or falsification of any facts in any application; or for any reason which would authorize the refusal of the issuance of a permit; or any violation of this chapter. All hearings shall be before the administrator at a specially called meeting and shall be conducted in the manner provided in section 6-62. After the hearing, if the administrator determines due cause exists, the administrator may suspend, revoke or place the applicant on probation for a maximum of 12 months, with or without conditions.
