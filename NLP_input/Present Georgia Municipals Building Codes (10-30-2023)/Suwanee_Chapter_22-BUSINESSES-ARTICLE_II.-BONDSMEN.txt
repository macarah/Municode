Sec. 22-60. - Financial qualifications.
(a)
Applicants seeking a certificate of authority to act as professional bonding entities in the city must qualify under one of the following provisions:
(1)
Real property. Applicants requesting permission to sign professional bail bonds by pledging their real property as collateral must do so in agreement with the chief of police. Such individual or entity must execute a deed to secure debt in favor of the chief of police to unencumbered real property within the county. Such deed shall be conditioned to allow the chief or his authorized agent to foreclose upon the default of the applicant by failure to pay any bond forfeiture judgment, subsequent to revocation of the certificate of authority, and subsequent to the depletion of any escrow account established in agreement with the chief of police for payment of such judgments. Such real property will be appraised by a qualified appraiser agreeable to the chief of police and the applicant will maintain title insurance in force on such property. Bondsmen may write bonds against the pledged property not to exceed one-half the unencumbered value of the property excluding homestead exemption on each parcel of property pledged. Bondsmen coming under this plan must comply with the same requirements placed on individuals signing property bonds.
(2)
Escrow accounts. Applicants may sign an agreement with the chief of police providing for an escrow account in a federally insured savings and loan or commercial bank located within the county. The escrow agent shall be authorized to pay the chief of police the sum of any unsatisfied fi fa presented to the escrow agent by the chief of police or his authorized agent, subsequent to entry of the judgment on the general execution docket of the county and subsequent to 30 days from the date of mailing to the individual authorized to receive process for the bonding entity. This escrow shall be ten percent of the company's bonding capacity and shall not be less than $20,000.00. Any interest generated by such an account must revert to the applicant since the chief of police or the city is not authorized under state law to receive such interest. Escrow accounts will remain open until all bonds signed by the bonding entity under such an agreement are satisfied.
(3)
Insurance companies. Applicants wishing to write bail bonds under the requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33 provisions, must be approved and be currently certified by the state insurance commissioner. A copy of such certificate shall be provided with the application. The applicant's insurance company must be approved by the insurance commissioner and meet all requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33, to do business in the state. Agents of such companies will provide copies of their current individual certificate of authorization to the bonding administrator appointed by the chief of police. Insurance companies will not at any time exceed a 3:1 net written premium to policy holder surplus ratio or it must collateralize any further bonds. Net written premiums will be defined as the company's gross writings less those writings reinsured. "Policy holder surplus" is defined as what is left out of admitted assets once all liabilities have been satisfied. O.C.G.A. § 33-3-17(6) requires payment of any final judgments within 30 days and failure to do so may also result in further action under O.C.G.A. § 33-3-20.
(Ord. No. 120-A, § 7, 8-16-1988)

(Ord. No. 120-A, § 8, 8-16-1988)
Sec. 22-62. - Procedures.
(a)
Each bondsman must be licensed by the state department of insurance. Any temporary status or licensing must be approved by the city attorney's office.
(b)
A bondsman must not solicit business in or around the jail office or where prisoners are confined. If while at the jail on business a bondsman is asked if he is a bondsman, he may answer in the affirmative and conduct business in the normal manner. The initiative must be on the part of the inmate or the public.
(c)
All bondsmen must sign the sign-in book when entering the jail for the purpose of doing business as a bondsman.
(d)
When called to come to the jail to write a bond, it is recommended that bondsmen call the jail and advise them they are coming, name of the inmate and his estimated time of arrival. This should preclude the problem of several bondsmen responding to the same call. The jail staff have been instructed to advise the second bondsman calling for the same inmate of the previous call, thereby eliminating unnecessary response to the jail.
(e)
All bondsmen using insurance companies will provide a serialized power of attorney from the surety stating the limits of liability. A power of attorney must be provided with every bond written. These powers of attorney must be serialized and state a value covering the amount of the bond to be written.
(f)
All bonding companies must provide a monthly statement to the chief of police by the 15th of the month with the name of each defendant actively on bond, the amount of the bonds, the number of the power of attorney, the date the bond was made and the current status of each bond.
(g)
No bondsman may pay a fee, come to any arrangement with or give anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee that works for the city without specific written permission of the mayor and city council.
(h)
An insurer terminating the appointment of a bondsman shall file a written notice of termination with the chief of police. This notice shall state the reasons, if any, for termination.
(i)
Each bondsman shall charge a fee no more or less than that specified by state statutes. No professional bondsman, his agents or his employees who receive compensation for becoming the surety on a criminal bond shall thereafter receive any other sum in the case. If, before final disposition of the case, the surety surrenders the defendant who is the principal on the bond into the custody of the court, he must first return to the principal the compensation received for signing the bond as surety.
(j)
Professional bondsmen, their agents or employees shall not advise defendants, principals in bonds signed by them, or give any directions in the defense or disposition of the cases in which bonds are signed.
(k)
When a fi fa is issued, the bonding companies will be given 30 days before levy process is implemented against escrow accounts. If, at the end of 30 days the fi fa has not been satisfied, bonding privileges will be suspended. Suspension of bonding privileges for this reason is administrative and not punitive. The state insurance commission will be notified for whatever actions it deems necessary in the case of insurance companies.
(l)
Any violation of these procedures may result in the suspension of privileges pending an investigation of the violation. If, after an investigation the violation is substantiated, revocation of future privileges may result. If it is found that the violation did not occur as alleged or suspected, the suspension will be lifted. Any allegations of procedure violations must be submitted in writing to the chief of police for consideration.
(m)
A copy of these procedures will be incorporated into and maintained within the detention services policy and procedures manual:
(1)
If a person has no other way to post bond and must hire a professional bondsman, it is his responsibility to choose a bonding company. It is also his responsibility to contact the bonding company he has chosen. No employee is allowed to contact any bondsman or bonding company on behalf of anyone under arrest, even if the person under arrest should request the employee to do so.
(2)
Under no circumstances is an employee allowed to recommend a bondsman or bonding company.
(3)
If a bondsman calls and wishes to be notified when a certain person is brought in, the request shall be refused.
(4)
No employee on duty, engaged in accepting bonds, should converse with a bondsman any more than is necessary to complete the transaction at hand.
(5)
After signing the bond, the bondsman must leave the jail property unless the bondsman has legitimate business with someone else in the department who is not on duty to accept bonds.
(6)
No bondsman will be allowed to enter the book-in area without specific approval of the shift supervisor or his superior.
(7)
No bondsman will be allowed to view any records, receipts or files unless they pertain to his immediate client and such information is deemed necessary by a shift supervisor or his superior.
(8)
No bondsman will be allowed to leave business cards, memo pads or other forms of advertisement around the jail. Bonding company signs will be rotated once a week in an orderly fashion.
(9)
No employee shall give special consideration to any one particular bonding company. An employee shall remain impartial at all times.
