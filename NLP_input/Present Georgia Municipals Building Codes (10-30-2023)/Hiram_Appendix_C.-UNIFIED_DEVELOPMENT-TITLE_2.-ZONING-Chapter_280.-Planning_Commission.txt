Sec. 280-100. - Reversion Standards for Amendments.
280-100.01
Purpose and Intent. Any amendment, whether a rezoning, special use permit, or land use permit requires a public hearing process. The public hearing process provides the opportunity and forum for citizens, affected landowners, and the general public to review and speak to public hearing cases. The participation by the public in the public hearing process provides valuable input in the outcome of cases and is a vital part of the decision-making process. The public should be confident that a project approved through the public hearing process will be completed as represented and approved unless otherwise properly amended or modified. Transparency with the decisions rendered by the Planning Commission and City Council is essential, so that the public hearing process has integrity and dependability.
Once an amendment is approved, the applicant should diligently pursue the improvements associated with the granting of an amendment through completion. If improvements cannot be completed as approved, an applicant should submit another request and pursue the public hearing process again or seek additional remedies available under the UDO. Inaction or the lack of productivity over time begins to cast doubt on both the integrity of the public hearing process as well as the proposal submitted by the applicant and considered by the City Council to gain the approval.
At the same time, once approved by City Council, applicants must be able to depend on amendments as they pursue projects. Applicants need reasonable flexibility to meet consumer demand and adjust to market forces. Additionally, applicants face a host of challenges to complete projects including but not limited to delays created by regulatory factors, transactions, weather, utility relocations, and other extenuating circumstances. Applicants should be afforded the opportunity to develop realistic schedules that meet project needs with the ability to adjust these schedules and request additional time to complete projects as conditions warrant.
Therefore, these regulations set forth in this Section are intended:
A.
To balance the needs of development with the transparency and integrity demanded by the public hearing process;
B.
To provide for reversion standards for amendments including the process for requesting and granting extensions;
C.
To mitigate land speculation at the expense of the general public;
D.
To establish the timing of projects in accordance with a set schedule decided and agreed upon by the applicant and the City Council;
E.
To ensure an approved amendment continues to be consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan and current land development codes of the City;
F.
To provide general requirements setting forth the length of time an amendment remains valid;
G.
To provide for notice, transparency, flexibility, and due process for applicants as they pursue projects enabled by amendments;
H.
To set forth an overall framework of project delivery and execution with a project or use approved with an amendment for the benefit of the applicant, the citizens, and the general public.
280-100.02
Amendment TypesโExpiration. Zoning Amendments and Special Use Permits initiated by the property owner shall expire in accordance with this Section.
280-100.03
Reversion of Amendments.
A.
Amendment Completion Schedule. Commencing on or after March 7, 2023, the City Council may approve an amendment conditioned upon the completion of a project schedule proposed by the applicant. The project schedule shall be adopted upon with the approval of an amendment and include a project commencement date, substantial progress date, and completion date. The project must achieve substantial progress by the date indicated or the amendment will expire and revert in accordance with provisions of this Section. The applicant may request an extension from City Council in accordance with Section 280-100.03.E.
B.
Amendment Term. In the absence of an amendment completion schedule, amendments shall expire according to the following provisions:
1.
Commencement. A project must be commenced as evidenced by a current valid permit for construction within three years or receive a Certificate of Occupancy within three years from the date of amendment approval by the City Council, whichever is sooner, otherwise the amendment shall expire. The applicant may request a time extension from City Council in accordance with Section 280-100.03.E.
2.
Substantial Progress. Once a project is commenced by obtaining a valid permit for construction upon passage, the applicant has 12 months to achieve substantial progress, in accordance with the approved project plans or the amendment shall expire. The applicant may request a time extension from City Council in accordance with Section 280-100.03.E.
C.
Reversion Process. Absent full reinstatement as defined in Section 280-100.03.D below or extension as defined in Section 280-100.03.E, upon the concurrence of the failure to meet the timing of commencement of project described in Section 280-100.03.B.1, obtaining a valid construction permit, obtaining a certificate of occupancy, or obtaining substantial progress as described in Section 280-100.03.B.2, the amendment shall automatically be reverted to its original zoned classification and conditions. Should the Director determined that the original zoned classification be incapable of being returned to a constitutionally permissible classification, then the Director shall provide notice to the applicant and former property owner and shall contemporaneously file a request with the Planning Commission to request advertisement and notice to commence rezoning of the parcel which shall be accomplished in accordance with the process prescribed in Chapter 280.
D.
Reinstatement. From the date the amendment expires until the reversion is approved by City Council, an applicant may request the reinstatement of an amendment and an extension to complete the project, if submitted in accordance with Section 280-100.03.E. Any reversion shall be tolled until the date the City Council renders a decision on the request.
E.
Extension Request Process; Standards. To avoid reversion, one or more extension(s) of time may be requested by filing a written request with the Community Development Department at least 30 days prior to an amendment expiration date. The written request shall include the reasons for the extension request, amount of time requested for the extension, proposed project completion schedule based on the extension request, and the payment of a fee set by resolution of the City Council.
An extension may be granted by the City Council. In deciding to extend an amendment, the City Council may consider any of the following standards:
1.
The applicant can document a significant monetary investment in the project to date;
2.
The applicant can demonstrate reasonable progress to date on the completion of the project;
3.
The applicant has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith to complete the project and conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application;
4.
Extenuating circumstances exist including but not limited to documented delays caused by weather, health, utilities, approvals from other governmental agencies, and local or national emergencies;
5.
Performance by the applicant in the past to complete projects and the number of extensions previously requested.
F.
Granting of Right-of-Way. As approved by City Council on a case- by-case basis, whenever an applicant consents as a condition to the granting of an amendment to the conveyance of additional right-of-way to the City, such conveyance shall be completed within 90 days of the approval of the amendment at the applicant's expense; failure to complete conveyance to the City shall cause the immediate reversion of the amendment on any such parcel to its previous zoning classification.
200-80.04
Special Use PermitsโPerformance. An approved Special Use Permit shall become null and void if no building permit to construct the project has been issued within 12 months of the date of approval by the City Council. A Special Use Permit for which no building permit is required shall become null and void if the use is not established and operational with an Occupation Tax Certificate issued by the City within 12 months of the date of approval by the City Council. An extension may be requested in accordance with Section 200-80.03.E.
