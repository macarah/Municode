Such notice to councilmembers shall not be required if the mayor and all councilmembers are present when the special meeting is called. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting and attendance at the meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice on any business transacted in such councilmember's presence.

(c)
Public request for agenda item. Members of the public may request that a particular subject be placed on the agenda for a meeting.

An abstention shall be counted as an affirmative vote [Reference: Section 2.21 City Charter].
(b)
Mayor. The mayor shall vote only in the case of a tie or in the case where his or her vote will provide the third affirmative vote required for approval of a matter. The purpose of this paragraph is to preserve the presiding officer's necessary position of impartiality and help preserve an objective and impersonal approach.
(c)
Abstention. No member of the city council shall abstain from voting on any matter properly brought before the city council for official action, except when such member of city council has a conflict of interest which is disclosed in writing prior to or at the meeting and made a part of the minutes.

(Ord. No. 18-02, § 1, 2-26-18)
Sec. 2-37. - Public comment.
(a)
At every regular meeting of the city council (work session and voting session), the floor shall be open for public comments at one point during the meeting. The public comments section will last a maximum of 30 minutes, and speakers' comments will be limited to three minutes each. Individuals will be held to established time limits.
(b)
All members of the public wishing to address the city council shall submit their name and the topic of their comments to the city clerk prior to the start of any meeting held by the city council.
(c)
A member of the public shall not be authorized to comment on a matter for which a public hearing has been or will be held during the same meeting.
(d)
Comments shall be addressed to the mayor or other presiding officer.
(e)
The time limits established in this section may be waived by a majority vote of the city council.
(Ord. No. 18-02, § 1, 2-26-18)
Sec. 2-38. - Motions.
(a)
Gaining the floor. Before a councilmember can make a motion or speak in debate, he or she must obtain the floor, or in other words, be recognized by the presiding officer as having the exclusive right to be heard at that time. The presiding officer must recognize, with a mere nod or a formal statement recognizing the councilmember, any councilmember who seeks the floor while entitled to it.
(b)
Introduction. After being recognized by the presiding officer, any councilmember can introduce a motion when no other motion is being considered. A motion should begin with the words "I move that…" When necessary, a motion can be prefaced by a few words of explanation, which must not become a speech.
(c)
Second. All motions, except for a point of order, require a second to be debated or considered. If there is no second, the presiding officer normally asks, "is there a second to the motion?" A motion that does not get seconded dies for lack of a second. To second a motion, a councilmember shall state "I second the motion" or "I second it" or, simply, "second." It is not necessary to obtain the floor to second a motion. A second merely implies that the motion should come before the council and not necessarily favoring a motion. A councilmember may second a motion "for discussion purposes only" and vote against the motion.
(d)
Clarification. The presiding officer shall ensure the motion is offered in wording that is clear. If the motion is not clear to the presiding officer, it is the duty of the presiding officer to see that the motion is put into suitable form. Also, if the motion is unclear to a councilmember, he or she can ask that the motion be repeated, which the presiding officer can request the maker or the city clerk to do, or can do himself or herself. Until the chair states the question, the maker has the right to modify his motion as he or she pleases or to withdraw it entirely.
(e)
Statement of question on the motion. Unless the wording of a motion is unclear or is out of order, the presiding officer will state the question (repeat the motion). When the presiding officer has stated the question, the motion is pending or "on the floor" for debate and discussion.
(f)
Debate. Discussion on a motion does not take place until a second of the motion is made. Councilmembers shall address the mayor (or presiding officer), or address each other through the mayor or presiding officer. Debate must be confined to the merits of the question. If a councilmember strays from the motion being discussed, the presiding officer shall ask the councilmember to confine his or her remarks to the merits of the pending question. The councilmember making a motion shall have the right to speak first in debate, if he or she wishes, after the presiding officer has stated the question. No councilmember is entitled to the floor a second time in debate on the same motion on the same day as long as another councilmember who has not spoken on the motion desires the floor. The presiding officer cannot interrupt a person who has the floor so long as that person does not violate any of the council's rule and no disorder arises. The presiding officer cannot close debate so long as any councilmember who has not exhausted the right to debate desires the floor, except by order of the city council which requires a two-thirds vote.
(g)
Amendment. A motion may be amended. Amendments to motions typically involve only the addition or deletion of words. If a motion is made and seconded to amend a motion, discussion ensues on the amendment first, then on the original motion as amended.
(h)
Substitution. An alternative motion that is more than a simple addition or deletion of words may be offered as a substitute. If a motion is made and seconded to substitute a motion, discussion will continue on both motions and eventually the council will vote on the motion the councilmembers prefer.
(i)
Postponement. A motion may be made to postpone a matter to a future meeting.
(j)
Withdrawal. A motion may be withdrawn under the following circumstances: (1) the councilmember making the motion requests a withdrawal, and (2) the councilmember seconding the motion agrees to the withdrawal, and (3) either the council votes to accept the withdrawal, or the presiding officer asks if councilmembers objects to the motion's being withdrawn and if no one objects, the chair announces: "The motion is withdrawn."
(k)
Adoption or rejection. Each motion must be disposed of (approved, disapproved, postponed, etc.). When debate appears to have ended, the presiding officer will call for a vote on the motion. This will normally be done with the question "there being no further discussion, are you ready for the question? The presiding officer may once more make clear the motion that is before the city council to decide. Then, the presiding officer will ask "those in favor of the motion, say aye. Those opposed, say no." Motions are decided by majority vote. The presiding officer announces the result of the vote. A tie vote rejects the motion. If the motion carries, it is adopted. If the council expressly decides against doing what the motion proposes, the motion is lost, or rejected.
(Ord. No. 18-02, § 1, 2-26-18)
Sec. 2-39. - Board and commission appointments.
As soon as a vacancy exists on an established board or commission of the city, the city manager shall place on next available work session agenda of the city council notice of said vacancy. Unless the procedure for appointment is otherwise prescribed by ordinance, the mayor will accept nominations for the vacant board or commission appointment. The appointment will be filled by majority vote of the city council.

Sec. 2-74. - Exemptions.
This Code shall not be construed to require the filing of any information relating to any person's connection with, or interest in, any professional society or any charitable, religious, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, civil or political organization, or any similar organization not conducted as a business enterprise or governmental agency, and which is not engaged in the ownership or conduct of a business enterprise or governmental agency.

Sec. 2-75. - Acceptance of gifts, gratuities, special privileges.
(a)
Employees shall not accept any gifts, loans, rewards, favors, or services that may reasonably tend to improperly influence them in the discharge of their official duties. This limitation is not intended to prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value, which are distributed generally nor to prohibit employees from accepting loans from regular lending institutions. It is particularly important that employees guard against relationships that might be construed as or give the appearance of favoritism, coercion, unfair advantage or collusion.
(b)
Employees shall not use or attempt to use their position to secure an economic benefit or advantages, special privileges or exemptions for themselves or others including the use of knowledge obtained by or through their employment or by virtue of their position.
(c)
Employees shall not accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which they may reasonably expect would require or induce them to disclose confidential information acquired by them by reason of their official position.
(d)
Employees shall not accept payment from outside sources for professional services (i.e., teaching, instructing, speaking engagements, consulting, honorariums) when such activities are done on city time or when such services pertain to the purchase or sale of city property.
(Ord. of 9-10-2001, art. IX)
Sec. 2-76. - Outside employment.
(a)
City employment shall be considered to be the primary employment of all full-time employees. No employee may engage in outside employment that will interfere with the interest of city service. Standards by which some employment is not acceptable include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Illegal activity;
(2)
Employment that, by virtue of association, will reflect upon the reputation of the city; or
(3)
High hazard of fatiguing work, which might detract from or reduce city performance.
(b)
Prior to beginning any regularly scheduled outside employment, employees will obtain specific written approval from their department head or his designee on request forms which indicate the name of the outside employer, the nature of the work, hours of work, address and telephone number where the employee can be reached. Such information will become a part of the employee's official personnel record. Employees are required to obtain approval from their department head or his designee for any change in a previously approved outside employment request.
(c)
Any employee accepting or engaging in outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make arrangements with the outside employer to be available immediately to any emergency call of duty whenever the department head or his designee shall determine that the employee's services are necessary.
(d)
Employees sustaining injuries while engaged in outside employment are normally ineligible to receive benefits under the city's worker's compensation program. If an employee sustains an injury while engaged in outside employment, but is performing duties, within the scope of his city responsibilities (i.e., a police arrest), he may be eligible for partial city worker's compensation benefits.
(e)
Failure to comply with the provisions of this section will result in disciplinary action.
