State Law reference— Advanced Broadband Collocation Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-1 et seq.

Sec. 42-475. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Telecommunications Towers and Antennas Ordinance."
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 96-06, § 1(18.0), 11-11-1996; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-476. - Purpose, findings, goals.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of telecommunications towers and antennas, and the facilities whereon such towers or antennas are located.
(b)
Findings. The mayor and council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunications towers and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While mandated to make such provisions, the mayor and council also recognize that telecommunications towers and antennas can negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and can reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such towers, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas.
(c)
Goals. The goals of this article, therefore, are to:
(1)
Express the intent of the mayor and council that the construction of new towers be an option of last resort and, to the extent feasible, location of antennas on existing towers, building rooftops, and other suitable structures should first be sought;
(2)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(3)
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(5)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to construct them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers or antennas;
(6)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures;
(7)
Develop an inventory of existing sites with specific information about the load capacity of each existing site, remaining developable land area available at the site, and any terms or conditions of the lease which would affect the possibility of collocation at the site; and
(8)
Provide for the disposition of towers which are abandoned by all users, and set forth the time period within which the requirements would apply and responsibility for the removal of abandoned towers.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 96-06, § 1(18.1), 11-11-1996; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alternative tower structure means manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
Building inspector means the building inspector for the city.
FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.
Guy tower means a tower that is supported, in whole or in part, by guy wires and ground anchors.
Height, when referring to a tower, antenna, or other structure, means the distance measured vertically from the highest point when positioned for operation to the lowest point which is defined as the average ground elevation along the structure being measured at either roof or ground level, whichever is applicable. The height of a tower shall include the height of any antenna positioned for operation attached or which may be attached to the highest point on the tower.
Lattice or self-supporting tower means a tower that has open-framed supports on three or four sides and is constructed without guy wires and ground anchors.
Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
Preexisting towers and antennas means any tower, antenna, or monopole for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
Telecommunications facility means a telecommunications tower, a monopole tower, an antenna or any and all buildings, structures, or other supporting equipment used in connection with a telecommunications tower, a monopole tower, or an antenna.
Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers or guy towers. The term "tower" includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like, but specifically excludes monopole towers.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 96-06, § 1(18-2), 11-11-1996; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-478. - Conditional use permit required.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, repair, relocate, construct, or maintain within the city any telecommunications facility without first obtaining a conditional use permit in the manner set forth in this article or otherwise complying with the terms herein.
(b)
District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to such structures, as specified in each zoning district, shall not apply to antennas, monopoles and towers.
(c)
The guidelines set forth in this article shall control the installation of all antennas and the location of all towers governed by this article; provided, however, that the mayor and council may waive or vary the terms of these requirements during the conditional use permit application review process if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. In considering a conditional use permit, the city may impose additional conditions to the extent the city concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect the proposed antenna or tower may have on adjoining properties.

(9)
The monopole tower complies with all current safety, design, structural, and wind loading standards of applicable building and technical codes adopted by the city, so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents.
(10)
Accessory or principal uses are as follows:
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a monopole shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a monopole shall not be stored or parked on the site of the monopole, unless repairs to the monopole are being made.
b.
Monopoles may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation, and general requirements of this article are met, monopoles may occupy a leased parcel on a site meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. When joint use of a lot is permitted, the city shall require the execution of a unity of title if two or more lots are utilized for setback purposes or to prohibit the unlawful division of a lot containing a monopole and another principal use. The minimum distance between a monopole and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 60 feet or the 100 percent breakpoint of the monopole. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
