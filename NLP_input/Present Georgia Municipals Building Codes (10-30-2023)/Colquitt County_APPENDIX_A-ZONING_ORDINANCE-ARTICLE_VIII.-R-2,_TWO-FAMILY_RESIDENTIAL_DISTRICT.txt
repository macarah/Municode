ARTICLE VIII. - R-2, TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Section 8.01. - Statement of purpose.
The two-family residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single- and two-family dwellings based upon a plan to make the most appropriate use of scattered parcels of land within neighborhoods or on major thoroughfares. The specific intent of this article is to insure that only such residential uses as can be properly designed and built will be allowed in this district so as not to overcrowd the land, cause parking or traffic congestion, or to have injurious effects on adjacent single-family residential property.
