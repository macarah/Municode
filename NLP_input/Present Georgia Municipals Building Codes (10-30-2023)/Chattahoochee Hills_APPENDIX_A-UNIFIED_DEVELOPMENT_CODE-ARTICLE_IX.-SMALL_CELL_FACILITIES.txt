ARTICLE IX. - SMALL CELL FACILITIES

Sec. 9-1. - Defined.
Radio transceivers; surface wave couplers; antennas; coaxial, fiber optic, or other cabling; power supply; backup batteries; and comparable and associated equipment, regardless of technological configuration, at a fixed location or fixed locations that enable communication or surface wave communication between user equipment and a communications network and that meet both of the following qualifications: (a) each wireless provider's antenna could fit within an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet in volume; and (b) all other wireless equipment associated with the facility is cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, measured based upon the exterior dimensions of height by width by depth of any enclosure that may be used. The following types of associated ancillary equipment are not included in the calculation of the volume of all other wireless equipment associated with any such facility: electric meters; concealment elements; telecommunications demarcation boxes; grounding equipment; power transfer switches; cut-off switches; and vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services. Such terms do not include a pole, decorative pole, or support structure on, under, or within which the equipment is located or collocated or to which the equipment is attached and do not include any wireline backhaul facilities or coaxial, fiber optic, or other cabling that is between small wireless facilities, poles, decorative poles, or support structures or that is not otherwise immediately adjacent to or directly associated with a particular antenna.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 9-2. - Applicability.
A.
This article only applies when small cell facilities are attached to an existing structure.
B.
Small cell facilities that are not attached to an existing structure are subject to Art. X.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 9-3. - Permit required.
A permit is required to install a small wireless facility in the city, except no permit is required to perform the activities described in O.C.G.A. § 36-66C-6(e) or (f).
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 9-4. - Use standards.
A.
Small cell facilities may only be installed:
1.
On streetlight or mast arms mounted on pre-existing poles, including utility and street light poles or other pre-existing exterior support structures;
2.
On the wall of a building facing the rear lot line at a height of at least 20 feet in a residential district or when mounted on a residential building, or 15 feet in a nonresidential or when mounted to a commercial building; and
3.
On the roof of a building.
4.
No portion of the facility may exceed the building height limits of the zoning district.
B.
Antennas located at the top of poles and support structures must be incorporated into the pole or support structure or placed within shrouds of a size such that the antenna appears to be part of the pole or support structure.
C.
Antennas placed elsewhere on a pole or support structure must be integrated into the pole or support structure or be designed and placed to minimize visual impacts.
D.
Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and mounted on a pole must be placed as high as possible, located to avoid interfering with or creating any hazard to any other use of the public right-of-way, and located on one side of the pole. Unless the radio units or equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic signage, radio units, or equipment cabinets mounted below the communications space on poles, they must be designed so that the largest dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite side of the pole on which they are placed.
E.
Wiring and cabling must be neat and concealed within or flush to the pole or support structure, ensuring concealment of these components to the greatest extent possible.
F.
Public property.
1.
City property. A private small cell facility may be located on the exterior of public property or attached to an existing support structure owned or operated by the city. The use of any property owned or operated by the city will be at the discretion of the city council and may not be subject to the same conditions and requirements as are applicable to such facilities on privately owned property. The city council may, but is not required to, hold a public hearing before its decision to allow the use of property owned or under the control of the city.
2.
Non-city right-of-way. A private small cell facility may be located in a right-of-way that is owned or operated by a county government, the State of Georgia, or the federal government, subject to the approval of the applicable government.
3.
Other public property. A private small cell facility may be located in public property, other than a right-of-way, that is owned or operated by a county, state, federal, or other governmental agency subject to the same conditions and requirements as are applicable to such facilities on privately owned property.
G.
No lights are permitted on any antenna unless required by the Federal Communications Commission, the FAA, or the city.
H.
Every small cell facility must be removed at the cost of the owner when it is no longer in use or when it has not been operated for a continuous period of six months. Such a facility must be removed within 90 days after receiving a removal notice from the city.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 9-5. - Procedures.
A.
The applicant must provide proof that it is a licensed provider and will comply with all applicable federal, state, and city laws and regulations, including those regarding wireless communications services.
B.
Within 30 days of the date an application is filed with the city, the zoning administrator must notify the applicant in writing of any information required to complete the application. If additional information is required, the time required by the applicant to provide such information will not be counted toward the 90-day review period set forth in this clause.
C.
In determining whether to issue a special administrative permit allowing the installation of a small cell facility on an existing structure, the zoning administrator will consider the following factors and decide if it is appropriate:
1.
Demonstrated need for the small cell technologies within the geographic area requested in order to deliver adequate service.
2.
Proof that all co-location sites in the area of need are/were pursued and have been denied; or that there does not exist the ability to co-locate using existing structures. The applicant must demonstrate all actions taken to achieve co-location.
3.
The character of the area in which the small cell technology wireless support structure is requested, including evidence of surrounding properties and uses.
4.
Stealth technology, if any, proposed to be utilized by the applicant, or proof that stealth technology is either unnecessary or cannot be used.
5.
Proof that the proposed small cell technology wireless support structure is the minimal physical installation that will achieve the applicant's goals.
6.
The safety and aesthetic impact of: any proposed small cell technology wireless support structure; related accessory equipment; and/or equipment compound.
D.
The city has 90 days from receipt of a completed application for a small cell system to make a final decision of approval or disapproval. If the application is incomplete, the zoning administrator must notify the applicant within ten days of application submission. At that time, the 90-day clock stops and is reset to zero. Upon submittal of a completed application, the 90-day clock will start. Within 90 days of the date a completed application is filed with the city, the city must:
1.
Complete the review;
2.
Make a final decision of approval or disapproval; and
3.
Advise the applicant in writing of the final decision, including the specific reason for said decision based on the applicable factors in this section.
E.
Within 60 days of the date of a complete application is filed with the city for attaching equipment to a structure which is part of an existing small cell system, the city must:
1.
Complete the review;
2.
Make a final decision of approval or disapproval; and
3.
Advise the applicant in writing of the final decision, including the specific reason for said decision based on these small cell facility standards.
