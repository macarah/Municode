CHAPTER 17.48 - RCD RESIDENTIAL CONDOMINIUM DISTRICT

Sections:
17.48.010 - Purpose.
This district is composed of certain lands in the City intended to be used primarily for medium density, multi-family dwellings. The development may be under condominium, individual or cooperative ownership with or without the subdivision of the land parcel into individual lots and blocks and where there may be commonly owned areas for the joint use of the residents.
(Ord. of 9-16-1985, (part))
17.48.020 - Density and spacing requirements.
A maximum of eight multiple-family dwelling units per acre is permitted in an RCD district with a maximum of six units in any one contiguous building. A distance of 30 feet is required between buildings and no building shall be located closer than 30 feet from a property line. Provided, however, where a developer has a tract of land that contains some land that cannot be built upon, the developer may then build up to 14 units per acre on the land that is usable. However, in this case the maximum density shall be no more than seven units per acre of total land. For this purpose the total land that can be built upon shall not include rivers, streams and floodplain.
(Ord. of 9-16-1985, (part))

Two off-street paved parking spaces shall be required per unit.

A planted buffer strip shall be maintained on all boundaries of the RCD district except the street boundary line.
