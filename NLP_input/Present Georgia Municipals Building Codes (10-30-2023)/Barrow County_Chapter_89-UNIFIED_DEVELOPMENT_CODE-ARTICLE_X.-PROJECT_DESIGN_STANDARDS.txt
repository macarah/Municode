ARTICLE X. - PROJECT DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 89-1175. - Purpose of article.
This article sets out the minimum requirements and standards for construction of subdivisions and other land development projects, including general principles of design and layout and requirements for such public facilities as streets and utilities.
While building officials examine land development project plans for compliance with the technical codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances, the owner shall ultimately remain responsible for the design of the project. Notwithstanding the building official's role in accepting and approving submissions specified in this ordinance, the owner is not entitled to rely on approval from the county of any documents as evidence that the plans are all internally consistent or compliant with applicable health and safety codes and standards. Nothing herein is intended to create an actionable duty on the part of the building officials.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1176. - Standards incorporated by reference.
(a)
The Standard Design Specifications of Barrow County, also referred to in this Development Code as "standard details", as adopted by the board of commissioners and as may be amended from time to time are incorporated into this Development Code as though set forth within the body of this Development Code. In the case of a conflict between the standard design specifications and the text of this Development Code, the text of this Development Code shall control.
(1)
Traffic signs and street striping. The installation of all traffic control signs and street striping shall be governed by the standards contained in the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices", latest edition, published by the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
(2)
Georgia DOT standard specifications. Unless otherwise specially set forth in this Development Code or the Standard Design Specifications of Barrow County, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction and storm drainage construction shall conform to the latest standard specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(3)
AASHTO design standards. Design criteria and standards not specifically set forth herein shall conform to the latest edition of the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
(4)

(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1177. - Interpretation of standards.
In the interpretation and application of the provisions of these standards, the following shall govern:
(a)
Governing standards. Whenever a provision of these standards or any provision in any law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of any kind contains any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, the standards that are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
(b)
Prior acceptance of construction plans. Barrow County shall not modify or alter any development plans that have been filed with and accepted by the county prior to the effective date of this Development Code. This exception shall be subject to the conditions and limitations under which said plans were accepted by the county.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1178. - Design exceptions and field changes.
(a)
Request for design exception. When unique conditions and circumstances exist on a project, the developer's engineer may submit a request for design exception in a format provided by the director of public works. Design exceptions request should be identified as early as possible during the design process. The director of public works is the approval authority for design exceptions.
(b)
Field changes. Minor changes in construction plans caused by field conditions shall be made at the direction of the director of public works with the cost of such changes to be paid by the developer. All changes are to be documented as revisions to the approved development plans and correctly shown on the as-built surveys. Discrepancies between the as-built surveys and the approved development plans may result in delays in approving final plats or certificates of occupancy.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1179. - General design standards.
(a)
Suitability of the land.
(1)
Land physically unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, poor drainage, topographic, geologic or other such features that may endanger health, life or property, aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard, or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services shall not be approved for subdivision or development unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for solving the problems. Such land shall be set aside for such uses as shall not involve such a danger.
(2)
Land within a proposed subdivision or development that is unsuitable for development shall be incorporated into common open space areas or into the buildable lots as excess land. Lots that do not comply with the requirements of this Development Code are prohibited.
(b)
Conservation.
(1)
Development shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained to avoid substantial probabilities of:
a.
Accelerated erosion.
b.
Pollution, contamination, or siltation of lakes, rivers streams, and other water bodies.
c.
Damage to vegetation.
d.
Injury to wildlife and fish habitats.
(2)
Development shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained to provide open space and to create a man-made environment for human use or occupancy compatible and harmonious with the natural environment and specific consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural topography, to preservation of existing vegetation, to retention of major land forms and to preservation of important vistas.
(c)
Conformance to the comprehensive plan and other adopted plans. In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivisions and individual development projects shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations:
(1)
All proposed subdivisions and individual development projects shall conform to the comprehensive plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the Planning and Community Development Department.
(2)
All highways, major thoroughfares, streets and other transportation facilities shall be platted by the developer in the location and to the dimension indicated on the comprehensive plan or the transportation plan, whichever is the most recently adopted or amended.
(3)
When features of the comprehensive plan or other plans adopted by the board of commissioners (such as schools or other public building sites, parks or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part in a subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
a.
Whenever a plat or site plan proposes the dedication of land to public use that the planning and community development director finds not required or suitable for such public use, the planning and community development director shall refuse to approve the plat or site plan. The director's opinion may be appealed to the board of commissioners.
b.
Whenever a plat or site plan proposes the dedication of land to public use that the board of commissioners finds to be not required or suitable for such public use, the board of commissioners shall refuse to accept the dedication.
(4)
In subdivisions or developments related to or affecting any state or U.S. numbered highway, the Planning and Community Development Department shall require the approval of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(5)
Any and all rules of the county health department, the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service), and all other appropriate state and federal agencies.
(d)
Name of subdivision or development project. The name of each subdivision or development project must have the approval of the Planning and Community Development Department. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision or development project in Barrow County or any of its cities.
(1)
Street names.
a.
Proposed streets obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate existing street names in Barrow County or any of its cities, irrespective of the use of a suffix such as: street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court or other derivatives. In the same development, the root name may reoccur four times.
b.
Root names shall consist of no more than 20 characters including spaces and punctuation marks.
(2)
Approval of street names for new subdivisions. All new subdivision streets must have proposed street names viewed and approved. New street names must be shown on the final plat and recorded as such. To obtain approval of a proposed street name, you must submit a list of names to the GIS department before steps are taken to receive a development permit or before using on any plats or documents. Names will be reviewed against established criteria. If acceptable, they will be placed on a "reserved list". If disapproved, you will be given an explanation of the disapproval. Street names will be verified on both preliminary and final plats to make sure that no changes have taken place. Once the final plat is recorded, street names become permanent and are so noted on all records.
(3)
Approval of subdivision names for new subdivision. As with new street names, new subdivision names must also be reviewed and approved. Names must be submitted to GIS before steps are taken to acquire a development permit or before using on any plat or document. Names will be reviewed against established criteria and if acceptable, will be placed on a "reserved list". Once the final plat is recorded, subdivision names become permanent and are so noted on all records.
(4)
Street addresses.
a.
All developments, commercial or residential, must be assigned a street address after the issuing of a septic permit and building permit. This gives confirmation that the lot is buildable.
b.
All new subdivisions are assigned addresses right before final plat approval. Environmental health signature is required on the plat before addresses are issued. Submit two copies of the plat to the GIS department for assignment of addresses.
(e)
Alleys. Alleys shall only be allowed as an intrinsic element of a particular development design, such as providing access to rear-entry garages in a subdivision, and must be approved as part of the project approval process contained in the Procedures and Permits Article of this Development Code.
(f)
Blocks.
(1)
Design guidelines. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to:
a.
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
b.
Zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
c.
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
d.
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
(2)
Length.
a.
Unless otherwise approved by the planning and community development director under unusual circumstances, block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length.
b.
In blocks greater than 1,200 feet in length, the planning and community development director may require one or more public easements of not less than 20 feet in width to extend entirely across the block for pedestrian crosswalks, fire protection or utilities.
c.
Width: Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except as follows:
1.
Where reverse frontage lots on major thoroughfares are provided, or where abutting upon limited access highways or railroads;
2.
When prevented by topographic conditions or size of the property;
3.
Lots along the periphery of the subdivision; or
4.
Other situations make this requirement impractical, in which case the planning and community development director may approve a single row of lots.
(3)
Nonresidential blocks. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for the prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking and service.
(g)
Lots. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated and meet all the area and dimensional requirements of this Development Code for the zoning district in which the lots are located.
(1)
Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a site large enough for a normal building that will meet all building setback requirements as set forth in this Development Code and not be subject to flood or periodic inundation
(2)
Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines (including culs-de-sac).
(3)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the front building setback lines on both streets.
(4)
Through (double-frontage) lots.
a.
Except where specifically required to provide reverse frontage separation from a county road or a state or U.S. numbered highway, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation of property, through lots (i.e., "double-frontage" lots) are to be avoided.
b.
A no-access easement of at least 25 feet in width, shall be provided along U.S. or state numbered highways and 10 feet in width along all other county roads. Said easement shall contain a planting screen of trees and shrubs, decorative fencing or other landscape treatment as outlined in this Development Code.
(5)
Lot depth restrictions. Lots in any minor subdivision or major subdivision that front exclusively on, or gain their access from, an existing county road shall have a lot depth no greater than five times the lot frontage. This provision does not apply to any lot that is larger than 25 acres in size.
(6)
Placement of lots. All lots of a new development shall face the interior streets of the development, except where expressly allowed by this Development Code, such as minor subdivisions.
(7)
Grading of lots.
a.
Maximum graded earthen slope shall not be steeper than 2½:1.
b.
Walls providing grade separation greater than two feet in height shall be designed by a registered design professional and subject to inspection by the building inspector.
c.
When a development incorporates step walls, then a registered design professional shall design wall system.
Table 10.1: Slope Height
EXPAND
Slope Maximum Height
2.5:1 5 feet
3:1 6 feet
4:1 No limit
  (h)
Areas reserved for future development. If any portion of a tract is reserved for future subdivision development, the minimum lot width and frontage of the reserved area may be reduced to the width required for a future street to serve such area.
(1)
Such a reserved area must be labeled "reserved for future development" on the final subdivision plat, and the portion of the lot where a street will be built must be labeled "future street".
(2)
Such a reserved area will not be eligible for issuance of a building permit unless the lot meets all requirements of this Development Code, including minimum lot width and frontage requirements of the applicable zoning district.
(i)
Plats straddling political boundaries. Whenever access to a subdivision is required across land in another governmental jurisdiction, the planning and community development director may request assurance from the county attorney, and/or the other county agency that access is legally established, and that the access road is adequately improved. In general, lot lines shall be laid out so as to not cross jurisdictional boundary lines.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1180. - Required improvements.
(a)

(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-1182. - Easements.
(a)
Utility easements.
(1)
Utility easements for private utilities shall be avoided except in cases where no other satisfactory arrangements can be provided for the installation of private utilities.
(2)
Whenever it is necessary or desirable to locate a public utility line outside of the street right-of-way, the line shall be located in an easement dedicated to the county (or other appropriate public entity) for such purpose. Easements for water and sanitary sewers shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, and may be required to be wider depending on the depth of cut to maintain a 1:1 open cut slope. When warranted, temporary construction easements widths shall be as required by the county.
(3)
Easements for sanitary sewers may be required by the director of public works for future extension of lines, whether or not the subdivision or development is currently proposed to be served by public sewer.
(b)
Pedestrian easements. Pedestrian easements, not less than ten feet wide, may be required where deemed essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities.
(c)
Drainage and access easements.
(1)
Publicly dedicated drainage easements for improved ditches, pipe construction, and detention facilities shall be cleared, opened, and stabilized at the time of development to control surface water runoff. Runoff slopes and side slopes shall be specified by the developer's engineer according to good engineering practices.
(2)
Publicly dedicated drainage easements shall be provided where a development is traversed by or contains a watercourse, impoundment, detention pond, floodplain, natural stream or channel. It shall conform substantially to the flooding limits of the 100-year storm along such natural drainage feature, but shall not be less than 20 feet in width.
(3)
A publicly dedicated drainage easement is to be provided along any manmade drainage channel or drainage pipe located outside a street right-of-way. All drainage easements shall be calculated as the pipe diameter plus two feet plus two times the depth, rounded up to the nearest five-foot interval, but shall be no less than 20 feet wide.
(4)
Drainage easements outside of the street right-of-way shall be clearly defined on the final plat with dimensions or bearings and distances as appropriate. Approval of a plat by the county shall not constitute acceptance of any easement indicated on the plat by the county; absent express acceptance by the county all easements shall be considered dedicated to the public and not accepted by the county. The property owner will be required to maintain and keep the publicly-dedicated easement free of obstruction in such a way as to assure the maximum designed flow at all times. The property owner shall not alter any drainage improvements without the prior approval from the county.
(5)
Barrow County may access and maintain, but assumes no responsibility to maintain publicly-dedicated easements, natural or artificial drains, pipes, and other structures beyond the extent of county property and county-accepted drainage easements. Barrow County assumes no responsibility for the extension of culverts beyond the point shown on the approved and recorded plan.
(d)
Conservation and natural resource easements. Conservation and natural resource easements, as may be required by this Development Code shall be clearly defined on the plat and deed of the individual property owner, and must conform to the requirements set out for such easements in the environmental protection article of this Development Code.
(e)
Overlapping easements. Easements for water, sanitary sewers and drainage purposes may be combined, but must be a minimum of 30 feet if in combination. Any easement containing more than one pipe must provide at least ten feet beyond the pipe and the pipes must be at least ten feet apart (measured on center). Wider easements shall be required when necessary to maintain a 1:1 open cut slope to each pipe.
Sec. 89-1183. - Streets.
(a)
Access.
(1)
Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or a private street approved by the county, or has access to a public street by means of a recorded access easement as provided for in this Development Code.
(2)
Every development and every major subdivision shall have access to the public street system via a paved road. A building permit shall not be issued unless a publicly dedicated street or an approved private street provides continuous paved road access between the property and the public street system. See subsection (g) below.
(3)
A building permit shall not be issued on any property that does not front on or have approved access to a publicly dedicated street or an approved private street, in accordance with the minimum lot frontage and access easement provisions of this Development Code.
(4)
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
(5)
No subdivision or development shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
(6)
Reserve strips which control access to streets, alleys and public grounds shall be prohibited unless their control is placed in the hands of the county under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the county attorney and the planning and community development director.
(7)
Subdivision streets that intersect a state or U.S. numbered highway, a county arterial or county collector road shall do so at intervals of not less than 800 feet, or as required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, whichever is greater. On all other roads, at least 300 feet must separate street intersections on the same side of the road, measured centerline to centerline. Compliance with sight distance requirements of this Development Code may require greater distances between street intersections.
(b)
Street classifications. Streets are classified according to the function that they serve, the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads are as follows, and as may be shown on the latest adopted or amended Barrow County Thoroughfares: Functional Classification System Map:
(1)
Principal arterials. These roads, which include interstates and rural freeways; serve "substantial" statewide or interstate trips, as defined by high mileage or volume; connect most urban areas of 25,000 or more and virtually all urban areas of 50,000 or more; and provide an integrated network without stub connections except where geography dictates otherwise.
(2)
Minor arterials. With the principal arterial system, these roads form a rural network that links other cities, larger towns, and other traffic generators, such as major resort areas, capable of attracting travel over long distances; links all developed areas of the state; and serve corridors with trip lengths and travel density greater than those predominantly served by rural collector or local systems. Minor arterials therefore constitute routes whose design should be expected to provide for relatively high overall travel speeds, with minimum interference to through-movement.
(3)
Major collectors. These roads, with minor collectors, primarily serve the county rather than state traffic. Consequently, more moderate speeds are typical. They serve any county seat or larger town not on an arterial route, and other traffic generators of equivalent intra county importance, such as consolidated schools, shipping points, county parks, and important mining and agricultural areas; link the latter places with nearby larger towns or cities, or arterials and freeways; and serve the more important intra county travel corridors.
(4)
Minor collectors. Serving county-wide traffic, these roads should evenly collect traffic from local roads and bring all developed areas within a reasonable distance of a collector road; provide service to the remaining smaller communities; and link the locally important traffic generators with the hinterland.
(5)
Local roads. These roads serve primarily to provide access to adjacent land and serve low-mileage trips as compared to collectors or other higher systems. Local roads constitute the rural mileage not classified as part of the principle arterial, minor arterial, or collector systems.
(c)
Extension of existing streets.
(1)
The street pattern within a development or subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of the existing street pattern or anticipated development, if any, at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. Topography, natural features such as streams and tree growth shall be considered.
(2)
Existing streets shall be connected and extended within the limits of a new development. However, streets or portions of streets adjacent to a proposed nonresidential or multi-family use, which are developed and are being used exclusively for residential access shall not be connected, extended or in any way provide access to a nonresidential or multi- family use. In addition, private drives which provide access to a nonresidential or multi-family use shall not be permitted in any residential district.
(3)
If the county determines that the roadway should be improved to a standard greater than its current use, due specifically to the traffic that will be generated by the subdivision or development project, the developer shall provide or pay the cost of the additional materials and labor due to the increased use.
(4)
All right-of way required for off-site improvements shall be acquired by the developer at no expense to Barrow County. If the developer is unable to acquire the right-of-way, the Barrow County Attorney shall initiate acquisition proceedings, at the expense of the developer, after authorization by the Barrow County Board of Commissioners.
(5)
Access to adjoining property.
a.
Where, in the opinion of the planning and community development director, it is necessary to provide for access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property and existing streets through the development.
b.
Where no street exists or where the adjoining property is in alignment with a proposed street, a temporary turnaround shall be provided at the boundary of the property.
(6)
Subdivisions shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic on local streets. However, the provision for the extension and continuation of arterial and collector streets into and from adjoining areas is required.
(7)
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning and Community Development Department shall require marginal access streets, single tier lots, or such other treatment as will provided protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the arterial street, and separation of local and through traffic.
(d)
Design standards for streets.
(1)
Arterial streets. All state or U.S. numbered highways shall meet all design requirements of and be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation. All county arterials that are not state or U.S. numbered highways shall meet all design requirements of this Development Code.
(2)
Local and collector streets. All local and collector streets shall comply with the design and construction requirements of this Development Code, except that all state or U.S. numbered highways shall meet all design requirements of and be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(3)
Minimum width of right-of-way. Minimum width of right-of-way measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown on Table 10.2. Additional right-of-way may be required to accommodate turn lanes, deceleration lanes or other road improvements.
Table 10.2: Minimum Right-of-Way Width

Local Residential Street w/swale ditches 80 feet
Local Residential Street w/curb and gutter 60 feet
Alleys 24 feet
  * Per Georgia DOT for state and U.S. numbered highways.
(4)
Additional right-of-way.
a.
Subdivisions that include an existing street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of this Development Code shall provide additional width along one or both sides of such street or road so that the minimum right-of-way required by this article is established if lots front on the existing street. Subdivisions abutting only one side of such a street or road shall provide a minimum of one-half of the right-of-way required by these regulations measured from the center of the existing right-of-way.
b.
When a future street or road, as proposed in the comprehensive plan, adjoins or traverses the subdivision or development project, the future right-of-way shall be platted as part of the subdivision or development project. No development will be allowed within the platted future right-of-way except for drives and landscaping, and the platted future right-of-way is to be treated as a lot line for the provision of all setback lines as required by this article. The developer will be contractually bound to the county to sell this strip of land to the county at a future date, for the amount stated in the tax digest. A right-of-way agreement shall be executed prior to issuance of a development permit.
(5)
Street grades.
a.
Maximum grades for proposed streets by street classification shall be as shown on Table 10.3. Design exceptions must be justified and approved by the director of public works.
b.
All streets shall have a minimum grade of 1.5 percent. Minimum grade on culs-de-sac shall be 1.5 percent.
c.
Maximum grade across a cul-de-sac turnaround shall be six percent.
d.
Grades at 12 percent shall not exceed a length of 200 feet; greater lengths are subject to approval by the public works director.

(3)
Communications. The developer, contractor(s) and the developer's professional responsible for construction will be required to attend a pre-construction conference with the county. At the pre-construction conference, the contractor will submit to the county, in writing, the date they propose to begin construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated for longer than 72 hours and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The applicable county departments may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The county will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. Requests for inspections shall be made at least 24 hours prior to when the inspection is needed.
(4)
Concealed work. The contractor shall notify the county and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as storm sewers and bedding, storm drainage structures, etc. Inspections shall be made and passed prior to continuation of further activity.
(i)
Final acceptance. The developer's professional will provide the county copies of as-built drawings. After the submittal of these items the county will schedule a final inspection. A representative of the developer's professional and the contractor will be present during this final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of storm sewers, drainage system, drainage easements, and a complete overview of the project. The developer shall be responsible for correcting any deficiencies identified in the final development inspection prior to approval.
(j)
Responsibility for work. References in this section to the various responsibilities of contractors and design professionals are to clarify the role each is expected to play in the permitting process. No such references relieve the owner from its ultimate responsibility for compliance with this section. The owner shall ensure that its contractors and design professionals comply with the requirements of this section.
