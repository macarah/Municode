Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(a)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the Clayton County Department of Transportation and Development finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(b)
Except as provided above, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Clayton County Board of Commissioners. The Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County. The Clayton County Board of Commissioners shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road of right-of-way.
(c)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
(i)
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
(ii)
Unusual circumstances would create an extreme hardship.
(d)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(e)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
(i)
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
(ii)
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
