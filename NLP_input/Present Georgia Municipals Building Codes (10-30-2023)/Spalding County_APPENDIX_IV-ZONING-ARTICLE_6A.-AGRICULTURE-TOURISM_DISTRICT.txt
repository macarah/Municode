ARTICLE 6A. - AGRICULTURE-TOURISM DISTRICT

Sec. 601A. - Purpose.
The A-T district is established to provide for the development and operation of agritourism enterprises which continue the commercial, agricultural heritage of local farms, maintain the rural character of unincorporated Spalding County, preserve and expand economic opportunities for existing farms in Spalding County and protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens through education and experience with Spalding County farms. Agritourism land uses combine agriculture and tourism to provide educational and social benefits to Spalding County residents and visitors and additional economic opportunities to owners and operators of farms. Agritourism enhances tourism in Spalding County by increasing the number of visitors and the length of their stay. Agritourism will increase the economic viability of farms in Spalding County, increase farm employment in Spalding County, generate additional income for owners and operators of farms in Spalding County, and allow local citizens and visitors to interact with and learn about the importance of farming in Spalding County.
