Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 6-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed; provided, however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition; otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods, through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
