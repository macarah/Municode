Section 7.01. - Statement of purpose.
The single-family residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family dwellings. For the single-family residential district, in promoting the general purpose of this ordinance, the specific intent of this ordinance is:
a.
To encourage the construction of, and the continued use of the land for single-family dwellings.
b.
To prohibit business, commercial or industrial use of the land, and to prohibit any other use which would substantially interfere with development or maintenance of single-family dwellings in the district.
c.
To encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be permitted as new uses under the provisions of this ordinance.
d.
To discourage any land use which would generate traffic on minor or local streets/roads, other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets/roads.
e.
To discourage any use which, because of its character or size would create requirements and costs for public services such as fire and police protection, water supply and sewage disposal, substantially in excess of such requirements and costs if the district were developed solely for single-family dwellings.
