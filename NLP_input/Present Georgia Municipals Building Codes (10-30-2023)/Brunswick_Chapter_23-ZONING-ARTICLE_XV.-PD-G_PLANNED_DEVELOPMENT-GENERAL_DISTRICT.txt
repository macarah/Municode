ARTICLE XV. - PD-G PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-GENERAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-15-1. - Intent of planned development-general district.
It is the intent of this district that the PD-G zoning district be reserved for the establishment and continuance of shopping centers, group housing projects, planned industrial developments, medical centers, urban renewal projects and similar types of large-scale compatible-use developments. Also encouraged are uses or groups of uses considered by the commission to be logical and worthy, in the public interest, of inclusion in a PD-G district, and further, to encourage the development of such uses or groups of uses according to the requirements and standards of this article. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation of such planned developments when and as appropriate and to permit the greatest latitude possible with respect to internal site planning considerations and the location of these developments within the City of Brunswick in the best interests of the long-range development plans of the city.

Sec. 23-15-4. - Permitted uses.

(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008)
Sec. 23-15-5. - General design criteria and development standards.
(a)
Overall site design should be harmonious, in terms of landscaping, enclosure of principal and accessory uses, size, street patterns and use relationships. Variety in building types, heights, facades, setbacks and size of open spaces shall be encouraged.
(b)
Densities per acre for residential dwelling units shall not exceed those set forth for GR districts.
(c)
Yard and other dimensional requirements for each PD-G district may be set by the city commission, upon recommendation of the planning, development and codes department staff and the planning and appeals commission. The following criteria shall serve as a general guide for requirements set for uses proposed for location in a PD-G district:
(1)
GR district standards shall serve as minimum requirements for residential uses.
(2)
The most restrictive standards specified elsewhere in this chapter as they apply to commercial, industrial and institutional uses shall serve as minimum requirements for such uses located in PD-G districts.
(d)
Parking, loading and other requirements for each PD-G district may be set by the city commission. The standards of article III, sections 23-3-19 and 23-3-20, shall serve as a general guide to parking and loading requirements for uses proposed for location in a PD-G district.
(e)
Where development abuts a separate single-family district, buildings and activities, other than one- or two-family dwellings, must be set back a sufficient distance from the separating property line or district boundary line, not less than 30 feet for multi-family residential, public or institutional uses or 50 feet for all commercial or industrial uses to insure the absence of any objectionable effects on or from abutting districts.
(f)
In the case of commercial and industrial uses, the distances separating all buildings and activities from surrounding residential districts should in fact be great enough to constitute a reasonable buffer. Loading docks and truck maneuvering areas and terminals, where possible, should be further removed from residential lot lines than buildings.
(g)
Property lines abutting residential districts must be screened by a buffer except in the following instances:
(1)
Where one- and two-family dwellings within the PD-G district are on property immediately adjoining a residential district, then no buffer shall be required.
(2)
Where multi-family dwellings and townhouses within the PD-G district are on property immediately adjoining multi-family dwellings or townhouses in a residential district, then no buffer shall be required.
(3)
In addition, all storage yards or outdoor display spaces must be enclosed by a buffer strip except for access points.
(h)
Within a PD-G district, the design should include buffers suitable for screening residential areas from institutional, commercial or industrial uses when a danger of incompatibility appears to exist.
(i)
Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect the highways and neighboring properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind.
(j)
Sign requirements may be set by the city commission, following recommendation by the planning, development and codes department staff and the planning appeals commission.
(k)
In PD-G districts, areas used for parking or loading or as traffic ways, shall be physically separated from public streets by suitable barriers against unchanneled motor vehicle ingress or egress. Access points shall generally conform to standards set forth in section 23-3-22, with the following exceptions:
(l)
Shopping centers, other individual commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family uses shall have not more than two access points to any one public street, unless unusual circumstances demonstrate the need for additional access points.
(m)
Where possible, all access points to a public street from shopping centers, other individual commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family uses shall be located at least 100 feet from the intersection of any street lines and shall be designed in a manner conducive to safe ingress and egress.
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008; Ord. No. 1055, § 2, 3-21-2018)
Sec. 23-15-6. - Special requirements for districts.
In addition to the general criteria set forth elsewhere in this article, projects submitted as proposed PD-G districts shall meet whatever standards are deemed suitable to the particular request by the commission, upon recommendation by the planning staff. The maximum height of all buildings in PD-G shall be 60 feet.
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008)
