ARTICLE V. - SPECIAL EVENTS

Words and terms used in this article are defined as follows:
Permit: A permit as required by this article.
Private Function: A gathering of individuals that is not advertised; is by invitation-only; and is without charge for admission to which the general public is neither invited nor allowed to attend. The guests and attendants are served in an area designated and used exclusively for the private function or event. The private function is normally booked, or set, in advance by a single contact person with the number of guests appropriate for the area. It is normally composed of a cohesive group whose members are individually invited by the host of the private function. If alcohol is involved, only those invited members may consume alcohol and they are not charged for the cost of the alcohol. The exception is when a cohesive group pools money to fund the private function, as opposed to a cover charge or entrance fee. A cover charge or entrance fee precludes a function from meeting the definition of a private party. Examples of qualifying groups as "private functions" include, but are not limited to, wedding receptions, family parties, corporate and company functions. It does not include an open invitation by a licensed establishment or business to the general public for a gathering at which the individual invitees are expected to pay for their food and beverages or for their admission to the function.
