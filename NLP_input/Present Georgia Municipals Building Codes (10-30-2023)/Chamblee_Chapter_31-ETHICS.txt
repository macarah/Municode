Any non-written information which, if it were written, could be excepted from disclosure under state law, unless the public servant disclosing it is authorized to do so by the state law, or pursuant to some other pertinent law, policy or procedure; and

Information which was obtained in the course of or by means of a record or oral report of a lawful executive or closed session, whether or not the disclosure of the information would violate state law, unless the public servant disclosing it is authorized by state law to do so, or unless the public servant disclosing it has been properly authorized to disclose it pursuant to an applicable law, policy or procedure; however, when such information is also available through channels which are open to the public, this provision does not prohibit public servants from disclosing the availability of those channels.
Decision maker means any public servant or group of public servants empowered to act in a discretionary manner on behalf of the city in any capacity whatsoever, including the making of recommendations. The term "decision maker" includes, but is not limited to, any city agency, bureau, department, division, office, administrator or person who is charged with implementing and administering particular legislation or executive or administrative decisions, and, to the extent this article is applicable to them, any volunteer or independent contractor who is empowered to exercise any discretionary power which could influence a public servant in the performance or nonperformance of an official action. In this article, the term "decision maker" is used to represent any and every public servant who could take any discretionary action regarding a matter in which a public servant or a partner in interest has or may have a conflict of interest, or as a result of which a public servant might receive a personal benefit.

Unless this article or a law which supersedes it requires or permits another procedure, information shall be deemed disclosed if any public servant, within a reasonable time before any official action is to be taken by the decision maker, provides the city clerk with written notice disclosing the conflict or potential conflict. For purposes of this provision, the phrase "within a reasonable time" means within adequate time to allow the city clerk to forward the disclosure to the decision maker before whom the matter is pending or may be brought, and within adequate time to allow the decision maker to review the disclosure before taking any official action.

(Ord. No. 660, pt. I, 11-19-13)
Sec. 31-22. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
The city government is a representative democracy. Those who are elected, appointed, hired, volunteer or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. Public trust requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair.
(b)
It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government.
(c)
In adopting this article, the city recognizes that:
(1)
Public servants are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community;
(2)
Public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights;
(3)
It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material and avoidable;
(4)
Public servants are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments.
(d)
This article provides the minimum standards which a public servant's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this article is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm. A work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who:
(1)
Recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public;
(2)
Are motivated and committed to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards;
(3)
Encourage ethical practices which protect, advance and promote the public interest;
(4)
Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves, and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of others;
(5)
When they observe serious unethical practices, promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities, and encourage others to do the same;
(6)
Ensure that those for whom they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and
(7)
When circumstances warrant, appropriately discipline those who are proven to have engaged in unethical behavior.
(Ord. No. 660, pt. I, 11-19-13)
Sec. 31-23. - Purposes of article.

Adequately educate public servants, and any subordinates, in the principles of ethics;
(3)
Encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve;
(4)
Provide a process by which public servants may identify and resolve ethical issues;
(5)
Provide a process to ensure the prompt disclosure by public servants of serious unethical practices, and encourage others to do the same;
(6)
Provide a fair and impartial process by which alleged violations of this article may be heard;
(7)
Provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this article; and
(8)
Establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust.

If a matter comes before the city council in which a public servant or a member of the family of the public servant does not have a financial interest, direct contractual interest or employment interest such as provided by the section pertaining to abstention, but in which the public servant in good faith determines that his or her professional representative/client has such an interest and which the public servant in good faith believes could create an impression of partiality, such professional relationship should be disclosed by the public servant prior to the public servant's participating in any discussion or official action with respect to the matter. Such relationship shall not preclude participation and voting on a subject.

Nothing herein shall require the public servant to absent himself or herself from her seat while action is taken for any item for which the public servant has a conflict of interest which is contained on a "consent agenda" and upon which there is no deliberation provided the public servant's conflict has been disclosed and the public servant abstains from voting on that particular item on the "consent agenda" and while voting for the "consent agenda", except as noted (Note: The public servant may vote for the adoption of the "consent agenda" provided it shows that he or she abstained from that particular item on the consent agenda).
(f)

(4)
The burden shall be on the complainant to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the accused public servant has violated the provisions of this article.
(c)
Within ten days of the hearing, the ethics board shall meet to determine whether the complainant has proven, by clear and convincing evidence that the accused public servant has violated the provisions of this article.

If the board determines by majority vote that the burden has not been met, the board shall dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
(d)
If the board determines, by majority vote, that the accused public servant violated the provisions of this article, the board shall recommend punishment for said violation to the mayor and city council by stating so on the record, which shall be transmitted to the mayor and city council within five days of the conclusion of the board's determination.
(e)
The report of the board, as well as all documentation gathered by the hearing officer as part of each complaint and as presented in any evidentiary hearing, shall be subject to the requirements of the Georgia Open Records Act and all meetings of the board, including the evidentiary hearing where the board serves as "jury," shall be subject to the requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act.
