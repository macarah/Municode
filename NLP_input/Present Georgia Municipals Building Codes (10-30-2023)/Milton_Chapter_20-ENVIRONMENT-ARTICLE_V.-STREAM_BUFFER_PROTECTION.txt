(Ord. No. 06-12-72, § 1(ch. 14, art. 6, § 2), 12-7-2006; Ord. No. 08-11-29, § 1(ch. 14, art. 6, § 2), 11-17-2008; Ord. No. 09-01-35, § 1(ch. 14, art. 6, § 2), 1-21-2009; Ord. No. 21-11-491 , § 1(Exh. A), 2021)
Sec. 20-383. - Applicability.
modified
(a)
Generally. This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a state water protection area as defined in section 20-381. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. When applying the provisions of this chapter to buffer and setback requirements in protected small water supply watersheds, the effective date for these requirements shall be December 20, 2021.
(1)
Grandfather provisions. Except as provided in subsection (c) below, this article shall not apply to the following activities:
a.
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before December 7, 2006.
b.
Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements, and a predetermination of continuing applicability by the community development director, or designee, as required in subsection (d) below.
c.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of December 7, 2006.
d.
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved as of December 7, 2006.
(2)
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
a.
Activities for the purpose of building one of the following:
1.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line;
2.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
3.
Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property;

(iv)
Fishing platforms; and
(v)
Overlooks;
5.
Unpaved foot trails and paths; and
6.
Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used.
b.
Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (a)(2)a of this section.
c.
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or approved under the terms of this article.
d.
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility including, but not limited to:
1.
Manholes;
2.
Vents; and
3.
Valve structures.
e.
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
f.
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
g.
After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
(b)
Prohibited; exception. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 20-427.
(c)
Best management practices. Any land disturbance or land development activity that may be allowed or permitted within a grandfathered area as described in subsection (a)(1) above must be conducted in accordance with the following best management practices:
(1)
Appropriate allowances must be made for any disturbance or development (e.g., structures, pools, walls, foundations) that encroaches into the 75-foot impervious setback or the 50-foot undisturbed city stream buffer.
(2)
All paved surfaces within the 75-foot impervious setback or the 50-foot undisturbed city stream buffer shall be constructed of pervious materials.
(3)
An approved sediment control barrier shall be installed as far as possible from the 25-foot undisturbed State buffer prior to beginning any construction.
(4)

(d)
Predetermination requirement. The applicability of any exemption available hereunder to any requirement of this article, including those exemptions listed in subsection (a)(2) above, shall be subject to the predetermination of the community development director, or designee, prior to commencing the proposed activity. The city shall adopt an administrative process for private property owners to request and receive a determination by the community development director, or designee, regarding the applicability of any exemption that may be available to limit in any way the requirements of this article. Such determination shall be provided to the property owner requesting it at no cost to the property owner. In the event a private property owner does not avail themselves of the administrative process identified in this paragraph and takes independent action as if they were exempted from some or all of the requirements of this article without a predetermination having been made, the property owner shall be deemed to have forfeited their right to pursue such an available administrative remedy and the city shall have all enforcement options available under law, including but not limited to, a five-year hold on an approval of any building permit or land disturbance permit for the subject property. In addition, if some or all the requirements related to the exclusion(s) of this article are not implemented, the city shall have all enforcement options available under law, including but not limited to, a five-year hold on an approval of any building permit or land disturbance permit for the subject property.

Sec. 20-427. - Variance procedures.
Variances from the buffer and setback requirements stated in section 20-426 may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the mayor and city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder; provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. Once established by the mayor and city council, the board of zoning appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder; provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, and until such time as the mayor and city council establishes the board of zoning appeals, the mayor and city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and city council.
a.
Once established by the mayor and city council, the board of zoning appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the board of zoning appeals.
b.
The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city.
c.
The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
d.
When a variance request is concurrent with a rezoning use permit or a modification application, it shall be considered by the mayor and city council and shall follow the process contained in section 64-1890, concurrent variances of the city zoning ordinance (chapter 64).
e.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
1.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
2.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements of this article would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes the locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable;
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
(5)
Any variance approved shall be site-plan specific.

Sec. 20-448. - Additional standards enforced by the city.
(a)
Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan.
(1)
The Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan require the following on perennial tributary streams in a corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments (all measured from the edge of the water):
a.
A 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer;
b.
A 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee and its impoundments; and
c.
A 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer.
(2)
The corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton counties).
(3)
Streams in the basin of the corridor are required to be protected by buffers, but no required width is specified (O.C.G.A. § 2-5-440 et seq.).
(b)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for Small (under 100 square miles) Water Supply Watersheds Authorized under Part V of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989. These criteria require the following:
(1)
A 100-foot undisturbed buffer and a 150-foot setback on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake.
(2)
Beyond seven miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet.
Equivalent protection measures can be adopted with approval from Georgia DCA and DNR.
(c)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for River Protection Authorized under the 1991 Mountains and River Corridors Protection Act of 1991. These criteria require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cubic feet per second (cfs), excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced in subsection (a) of this section. The buffer is measured from the top of the stream bank.
(d)
Other such state and federal regulations as may be adopted from time to time.
(1)
While the requirements of this article are intended to apply to all streams in the city, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation.
