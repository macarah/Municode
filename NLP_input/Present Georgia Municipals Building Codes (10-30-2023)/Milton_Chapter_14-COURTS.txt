Filing and presentation to the judge shall be not later than five days after the affiant first learned of the alleged grounds for disqualification, and not later than ten days prior to the hearing or trial which is the subject of the recusal or disqualification, unless good cause is shown for the failure to meet such time requirements. In no event shall the motion be allowed to delay the trial or proceeding.
(b)
Affidavit; contents. The affidavit shall clearly state the facts and reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, being definite and specific as to time, place, persons and circumstances of extrajudicial conduct or statements, which demonstrate either bias in favor of any adverse party, or prejudice toward the moving party in particular, or a systematic pattern of prejudicial conduct toward the persons similarly situated to the moving party, which would influence the judge and impede or prevent impartiality in that action. Allegations consisting of bare conclusions and opinions shall not be legally sufficient to support the motion or warrant further proceedings.
(c)
Procedure upon a motion for disqualification. Any motion for disqualification of the presiding judge shall be assigned for hearing to another judge.

(Ord. No. 07-04-20, § 1(11), 4-12-2007)
Sec. 14-109. - Pleading by defendant.
(a)
Alternatives.
(1)
A defendant may plead guilty, not guilty or, in the discretion of the judge, nolo contendere. A plea of guilty or nolo contendere should be received only from the defendant personally in open court. The only exception will be at the judge's discretion to accept a plea from the attorney of record in absentia.
(2)
A defendant may plead nolo contendere only with the consent of the judge. Such a plea should be accepted by the judge only after due consideration of the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice. Procedurally, a plea of nolo contendere should be handled under these rules in a manner similar to a plea of guilty.
(b)
Aid and time considerations.
(1)
Aid to counsel. A defendant shall not be called upon to plead before having an opportunity to retain counsel. A defendant with counsel shall not be required to enter a plea if counsel makes a reasonable request for additional time to represent the defendant's interest, or if the defendant has not had a reasonable time to consult with counsel.
(2)
Time for deliberation. A defendant without counsel should not be called upon to plead to any offense without having had a reasonable time to consider this decision. When a defendant without counsel tenders a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to an offense, the court should not accept the plea unless it is reaffirmed by the defendant after a reasonable time for deliberation, following the advice from the court required in subsection (h) of this section.
(c)
Plea discussions and agreements. In cases in which it appears that the public's interests in the effective administration of criminal justice would thereby be served, the solicitor may engage in plea discussions for the purpose of reaching a plea agreement. The solicitor should engage in plea discussions or reach a plea agreement with the defendant only through defense counsel, except when the defendant does not desire and has not retained counsel. The solicitor, in reaching a plea agreement, may agree to one or more of the following, as dictated by circumstances of the individual case:
(1)
To make or not to oppose favorable recommendations as to the sentence which should be imposed if the defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;
(2)
To seek or not to oppose dismissal of the offense charged if the defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to another offense reasonably related to the defendant's conduct; or
(3)
To seek or not to oppose dismissal of other charges or potential charges against the defendant if the defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.
(d)
Relationship between defense counsel and client.
(1)
Defense counsel should conclude a plea agreement only with the consent of the defendant, and should ensure that the decision to enter or not enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is ultimately made by the defendant.
(2)
To aid the defendant in reaching a decision, defense counsel, after appropriate investigation, should advise the defendant of the alternatives available and of considerations deemed important by him or her in reaching a decision.
(e)
Responsibilities of the judge.
(1)
The judge should not participate in plea discussions.
a.
If a tentative agreement has been reached, upon request of the parties, the judge may permit the parties to disclose the tentative agreement and the reasons therefore in advance of the time for the tendering of the plea.
b.
The judge may then indicate to the solicitor and defense counsel whether the judge will likely concur in the proposed disposition if the information developed in the plea hearing or presented in the presentence report is consistent with the representations made by the parties.
c.
If the judge concurs but the final disposition differs from that contemplated by the plea agreement, then the judge shall state for the record what information in the presentence report or hearing contributed to the decision not to sentence in accordance with the plea agreement.
(2)
When a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered or received as a result of a plea agreement, the judge should give the agreement due consideration but, notwithstanding its existence, must reach an independent decision on whether to grant charge or sentence leniency under the principles set forth in subsection (f) of this section.
(f)
Consideration of plea in final disposition. It is proper for the judge to grant charge and sentence leniency to defendants who enter pleas of guilty or nolo contendere where the public's interests in the effective administration of criminal justice are thereby served. Among the considerations which are appropriate in determining this question are:
(1)
That the defendant by entering a plea has aided in ensuring the prompt and certain application of correctional measures;
(2)
That the defendant has acknowledged guilt and shown a willingness to assume responsibility for conduct;
(3)
That the leniency will make possible alternative correctional measures which are better adapted to achieving rehabilitative, protective, deterrent or other purposes of correctional treatment, or will prevent undue harm to the defendant from the form of conviction;
(4)
That the defendant has made public trial unnecessary when there are good reasons for not having the case dealt with in a public trial;
(5)
That the defendant has given or offered cooperation when such cooperation has resulted or may result in the successful prosecution of other offenders engaged in equally serious or more serious criminal conduct; and
(6)
That the defendant by entering a plea has aided in avoiding delay (including delay due to crowded dockets) in the disposition of other cases and thereby has increased the probability of prompt and certain application of correctional measures to other offenders.
The judge should not impose upon a defendant any sentence in excess of that which would be justified by any of the rehabilitative, protective, deterrent or other purposes of criminal law merely because the defendant has chosen to require the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt at trial rather than to enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.
(g)
Determining voluntariness of plea; procedure. The judge shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first determining, on the record, that the plea is voluntary.
(1)
By inquiry of the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, the judge should determine whether the tendered plea is the result of prior plea discussions and a plea agreement, and if it is, what agreement has been reached.
(2)
If the prosecuting attorney has agreed to seek charge or sentence leniency which must be approved by the judge, the judge must advise the defendant personally that the recommendations of the prosecuting attorney are not binding on the judge.
(3)
The judge should then address the defendant personally and determine whether any other promises or any force or threats were used to obtain the plea.
(h)
Informing defendant. The judge should not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from a defendant without first:
(1)
Determining on the record that the defendant understands the nature of the charge;
(2)
Informing the defendant on the record that by entering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere one waives:
a.
The right to trial by jury;
b.
The presumption of innocence;
c.
The right to confront witnesses against oneself;
d.
The right to subpoena witnesses;
e.
The right to testify and to offer other evidence;
f.
The right to assistance of counsel during trial; and
g.
The right not to incriminate oneself.
(3)
Informing the defendant on the record:
a.
Of the terms of any negotiated plea;
b.
The maximum possible sentence on the charge, including that possible from consecutive sentences;
c.
Of the mandatory minimum sentence, if any, on the charge. This information may be developed by questions from the judge, the solicitor or the defense attorney, or a combination of any of these.
(i)
Determining accuracy of plea. Notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, judgment should not be entered upon such plea without such inquiry on the record as may satisfy the judge that there is a factual basis for the plea.
(j)
Stating intention to reject the plea agreement. If the court intends to reject the plea agreement, the judge shall, on the record, inform the defendant personally that:
(1)
The court is not bound by any plea agreement;
(2)
The court intends to reject the plea agreement presently before it;
(3)
The disposition of the present case may be less favorable to the defendant than that contemplated by the plea agreement; and
(4)
The defendant may then withdraw his or her guilty plea as a matter of right. If the plea is not then withdrawn, sentence may be pronounced.
(k)
Record of proceedings. A verbatim record of the proceedings at which a defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be made and preserved. The record should include:
(1)
The inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea (as required in subsection (g) of this section);
(2)
The advice to the defendant (as required in subsection (h) of this section);
(3)
The inquiry into the accuracy of the plea (as required in subsection (i) of this section); and, if applicable
(4)
The notice to the defendant that the court intends to reject the plea agreement and the defendant's right to withdraw the guilty plea before sentence is pronounced.
(l)
Plea withdrawal. After sentence is pronounced, the judge should allow the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere whenever the defendant, upon a timely motion for withdrawal, proves that a withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice. In the absence of a showing that withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, a defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere as a matter of right once sentence has been pronounced by the judge.

ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF CONDUCT FOR NONJUDICIAL EMPLOYEES

Sec. 14-133. - Upholding integrity and independence of court standards.
(a)
The holding of public employment in the court system is a public trust justified by the confidence that the citizenry reposes in the integrity of officers and employees of the judicial branch. A court employee, faithful to that trust, therefore shall observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the courts may be preserved.
(b)
Court employees shall carry out all duties assigned by law and shall put loyalty to the principles embodied in this code above loyalty to persons or parties.

Sec. 14-137. - Conflicts of interest.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Conflict of interest.
(1)
The term "conflict of interest" means a situation exists where the court employee's objective ability or independence of judgment in the performance of his or her job is impaired or may reasonably appear to be impaired or when the court employee, or the employee's immediate family or business, would derive financial gain as a result of the employee's position within the court system.
(2)
The term "conflict of interest" does not include a situation where any benefit or detriment accrues to the employee as a member of a profession, business or group to the same extent as any other member of the profession, business or group who does not hold a position within the court system.
Immediate family includes the following, whether related by marriage, blood or adoption:
(1)
Spouse;
(2)
Dependent children;
(3)
Brother and sister;

(7)
Half-brother or half-sister.
(b)
Prohibited. Every court employee shall avoid conflicts of interest in the performance of professional duties. Even though no misuse of office is involved, such a conflict of interest involving a court employee can seriously undermine the community's confidence and trust in the court system. Therefore, every court employee is required to exercise diligence in becoming aware of conflicts of interest, disclosing conflicts to the designated authority and ending them when they arise.
(c)
Prohibited activities.
(1)
No court employee shall enter into any contract with the court system for services, supplies, equipment, leases or realty, apart from the employment contract relating to the employee's position, nor use that position to assist any member of his or her immediate family in securing a contract with the court system in a manner not available to any other interested party.

(6)
No court employee shall solicit, accept or agree to accept any gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality or services under circumstances from which it could reasonably be inferred that a major purpose of the donor is to influence the court employee in the performance of official duties.

a.
Prohibit an employee from accepting a public award presented in recognition of public service.

Gifts received with the understanding that they will influence employees' official actions, decisions or judgments are prohibited as abuse of office in section 14-135(b).
d.
Prohibit any person or group from donating a gift of historical or other significant value that is given for the benefit of the court system, provided that such a gift is received on behalf of the court system by the appropriate designated authority.

(2)
The outside employment is capable of being fulfilled outside of normal working hours and is not incompatible with the performance of the court employee's duties and responsibilities;
(3)
The outside employment does not require the practice of law;
(4)
The outside employment does not require or induce the court employee to disclose confidential information acquired in the course of and by reason of official duties;
(5)
The outside employment shall not be within the judicial, executive or legislative branch of government without written consent of both employers; and
