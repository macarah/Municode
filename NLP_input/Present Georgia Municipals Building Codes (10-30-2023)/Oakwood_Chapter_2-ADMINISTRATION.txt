(a)
Adoption; purpose. Pursuant to the authority granted to it by the laws of the state and the city Charter, the city council hereby ordains that the following policy is adopted to compensate and reimburse city elected officials who will be traveling for approved city business. Elected officials are encouraged to take advantage of training opportunities and represent the city at various meetings and events. This travel policy is hereby established to facilitate reimbursement for expenses incurred. Elected officials are responsible to know what the city's travel policy states and to abide by this policy. Elected officials shall only be reimbursed for expenses actually and necessarily incurred by the elected official in carrying out their official duties. No reimbursement shall ever exceed the actual expenditure incurred by the elected official.
(b)
Meetings; events; out-of-state travel. Any elected official's attendance or travel to training, meetings, or events held out of state that is not related to the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA) or National League of Cities (NLC) must be pre-approved by the city council.
(c)
Spouse/dependent attendance. Within budget, the city encourages elected officials to attend functions that will be in the best interest of the city. Spousal attendance frequently enhances the image of the city and is usually encouraged. However, the city cannot expend public funds for spouses while elected officials are attending meetings, conferences, training sessions, conventions or other city-sponsored functions. Therefore, spousal attendance/participation is a personal expense.
(d)
Expenses.
(1)
Accommodations.
a.
Outside a 50-mile radius. The city will pay for overnight lodging expenses outside the 50-mile radius of the city for training. Accommodations should be in or as close to the conference center as possible.
1.
Room receipts are required. Amounts are expected to be reasonable and within the range of similar quarters in the immediate area visited, not to exceed an amount equal to established convention rates at the convention/meeting headquarters hotel. If accommodations are not available at the headquarters hotel, the city will pay the prevailing rate at alternate hotels recommended by the convention officials, not to exceed the rate of the headquarters hotel.
2.
The city is exempted from all taxes when its officials stay in a hotel in the state. A hotel/motel tax exemption form and a state tax exemption form will be provided for the elected official to present upon arriving at the hotel.
3.
Officials must pick up a city check or city credit card before leaving for the trip and present at check-in for each overnight in-state trip, (required) to receive tax exemptions. It is the responsibility of the elected official to ensure that all tax exemptions are secured; the city will not reimburse for tax that should have been exempted.
b.
Within a 50-mile radius. The city will not pay/reimburse for overnight lodging expenses within a 50-mile radius of the city, unless pre-approved by council for circumstances where an elected official may have early morning or late night meetings.
1.
The approval should be confirmed in advance of registration to stay at a convention hotel within the 50-mile radius.
2.
The city will cover overnight lodging expenses within a 50-mile radius when a city strategic planning conference is held and the city will pay directly to the facility. Mileage expenses may be reimbursed for strategic conferences, using city hall as the beginning point, since reimbursement policies normally do not cover mileage getting to the place of work.
(2)
Food. Travelers are expected to take advantage of all meals included in convention/meeting registration fees. Expenses for other meals shall be paid based on a reasonable food cost in the area being visited.
a.
The city will not pay for alcoholic beverages. Spouses or guest's meals (including tax and gratuities) and/or any alcoholic beverages must be deducted from receipts; only travelers' expenses may be included on the reimbursement request.
b.

(3)
Transportation. Travel reimbursements will cover either commercial tickets (usually airline) or mileage for use of a personal vehicle at the rate as allowed by the IRS and approved by the city council. Reimbursements will not be made for first-class commercial airline tickets. The city will reimburse for the most cost-effective mode of travel.
a.
Reasonable taxi fares and parking fees are covered when necessary.
b.
All personal vehicle mileage must be substantiated with a detailed listing including beginning and ending odometer reading, total miles driven and the purpose of the meeting/trip. Expense reports without this documentation will be returned to the requestor (without payment) for explanation.
(e)
Reimbursements. Proper documentation is always needed for expenses to be paid by the city. The main items for proper documentation consist of receipts, meeting agenda, outline of meals by day and by meal, and detailed explanation of any item reported that is not ordinary in nature. Transactions and payments with respect to lodging, travel, and the credit card are managed and approved by the city clerk's office.
(1)
When all proper documentation is attached to the travel voucher, it should be turned in to the city clerk, who will review the voucher and the appropriate backup for any irregularities. The clerk will then obtain one other approval from another elected official and submit to the accounting department for payment. If an irregularity exists, the city clerk will address the issue immediately. If extenuating circumstances occur, then each situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
(2)
To support claims for travel and extra expenses following out-of-town events, an expense report must be submitted (see attachment 1, which is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk) and receipts must be turned in for reimbursement within three business days after returning from a trip. Elected officials may only be reimbursed for expenses actually and necessarily incurred in carrying out their official duties. Other necessary or unusual expenses incurred will be paid after written explanation is attached to travel voucher and approved by all appropriate personnel.
(3)
Telephone charges are allowed so the employee can call home. The employee is allowed one phone call home each day with the charges not to exceed $8.00 per day. Local phone charges (usually $0.75) are allowed unless they become excessive.
(4)
Reimbursements will be made on a priority basis. The business office will return checks to the travelers within five working days.
