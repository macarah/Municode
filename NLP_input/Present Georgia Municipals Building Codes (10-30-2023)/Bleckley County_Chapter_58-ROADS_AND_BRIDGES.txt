Sec. 58-82. - Street and road names; numbering.
All streets, roads, or accesses to structures within the county, incorporated as well as unincorporated areas, whether maintained by the county or not, shall, at the sole discretion of the sole commissioner, be named and numbered as they are now, or in the future may be designated on the official map and index of the sole commissioner. Any street, road, or access not designated on the official index shall hereafter be referred to as designated on a said index for structure numbering purposes.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 2)

(a)
Structure numbers for dwelling units, places of business, industrial locations, and all other structures and uses requiring same shall be assigned by the 911 mapping department during and following the implementation stage of the system in each area of the county.
(b)
The 911 mapping department shall keep a record of all address numbers and road names assigned under this article. Such records may be maintained in data storage systems if so desired.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 3)
Sec. 58-84. - Posting of designated structure numbers.
(a)
The owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which has been assigned shall be notified in writing by the 911 mapping department of the number assigned to same at any time after the adoption date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(b)
Within 60 days after receipt of such written notification, the owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall cause the same to be posted and subsequently maintained in either one or two locations, depending on the conditions:
(1)
If the mailbox is located on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number may be affixed to the mailbox in letters four inches in height or larger and of a color specified by the 911 center. This subsection does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of the structure if so desired.
(2)
If the mailbox is not on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be posted at two locations:
a.
The mailbox as prescribed by U.S. postal regulations; and
b.
On an aboveground sign attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut. If attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut, said post or object shall measure two to three feet in height. The numbers shall be five inches in height or higher and of a white reflective color contrasting with the color of the background, which shall be dark green. This subsection does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance if so desired.
(c)
If a building is served by two or more driveways or curb cuts, the number shall be assigned and posted at the location determined to be most favorable by the 911 mapping department for emergency response purposes.
(d)
It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant, or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use, upon affixing the new number, to remove any different number which might be mistaken for or be confused with the number assigned to the structure by the 911 mapping department.
(e)
If the assigned number cannot be posted as required by this section, the number shall be posted as prescribed by the 911 mapping department after consultation with the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 4)
Sec. 58-85. - Types of numbers.
Two types of numbers are used in this article:
(1)
A primary address number to be assigned to each street or road frontage of each parcel of land, whether or not the parcel is occupied. The primary number is required to be posted only if the parcel is occupied by a dwelling unit, structure or use and the owner, occupant or person in charge is notified under section 58-84(a). Other primary numbers are reserved for future development of the numbered parcels and will be assigned at the time of the development.
(2)
Secondary numbers may be used when the number of units, structures, or uses coexists on the same parcel of land. Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit developments and other uses where the use of secondary numbers is necessary to clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the 911 mapping department shall work with the owner, manager, or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines:
a.
Existing numbered units and uses may retain the present set of addresses, with the approval of the 911 mapping department, with only the primary numbers complying with this article.
b.
Buildings on a single parcel with more than one and less than five units shall be given either letters (preferred) or number designations as requested by the owner.
c.
A single building on a single parcel of land and with five or more units shall be given numerical designations such as Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc., if so desired.
d.
Multiple structures on the same parcel of land may be given secondary number designations if the buildings are accessed from the main entrance to the project. Generally the number designations should increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 5)
Sec. 58-86. - Implementation in stages.
Because of the large and complex nature of the county and the existing numbering system now in place on some portions of the county, this article shall be implemented in stages covering small sections of the entire area without the need for the adoption of supplementary implementation resolutions for each section of the county.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 6)

Agricultural buildings not requiring a separate mailing address such as a barn, poultry house, outbuilding or equipment storage building as long as no phone service exists in said structure. Buildings used as a dwelling unit, office or the nominal workstation of an employee shall not be exempt.
(2)
Storage and accessory buildings for the use of the occupant of another building on the property. Building used as dwelling units, offices, or the nominal workstation of an employee, or requiring a separate mailing address, shall not be exempt.

Final approval for a certificate of occupancy of any principal building erected or repaired, or use requiring said number, shall be withheld until permanent and proper numbers have been displayed in accordance with the standards of this article.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 8)
Sec. 58-89. - Utility company compliance.
(a)
Following the implementation of this article in any area of the county, all utility services regulated by the state public service commission or any utility cooperation service organization, shall withhold service from any building until the owner or requesting party has furnished the utility with a valid structure number.
(b)
It shall be the responsibility of the structure owner, or its occupant, to notify each affected utility service of implementation in each area by producing signed compliance forms of official numbers, provided by 911 mapping department, assigned to each affected structure or use.
(c)
All utility services are required to cooperate with the county 911 mapping department by providing a complete list of all customer information requested by the 911 mapping department to facilitate implementation of this article. This shall include all pertinent information such as, but not limited to, customer names, phone number, mailing address, physical address, utility meter number or other identifying number of information. Said information shall be provided in an electronic format compatible with software used by the 911 mapping department.
(Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 9)
Sec. 58-90. - Implementation for rendering nonemergency service.
Every department and official under the jurisdiction of the sole commissioner shall not render any nonemergency service until the occupant, owner, or requesting individual has provided the department with a valid structure number on form provided by 911 mapping department.
