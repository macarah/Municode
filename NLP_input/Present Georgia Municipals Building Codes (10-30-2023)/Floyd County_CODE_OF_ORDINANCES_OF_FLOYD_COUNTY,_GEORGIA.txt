PREFACE
Part I, State Laws of Local Application, constitutes a complete recodification of Division I of the 1979 Code, as supplemented through November 23, 1983, and acts and ordinances amendatory thereof. Part II, Code of Ordinances, constitutes a complete recodification of Division II of the 1979 Code, as supplemented through November 23, 1983, and ordinances of a general and permanent nature subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners.
The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent act and ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code of Ordinances have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant general laws of the state have been included. A table listing the general law citations and setting forth their locations within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of three component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the part number, the figure before the second dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the second dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2-2 is numbered 2-2-1 and the fifth section of Chapter 2-4 is 2-4-5. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-8-4 and 2-8-5 is desired to by added, such new sections would be numbered 2-8-4.1, 2-8-4.2 and 2-8-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2-6 and 2-7, it will be designated as Chapter 2-6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters in the Code of Ordinances is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Indices
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory acts or ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. p0;The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Jerry L. Minge, County Attorney and Mr. Richard L. McCullough, County Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.
