ARTICLE 10. - MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS

Sec. 10.1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide standards and regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Meriwether County. Meriwether County recognizes that manufactured housing meets the needs of many county residents for affordable housing and is compatible with site-built housing if developed in accordance with comparable standards. These regulations shall govern the use and operation of all manufactured homes on single lots or within manufactured home parks used for permanent residential occupancy, as well as recreational vehicle parks used for temporary occupancy, in unincorporated Meriwether County, Georgia. It is the intent of these regulations to empower the Meriwether County Planning Commission, the Meriwether County Health Department, and the community development office to review the development of manufactured home sites, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle parks within the unincorporated areas of Meriwether County for compliance with standards as stated in this ordinance.

Nonconforming mobile/manufactured home parks lawfully existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance may be continued, but if such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 90 days, the manufactured home park shall be made to conform with the requirements of these regulations prior to its being occupied again. Any expansion or addition to an existing manufactured home park shall be in compliance with these regulations, as amended.
