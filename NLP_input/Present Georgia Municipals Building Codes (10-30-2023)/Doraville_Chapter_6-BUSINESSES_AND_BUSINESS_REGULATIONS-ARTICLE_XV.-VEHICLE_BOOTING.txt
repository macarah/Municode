It shall be unlawful for any entity to place a boot on a vehicle unless they are licensed by the City and they have paid occupation tax or shown proof of exemption. Every vehicle immobilization service desiring to obtain a license required by this article shall file an application with the City of Doraville Police Department on forms to be prepared and approved by the City. The application shall state the name and address of the applicant; where the proposed business is to be located; nature and character of the business to be carried on; if a partnership, the names of the partners; if a corporation, the names of the officers; the charges to be imposed for various services; amounts and types of insurance held; such other information as may be required by the City; and shall be sworn by the applicant or agent thereof.
(1)
Once issued, operators shall carry with them their permit at all times when they are in the process of installing a vehicle immobilization device.
(2)
It shall be unlawful for any person to be an operator without first having been fingerprinted by the Doraville Police Department and having been issued a permit by the City's Police Department indicating that such person is eligible to be an operator of a vehicle immobilization service or device.
(3)
The City Police Department shall conduct a complete search relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted. If there is a record of a violation of this article, no license will be issued and the person shall be ineligible to be an operator of any vehicle immobilization service or device within the City; however, any person denied a license under this section shall have the right of appeal to the City Council.
(b)
All applicants, whether they are a vehicle immobilization service or an operator, shall furnish all data, information and records relevant to their application requested of them by the City's Police Department, and failure to furnish this data, information and records within thirty (30) days from the date of the request shall automatically result in the dismissal, with prejudice, of the application. Applicants, by filing an application, agree to produce for oral interrogation any person requested by the police department who is under the applicant's control who possess or may possess knowledge of facts relevant to the application. The failure to produce a person within thirty (30) days after being requested to do so shall result in an automatic dismissal of the application. Persons under an applicant's control are the partners of the applicant if the applicant is a partnership, the officers of the applicant if the applicant is a corporation, and/or employees, officers or agents of the applicant.
(c)
No license or permit under this article shall be issued to any person who has been convicted in this or any other country within three (3) years immediately prior to the application for a license or permit of a crime involving solicitation for prostitution, distribution or possession of illegal narcotics, sex offenses, or any other crime involving moral turpitude. Further, to be eligible for a permit under this article, the person applying must possess a current driver's license or state issued identification as provided by the laws of the state. Any person denied a license or a permit under this section or any person whose license or permit may be revoked under this section shall have the right to appeal this denial or revocation to the City Council.
(d)
Should any person with a license or permit obtained pursuant to this article be charged with committing any crime as described in subsection (c) above, then such charge shall constitute the basis for adverse action, including suspension or revocation. The City finds that the offenses listed in [subsection] (c) above are rationally related to prevent the influence of organized crime in the booting industry and to preserve the peace by lessening the danger of violent altercations at booting scenes.
