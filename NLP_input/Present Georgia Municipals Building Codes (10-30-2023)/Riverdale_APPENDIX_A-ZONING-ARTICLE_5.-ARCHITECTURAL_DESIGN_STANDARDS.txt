ARTICLE 5. - ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 5.1. - Mixed-use architectural design standards.
( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.1. - Purpose and intent.
The mixed-use architectural design standards (design standards) seek to create developments that provide a safe, convenient, dynamic and attractive environment through the integration of uses and building design, where people can live, work, and play in Riverdale. The purpose of these design standards is to eliminate the ambiguity for the development community and ensure complementary environments. The building and site design standards set forth in this article integrate land use, urban design, transportation, and architecture that comprise the built environment and address the following components:
EXPAND
• Building Orientation  • Setbacks  • Connectivity
• Building Design  • Landscaping  • Lighting
• Building Height  • Fenestration  • Signs
• Screening  • Streetscape  • Parking and Circulation
  ( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.2. - Applicability.
A.
General. These standards apply to all new construction and modifications within the designated town center mixed-use district mixed-use (MU) districts. These standards shall also be applied to properties that are rezoned to any mix-use. Single-family dwellings are exempt from these provisions. For commercial design standards, see section 5.2, Commercial architectural design standards.
B.
Relationship to underlying zoning district standards. These architectural design standards are supplementary to the TCMU district and MU District development standards established in article 3, other applicable regulations in the zoning ordinance, and other application city ordinances. In any case where these design standards conflict with standards of the zoning district to which they apply or with other provisions of this zoning ordinance, the architectural design standards shall govern.
C.
Modifications to existing structures.
1.
Any building that is nonconforming with respect to the development and design standards of this ordinance or any future amendments shall not be enlarged, expanded, or altered in any manner which may increase its nonconformity, with the exception that the structure may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe and sanitary condition in accordance with article 10, Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, and Lots.
2.
Any existing building that is enlarged, expanded, or altered in any manner would increase its non-conformity must be brought into compliance with the design standards set forth in section 5.1, Mixed-use architectural design standards.
3.
Rebuilding of a damaged, nonconforming building must conform with article 10, Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, and Lots.
D.
Alternate standards. The standards herein are intended to be followed as outlined below. However, at its discretion, the city council may approve minor deviations from the design standards if, in the opinion of the council, the intent of the goals and purpose of this article can be achieved with the proposed minor deviations. Applicants must clearly indicate how proposed deviations further the purpose and intent defined in the guiding principles in article 3, section 3.6.2. The purpose statements in each section in this article. These design standards do not exempt applicants from obtaining all required permits and complying with all applicable city codes and regulations in force.
( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.3. - Building form and location.
A.
Building form and mass are crucial in defining the specific "town center" or "main street" character that many mixed-use developments seek to achieve. Human-scaled, pedestrian-oriented architectural features on buildings help reduce mass so that building form does not overwhelm the public space. A variety of architectural elements can be applied to the building design to create desired massing, which may include windows, doors, columns, masonry detailing, façade articulation, variations in roof lines, building wall recesses, and variations in colors and exterior materials.
B.
Other techniques to reduce mass include integrating view corridors between pedestrian destinations, such as building entrances and public parks. Additionally, the location of buildings on a site and their orientation to the street helps to define the public realm and promote pedestrian activity that supports development.
( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.3.1. - Setbacks.
A.
Building setbacks shall be in accordance with the applicable zoning district standards set forth in article 3. In order to achieve a continuous building façade, side yards between adjoining buildings shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.
B.
A minimum of 60 percent of front façades at ground level shall be located at the minimum setback line to reinforce the building line. When the space between the façade and setback line is specifically designed for pedestrian uses, such as outdoor dining, the maximum setback shall be permitted. The setback of minor portions of the ground level, front façade may vary to articulate building entries, provide variety and maintain a defined, pedestrian-oriented environment.
C.
All multi-family and residential structures shall be built to the same front and side setbacks as commercial buildings.
( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.3.2. - Orientation and location.
A.

B.
Architectural features such as a tower, cupola, etc., located above the roof line, are permitted provided the feature is in character with the architecture of the building, and the total height of the building and feature does not exceed requirements in section 5.1.3.3(a).
( Ord. No. 7-2020 , § 1(Exh. A), 10-26-20)
Sec. 5.1.4. - Building design standards.
A.
The purpose of these standards is to promote high-quality development that incorporates variety in architectural and design elements using attractive, durable building materials to enhance overall visual appearance of the community. Careful consideration of mass and scale, window size and placement, exterior finish materials and decorative elements help define local character and create a sense of place.
B.
Horizontal elements (e.g., belt courses, projecting cornices, canopies, and step-backs) should be combined with vertical elements (e.g., recesses, projecting bays, parapets and vertically aligned windows) in order to reinforce the human-scale. Change in materials or textures is encouraged to accentuate the building proportions and create desired aesthetic for the City of Riverdale.
