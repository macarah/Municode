Section 303.3 Discharge of Swimming Pools. The discharge of water from a swimming pool, regardless of location, size, or use type (public or private), into the environment shall be governed by the following criteria, depending on the type of occurrence:
Section 303.3.1 Major Discharges. The discharge of chlorinated swimming pool water in an amount exceeding that which is necessary for routine back flushing of a filtration system, as a result of normal use or that occurs as a result of overflow caused by precipitation. Quantities exceeding these occurrences shall be required to conform to the following criteria:
• Pool water shall not be discharged directly into any waters of State of Georgia.
• Notice of intent to discharge/drain a swimming pool must be submitted to the City of Sandy Springs at least two (2) weeks in advance of the proposed event.
• Pool water must sit at least two (2) weeks after the last addition of chlorine or until the level of chlorine is below 0.1 mg/l. This is the Reference Dose based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency 2006 Edition of Drinking Water Standards and Health Advisories. It is an estimate of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.
• The ph of the water must be between 6.5 and 8.5 before it is discharged (this represents a neutral range for discharge water that is neither acidic nor basic in nature).
• Discharges shall not be allowed to create erosive conditions.
• Discharge the water in a manner that will prevent nuisance conditions (such as creation of odors and mosquito breeding areas).
• Pool water shall not be discharged onto the property of an adjacent homeowner, without notification and unless a dedicated drainage easement exists in the path of discharge.
• Discharges to the environment should be directed over a vegetated surface to allow filtration to occur.
• Pool water shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer system without prior approval from the local sewer authority (Fulton County Government). Additionally, as a disinfectant, chlorinated pool water is generally not desirable as an additive to a system reliant on microorganisms for effective operation (unless de-chlorinated to the standard listed herein).
• Pool water shall not be discharged directly into the storm sewer system, unless water has been de-chlorinated to a concentration of <0.1 mg/l.
Section 303.3.2 Minor Discharges: the discharge of chlorinated swimming pool water for the purposes of routine maintenance of filtration systems (back-flushing filters), as a result of normal use or as a result of overflow due to precipitation shall meet the following criteria:
• Pool water shall not be discharged directly into any waters of State of Georgia.
• Discharges shall not be allowed to create erosive conditions.
• Discharge the water in a manner that will prevent nuisance conditions (such as creation of odors and mosquito breeding areas).
• Pool water shall not be discharged onto the property of an adjacent homeowner, without notification and unless a dedicated drainage easement exists in the path of discharge.
• Discharges to the environment should be directed over a vegetated surface to allow filtration to occur.
• Pool water shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer system without prior approval from the local sewer authority (Fulton County Government).
• Pool water shall not be discharged directly into the storm sewer system, unless water has been de-chlorinated to a concentration of <0.1 mg/l.
Section 507 STORM DRAINAGE
Section 507.1 General. Drainage of roofs and paved areas, yards and courts, and other open areas on the premises shall not be discharged in a manner that creates a public nuisance.
Section 507.2 Existing Stormwater Management Facilities. Where no maintenance covenant or agreement has been recorded to define maintenance responsibility, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any stormwater management facility (including ditches, pipes, or detention basins) located on their property pursuant to city requirements and as designed, to keep the access easements free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt, or debris.
Section 507.3 Detention Facilities. Detention facilities shall be maintained such that the storage capacity and/ or function of any stormwater basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or manmade, shall not be removed or diminished without written approval of the City.
Section 507.4 Maintain. The term maintain shall include removal of sediment, vegetative growth, debris, or trash that reduces or hinders the facility from performing as intended.
Section 507.5 Inspection. Inspection programs by the city may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws.

(d)
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element.
