ARTICLE 10. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS

Section 1001. - Purpose and intent.
Within the Planned Development District (PD) of the Land Use Regulation of White County, conservation subdivision is a tool for land use development. It is a subdivision that concentrates buildings in specific areas on the development site to allow the remaining land to be used for common open space. The purpose of a conservation subdivision is to protect farmland and natural resources. This method of design normally allows the maximum number of dwelling units permitted under the current subdivision regulations.
In conventional subdivisions, all the land is divided into residential lots and streets, with the only open space typically being un-buildable land such as wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, and storm water management areas. In conservation subdivisions, the neighborhoods are more compact, with smaller lots. A higher percentage of the site is preserved as open space.
Public concern has grown over the loss of open space and rural character that seems to accompany development. One of the main purposes for adopting conservation subdivision design is to preserve open space.
This article is intended to provide for residential subdivisions that are designed based first and foremost on the preservation of open space, but that accommodate the full extent of development that would otherwise be legally possible under conventional subdivision designs, and that:
a.
Minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical resources and historically, archeologically, and culturally significant sites and structures.
b.
Contribute to an interconnected network of permanent open space in the community and provide for undivided or relatively undivided open spaces within new developments.
c.
Create a greater diversity of living environments than is possible with conventional residential subdivision developments.
d.
Foster informal social interaction among neighborhood residents in common open spaces.
e.
Reduce the demand on public expenditures for open space, parkland, play fields, and other areas for active and passive recreation.
f.
Encourage compact patterns that reduce capital costs by requiring less linear footage distances of roads and utilities than conventional subdivision development.
g.
Offer greater opportunities to implement environmentally sensitive sewage treatment and disposal systems.
h.
Encourage pedestrian/bicycle traffic throughout the development whenever possible.
i.
Discourage non-local traffic through thoughtful road design.
j.
Encourage vegetative buffers.
Conventional Subdivision
Open Space Conservation Subdivision
(Res. No. 2017-02, 1-9-17)
Section 1002. - Definitions.
Best management practices: A collection of structural practices and vegetative measures which, when properly designed, installed and maintained, will provide effective erosion and sedimentation control.
Conservation areas, primary: Any property qualifying as conservation use property under O.C.G.A. Section 48-5-7.4; and any steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, water bodies, upland buffers around wetlands and water bodies, critical wildlife habitat, and sites of historic, cultural, or archaeological significance, located outside of building envelopes and lots established for building purposes.
Conservation areas, secondary: Prime farmland, natural meadows, mature woodlands, farm fields, localized aquifer recharge areas, and lands containing scenic views and sites, located outside of building envelopes and lots established for building purposes.
Conservation easement: A legally enforceable agreement between a property owner and the holder of the easement, with content meeting requirements of state law and in a form acceptable to the county attorney and recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court. A conservation easement restricts the existing and future use of the defined tract or lot to conservation use, agriculture, passive recreation, or other use approved by the county board of commissioners and prohibits further subdivision or development. Such agreement also provides for the maintenance of open spaces and any improvements on the tract or lot. Such agreement cannot be altered except with the express written permission of the easement holder and any other co-signers. A conservation easement may also establish other provisions and contain standards that safeguard the tract or lot's special resources from negative changes.
Conservation subdivision: A subdivision, as defined by this Article, where open/green space or common area is the central organizing element of the subdivision design and that identifies and permanently protects all primary and all or some of the secondary conservation areas within the boundaries of the subdivision.
Habitat for endangered or threatened species: An area verified by the state department of natural resources as:
1)
Actually containing naturally occurring individuals of a species that has been listed as endangered or threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act, as amended; and
2)
Being likely to support the continued existence of that species by providing for a significant portion of that species' biological requirements.
Open space: Any combination of primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas, as defined in this article, that together form a permanent, undivided or relatively undivided, undeveloped area. As much as 25 percent of the open space may be devoted to active recreational facilities, as defined. Easements for electric transmission lines or any other above-ground improvement shall not be considered open space except as may be otherwise provided by this article.
Recreation, active: Leisure activities that are facility oriented, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and ball fields.
Recreation, passive: Leisure activities that are natural resource oriented, such as hiking trails, conservation areas, and nature preserves.
Scenic views and sites: Those geographic areas containing visually significant or unique natural features, as identified in the county's comprehensive plan, or by other reasonable means.
Sensitive natural areas: Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; rare or exemplary natural communities; significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which is sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Section 1003. - Relationship to subdivision regulations.
Conservation subdivisions shall be considered and processed in accordance with preliminary and final plat requirements as specified in this resolution, except that in addition the criteria for approval and grounds for disapproval as provided in this article shall also apply to decisions on preliminary plats. Conservation subdivisions shall meet the improvement requirements of this resolution. Where design considerations for lots and blocks are more specifically recommended in this article, they shall be considered applicable recommendations in lieu of those found in other articles of this resolution which would otherwise be applied.
Section 1004. - Primary conservation areas.
Primary conservation areas on lands in conventional subdivisions are permitted to be platted and included in adjacent residential lots. In contrast, a conservation subdivision incorporates, and shall include, all primary conservation areas into undivided or relatively undivided, permanent, open spaces. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this Article, include the following: habitats for endangered or threatened species, wetlands, groundwater recharge areas, flood plains, water bodies, shorelines, and adjacent riparian zones or upland buffers, historic, cultural, and archaeological sites, and steep slopes.
Primary Conservation Areas
Section 1005. - Secondary conservation areas.
Secondary conservation areas on lands in conventional subdivisions are rarely identified and conserved. In contrast, a conservation subdivision identifies, and shall identify, secondary conservation areas and shall integrate all or a portion of them into undivided or relatively undivided, permanent, open spaces.
Secondary Conservation Areas
Section 1006. - Required open space specifications.
a.
Minimum percent of site area. Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total land area as open space, as defined by this article. Areas of above ground utility right-of-way and impervious surfaces must be excluded from the minimum.
b.
Minimum size. The minimum amount of open space required to qualify for an open space conservation subdivision shall be 1.5 contiguous acres. The purpose of this minimum open space acreage is to avoid development proposals that provide only small, scattered open spaces that would not functionally contribute to the overall open space network of the surrounding area.
c.
Permitted uses. In the case of farmland conversion, part of the open space within a conservation subdivision may be permitted to be retained in the hands of the original farmer/landowner or leased to a farmer for agricultural, pasture, or horticulture uses, so long as the activity is undertaken using best management practices to reduce environmental impacts to the extent possible. Open space may not be used for golf courses, roadways, or water impoundments. No more than ten percent of the open space may by used for active recreation spaces. Uses not expressly authorized via the preliminary plat review and approval process are prohibited. Impoundments may not exceed 50 percent of the open space.
1.
Uses of open space may include the following:
a.
Conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources;
b.
Meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, game preserves, or similar conservation-oriented areas;
c.
Walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of porous paving materials
d.
Passive recreation areas (leisure activities that are facility orientated, such as swimming pools, tennis courts and ball fields);
e.
Active recreation areas (leisure activities that are natural resource oriented, such as hiking trails, conservation areas, and nature preserves) provided that they are limited to no more than ten percent of the total open space and are not located within primary conservation areas. Active recreation areas may include impervious surfaces. Active recreation areas in excess of this limit must be located outside of the protected open space.
f.
Agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to minimize environmental impacts, and such activities are not conducted within primary conservation areas;
g.
Landscaped stormwater management facilities, community wastewater disposal systems and individual wastewater disposal systems located on soils particularly suited to such uses. Such facilities shall be located outside of primary conservation areas;
h.
Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines;
i.
Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of this article.
j.
Other appropriate uses that are compatible with the overall scale and character of the subdivision and that are specifically approved by the planning board.
d.
Prohibited uses of open space.
1.
Golf courses;
2.
Roads, parking lots and impervious surfaces, except as specifically authorized in the previous sections;
3.
Agricultural and forestry activities not conducted according to accepted best management practices;
4.
Other activities as determined by the applicant and recorded on the legal instrument providing for permanent protection.
e.
Open spaces shall be named. Each open space shall be given a name appropriate to its purpose and design. Acceptable identifying types of names for open spaces include but are not limited to "common," "park," "green," "meadow," "woods," "farm," and "historic site."
Section 1007. - Conservation easement required.
All primary conservation areas, and all secondary conservation areas shown on the preliminary plat and required or proposed to be retained as open space, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use by a conservation easement. A conservation easement, as defined, shall be approved by the county and
(1)
Donated to a conservation organization or land trust; or
(2)
Donated to a homeowners association; or
(3)
Donated to the county if accepted by the county.
In the case of farmland conversion, part of the open space within a conservation subdivision may be permitted to be retained in the hands of the original farmer/landowner if subject to a conservation easement meeting the requirements of this article.
Sec. 1008. - Guidelines for drafting conservation easements.
The following guidelines are offered for drafting conservation easements and may be required by the county board of commissioners:
a.
The easement agreement recognizes and describes in a statement of purpose the special qualities of the property subject to the easement. The easement agreement must include a map of the tract noting all significant features within the area. The easement agreement clearly identifies the owner of the property subject to the easement agreement, the holder of the easement agreement, and the responsibilities of the property owner, easement agreement holder.
b.
The easement agreement specifically and clearly identifies the boundaries of the property subject to the easement agreement, preferably by metes and bounds legal description and survey plat.
c.
The easement agreement contains restrictions as to what the owner may do with the property and specifically delineates what may not be done with the property. Limitations shall include but may not be confined to prohibitions against subdivision, earthmoving, dumping, signs, utility lines, construction, changes to existing structures, and uses made of the property.
d.
The easement agreement provides for the right of the easement holder and co-signer to inspect the property to assure observance of restrictions. It also provides for enforcement procedures.
e.
The easement agreement provides for the maintenance of property.
f.
The easement agreement contains provisions governing its amendment, including provisions that the easement agreement shall not be altered except with the express written permission of the easement holder, property owner, and any co-signers.
Section 1009. - Homeowners association.
Open spaces may be owned and managed in common by a homeowners association, subject to compliance with the provisions of this article and the following requirements:
a.
The developer of the conservation subdivision shall provide to the administrative official for approval, prior to the approval of a preliminary plat, a description of the homeowners association, including bylaws and methods for maintaining open space. The developer of the open space conservation subdivision shall provide a property management plan or an estimate of the costs and staff requirements for the maintenance, operation, and insurance of the open space and any facilities it includes in the description of methods for maintaining the subdivision's open space.
b.
The homeowners association shall be established by the conservation subdivision developer prior to the approval of a final plat on the property involving a conservation subdivision.
c.
Homeowners association membership of each non-open space lot owner in the open space conservation subdivision shall be mandatory (required) and automatic.
d.
Unless maintenance is assigned to a conservation organization or land trust, the homeowners association shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and taxes on the open space within the open space conservation subdivision. In such cases, the association shall be required to assess dues for the maintenance of open space, purchase of insurance, and payment of taxes, unless another income source is proven to be available. Members of the association shall share the costs of open space maintenance as indicated in bylaws/covenants. The association shall be empowered with the legal ability to place liens on non-open space lot owners for failure to pay association dues.
Section 1010. - Application.
As a part of the preliminary plat application, the applicant for a conservation subdivision shall in addition to the requirements for preliminary plats specified in this resolution, submit an analysis of existing features on the site, which shall at minimum include the following:
a.
Significant wildlife habitats, if any. If information on habitats is not available, the wildlife potential of various soil types on the site shall be identified and examined.
b.
Soils, including analysis of suitability for septic tanks, erosion potential, prime farmland, and identification of hydric soils.
c.
Floodplains. Areas of 100-year flood plains as identified on flood hazard boundary maps or flood insurance rate maps developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
d.
Wetlands.
e.

o.
Planned boundaries of open space, passive and active use.
Section 1011. - Consideration.
Approval or denial of a preliminary plat for a conservation subdivision shall, in addition to criteria specified elsewhere in this resolution for consideration of preliminary plats, be based on the extent to which the plat meets the following criteria:
a.
All primary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space.
b.
A sufficient amount of secondary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space, as opposed to being devoted to lots and other uses.
c.
The configuration of the open space tract is contiguous and undivided, or open space is provided in relatively undivided tracts that cannot reasonably be reconfigured into one contiguous, undivided tract.
d.
Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total land area as open space, as defined by this article.
e.
The conservation subdivision meets the regulations specified in this article.
Section 1012. - Justifiable grounds for denial.
Reasons for the denial of a preliminary plat of a conservation subdivision include but are not limited to the following:
a.
The application fails to fully identify primary and secondary conservation areas.
b.
The proposed method of sewage treatment is inappropriate for the site or found to be potentially dangerous to public heath.
c.
One or more of the lots within the conservation subdivision are too small to be in character with residences on adjoining or nearby properties.
d.
One or more of the lots are significantly large or wide, such that their design contributes to an unnecessary decrease in the amount of open space retained on site.
e.
The street configuration does not provide for connectivity, or preserve natural features, or it is found to be inconsistent with the open space character of the subject property and its surroundings.
f.
The proposed open space network is divided, not functional, inconsistent with open space plans of the county, or does not provide for the protection of the most valuable secondary conservation areas on the site given the natural and scenic properties inherent on the site.
g.
The proposed open space network fails to maximize the length of the common boundary between conservation areas on site and conservation areas or parkland abutting the open space conservation subdivision site
