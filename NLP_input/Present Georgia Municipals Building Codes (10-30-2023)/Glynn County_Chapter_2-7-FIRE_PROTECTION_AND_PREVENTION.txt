There is hereby adopted by the Commissioners for the purpose of prescribing regulations governing conditions hazardous to life and property from fire or explosion those certain codes known as the N.F.P.A.

For purposes of this ordinance, these codes shall be known collectively as the "Fire Prevention Code". One copy of the Fire Prevention Code shall be kept on file in the Office of the Glynn County Fire Marshal. When any provision of the Fire Prevention Code is amended and such amendment is adopted by the State of Georgia, that amendment shall be automatically adopted by Glynn County excepting only those portions specifically deleted, modified or amended by the Glynn County Board of Commissioners.

c.
The Fire Chief shall designate a member of the Fire Department as the Fire Marshal.

Such technical inspector or inspectors shall serve at the pleasure of the Fire Chief.
2-7-3 - Definitions.
a.
Acquired Structure Burn is the burning of a house, building or structure for the exclusive purpose of providing training to fire-fighting personnel or arson investigators.

e.
The terms Alarm System, Low-Voltage Contractor, and Low-Voltage Contracting shall have the meanings specified in O.C.G.A. § 43-14-2, as amended.

Fire Extinguisher means a portable device containing an extinguishing agent that can be expelled under pressure for the purpose of suppressing or extinguishing a fire. The device must be listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory. The device must bear a manufacturer's name and serial number.

g.
Prescribed Burning and Slash Burning means the controlled application of fire to existing vegetative fuels under specified environmental conditions and following appropriate precautionary measures, which causes the fire to be confined to a predetermined area and accomplishes one or more planned land management objectives as specified in paragraphs 12-6-146(3), (4), and (7) of the Georgia Prescribed Burning Act or to mitigate catastrophic wildfires. Burning to facilitate land use changes (such as a change from forest land to residential, commercial, or industrial development or a different agricultural use) is not considered prescribed burning or slash burning, and is therefore considered a land-clearing operation.

The Fire Marshal, with the advice and consent of the Chief of the Fire Chief shall have power to modify any of the provisions of the Fire Prevention Code, upon application in writing by the owner or lessee, or his duly authorized agent, when there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the Code. Provided, however, that the spirit of the Fire Prevention Code shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.
2-7-6 - Appeals.
Whenever the Fire Marshal shall disapprove an application for modification filed in accordance with the foregoing section, or refuses to grant a permit applied for, or when it is claimed that the provisions of the Fire Prevention Code do not apply, or that the true intent and meaning of the Code have been misconstrued or wrongly interpreted, the applicant may appeal the decision of the Fire Marshal to the Fire Chief within 15 days from the date of the decision upon which the appeal is based. The applicant may appeal the decision of the Fire Chief to the Glynn County Board of Commissioners within 30 days of the date of the decision of the Fire Chief.
