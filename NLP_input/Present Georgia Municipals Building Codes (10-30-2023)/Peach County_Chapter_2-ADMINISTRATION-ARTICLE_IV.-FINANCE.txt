(3)
In the event that an apparent successful bidder has withdrawn his or her bid as provided in subsection (i)(2), action on the remaining bids should be considered as though the withdrawn bid had not been received.

(1)
Emergency purchases. An emergency purchase will be authorized when conditions exist which present a threat to the safety, health, and welfare of the citizens of the county and whenever such requirements would cause an undue delay in the delivery of essential county services under such conditions.

Election materials purchase. In circumstances where the state designates a particular vendor for the purchase of election materials, these items will be purchased with a county purchase order without regard to further requirements of this division, excluding budgetary constraints.
(8)
Limited vendor purchases. In cases where available vendors for a given item or service to be purchased are outside the general circulation of the county's legal organ, the board of commissioners may waive the requirement to advertise the request for sealed bid. In all cases where the board waives the advertising requirement, a copy of the request for sealed bid will be posted in a prominent location within the courthouse and all known qualified vendors will be sent a request for sealed bid.
(9)
Used equipment purchases.
a.
In cases where Peach County is seeking opportunities to purchase used equipment, the user agency will write minimum specifications and requirements for the piece of equipment being sought. The purchasing manager will post the specifications with details on the time period that the search for suitable used equipment will be performed and sufficient information for prospective vendors holding used equipment meeting the specifications to respond to the posting and make the availability of their equipment known to the county. The posting will be placed in the courthouse at a location known to the public for such postings, on the county website, and emailed to vendors that have provided an email address. All vendor submissions will be evaluated by the user agency, with consideration being given to price, suitability, specifications, age, condition, and distance.
b.
In cases where the county is seeking opportunities to purchase used equipment expected to cost at least $10,000.00, the purchasing manager will post the specifications with details on the time period that the search for suitable used equipment will be performed by formal advertisement in the legal organ of the county. Said advertisement shall run for two consecutive weeks.

b.
Solicitation or contract name and/or number.
c.
A detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, including copies of all relevant documents or information.

The purchasing manager may request additional information from the protesting party, which must be submitted in writing to the purchasing manager within five working days from the date of the purchasing manager's request. The purchasing manager will forward all documentation submitted by the protestor to the board of commissioners.
(4)
Within 20 working days of receipt of a written protest, the board of commissioners shall either:
a.
Issue a final written decision which responds in detail to each issue raised in the protest and includes a rationale for the decision rendered, or
b.
Conduct, at the county's discretion, an informal hearing to allow the interested participating parties an opportunity to present their positions and supporting facts, documents, justification, and technical information. The county will advise all interested parties of the final decision in writing no later than five working days from the date of the informal hearing.
(5)
The county's decision shall be final. A request to reconsider such decision will only be allowed if relevant data becomes available that was not previously known or if there has been an error of law or regulation. Such a request for reconsideration must be made within five working days after notification of the county's final decision.
(6)
Protests before proposal solicitation. Bid protests alleging restrictive specifications or improprieties, which are apparent prior to bid or proposal opening, must be submitted in writing to the purchasing manager and must be received at least five working days prior to bid/proposal opening. If the written protest is not received by the time specified, bids or proposals may be received, opened, and awarded in the normal manner unless the county determines that it is in the best interest of all concerned to delay any step. Bids will not be opened until five working days after resolution of the protest unless the county determines that:
a.
The items to be procured are urgently required;
b.
Delivery or performance will be unduly delayed by failure to make award promptly; or
c.
Failure to make award will otherwise cause undue harm to the county.
(7)
Protests after opening of proposal solicitation and prior to award. Protests against the making of an award may be made after bid opening and prior to award. Such protests must be submitted in writing to the purchasing manager and must be received by the purchasing manager within five working days of the bid opening. If the county decides to withhold the award pending resolution of the protest, the county will notify all bidders whose bids or proposal might become eligible for award, and offer them the option to extend or withdraw their bid or proposal. Awards will not be made until at least five working days after resolution of the protest unless the county determines that:
a.
The items to be procured are urgently required;
b.
Delivery or performance will be unduly delayed by failure to make award promptly; or
c.
Failure to make award will otherwise cause undue harm to the county.
(8)
Protests after award. Protests received after announcement of an award or after a contract has been executed will only be considered if the county determines that the matter is in the public interest or the protest presents clear and convincing evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, other illegality, or gross impropriety in the selection of a proposal. If a protest is under consideration, the county shall evaluate the proposal at issue a second time in its entirety and use the same evaluation criteria and rating factors applied in the initial review of the proposal. The proposal will be evaluated by the board of commissioners.
(9)
Protests after contract executed. If a protest involving an executed contract is under consideration, the county will notify the selected contractor of the protest and its basis and may, at its discretion, order the contractor to suspend all county work activities. If the awarded contractor has not executed the contract as of the date the protest is received by the county, the contract will not be executed until five working days after resolution of the protest unless the county determines that:
a.
The items to be procured are urgently required;
b.
Delivery or performance will be unduly delayed by failure to make award promptly; or
c.
Failure to make award will otherwise cause undue harm to the county.
(10)
Solicitations and awards for projects funded by the Federal Transit Administration.
a.
The county shall, in all instances involving the solicitation and award of projects funded by the Federal Transit Administration, report any protest or dispute to the FTA within five working days from the date the protest is filed with the county. The county shall provide to the FTA within five working days following the county's decision on the protest, copies of all documents pursuant to the protest and a copy of the written decision pursuant to the protest.
b.
A protestor may file an appeal with the Federal Transit Administration under certain limited circumstances where the bid solicitation and contract award is for a project that is being funded through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), after the county has rendered a decision on a bid protest. FTA's review of any protest will be limited to an alleged failure by the county to have written protest procedures or alleged failure by the county to follow such procedures.
c.
A protestor desiring to do so shall file its protest with FTA not later than five days after the final decision of the county is rendered under the county's protest procedure. In instances where the protestor alleges that the county failed to make a final determination on the protest, the protestor shall file a complaint with FTA no later than five days after the protestor knew or should have known of the county's failure to render a final determination on the protest.
d.
Protests to FTA should be filed with the appropriate FTA Regional Office with a concurrent copy to the county. The protest filed with FTA shall be filed in accordance with FTA Circular 4220.1E, include the name and address of the protestor, identify the county project number, contain a statement of the grounds for the protest and any supporting documentation, and include a copy of the local protest filed with the county and a copy of the county's decision, if any.
e.
The submission of unsolicited proposals for FTA contract funds is inconsistent with county policy to promote a full and open competition among interested parties. The filing of unsolicited proposals for FTA contract funds, therefore, will be deemed inappropriate by the county and returned to the sender, and complaints or appeals calling for reconsideration of such proposals will not be accepted.
