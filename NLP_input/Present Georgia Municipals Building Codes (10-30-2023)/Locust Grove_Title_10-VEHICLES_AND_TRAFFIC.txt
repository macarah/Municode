Chapter 10.08 - PARKING
Sections:

10.08.010 - General provisions.
A.
The city of Locust Grove owns and/or maintains a system of streets, alleys, and public right-of-ways within its municipal boundaries. The primary object of streets is to ensure safe public passage; however, the right to use municipal streets is not absolute or unrestricted. With increases in population and traffic experienced throughout the city, the mayor and council find unregulated on-street parking creates a safety hazard for the law enforcement offices, emergency personnel, and the general public using streets in the city. Therefore, the mayor and council enact these provisions to regulate on-street parking in the city.
B.
The provisions of this chapter prohibiting the standing or parking of a vehicle shall apply at all times or at those times indicated on official signs except when it is necessary to stop a vehicle to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or official traffic control device.
C.
The provisions of this chapter imposing a time limit on parking shall not relieve any person from the duty to observe other and more restrictive provisions prohibiting or limiting the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles in specified places or at specified times.

The following terms expressed herein shall apply to the interpretation of this chapter:

The following are considered major arterial streets: Highway 42/US 23, Bill Gardner Parkway, LG-Griffin Road, Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, and Peeksville Road. Interstate 75 is a specialized type of major arterial due to its control of access and is therefore considered a principal arterial.
"Minor Arterial Street" is a street, highway or road that handles a relatively large volume of traffic and provides connection either within city of Locust Grove or between the city to surrounding areas. The following are considered minor arterial streets: Jackson Street, Lester Mill Road, Locust Road, Bowden Street, Davis Road, South Ola Road, South Unity Grove Road, Tanger Boulevard, and Market Place Boulevard.
"Collector Street" is a street or road that handles moderate volumes of traffic and provides access to adjoining residential properties and developments. The following are considered collector streets: Davis Lake Road, Club Drive, Frances Ward Drive, Grove Road, Hosanna Road, Indian Creek Road, Roberts Road, Shoal Creek Road, Price Drive, Bethlehem Road, and Pine Grove Road.
"Inoperative Vehicle" is a vehicle that is (1) not currently registered with a government jurisdiction as evidenced on the license plate or other current documentation; (2) not currently insured as required by law; or, (3) in a mechanical condition not capable of movement under its own power, such as flat tires, inoperable motor, or chassis damage.
"Local Street" is a street, lane, or road that handles relatively low volumes of traffic and provides access to local homes and/or businesses. For the purposes of this chapter, all streets not classified as either an arterial or collector street shall be considered a local street.
"Width (of street)" is the horizontal distance between the back of curbs for those streets with raised curbs and/or gutters or the distance between the edge of pavement (also referred to as "cart way") for those streets without curbs and/or gutter.
