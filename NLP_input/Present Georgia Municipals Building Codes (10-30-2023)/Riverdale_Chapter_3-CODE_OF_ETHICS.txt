Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-2006, adopted July 24, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former ch. 3, §§ 3-1—3-19, and adding a new ch. 3. Former ch. 3 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 01-14, adopted October 8, 2001.

Sec. 3-1. - Title.
This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Code of Ethics."
(Ord. No. 13-2006, § 1, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 12-2007, 8-13-07)
Sec. 3-2. - Declaration of policy.
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that its elected officials and others appointed to positions of public service:
(1)
Serve others, not themselves;
(2)
Use resources with efficiency and economy;
(3)
Treat all people fairly;
(4)
Use the power of their positions for the well being of their constituents; and
(5)
Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity.
Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public duties of elected and appointed officials, the public interest requires that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of said individuals.
It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this chapter must be interpreted and understood so as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the city's elected and appointed officials should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunities available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears.
The policy and purpose of this Chapter, therefore, is to:
(1)
Make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to all elected officials in the discharge of their public duties;
(2)
Comport with the objective of protecting the integrity of the city and its government;
(3)
Prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service;
(4)
State principles of ethics which are to be applied in public service;
(5)
Identify the minimum standards of ethical conduct for public servants;
(6)
Require that public servants engage in ethical practices which always meet minimum standards;
(7)
Provide a process by which public servants may identify and resolve ethical issues; and
(8)
Promote public confidence in the integrity of public servants and to establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust.
(Ord. No. 13-2006, § 1, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 12-2007, 8-13-07)
