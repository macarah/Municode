CHAPTER I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 9.01. - Purpose and findings.
1)
The City Council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city, further, finds that signs have become excessive and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are as follows:
a)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to implement the policies and objectives of a comprehensive development plan of the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city;
b)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the city in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians;
c)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed;
d)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
e)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city;
f)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city;
g)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for advertisement by the business community located within the city so as to promote the economic vitality of local businesses;
h)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the state constitution and the United States Constitution with the city;
i)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts;
j)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits;
k)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
l)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
m)
To provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
CHAPTER II. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 9.02. - Permits.
1)
Except as specifically excluded from the requirements for obtaining a permit, it shall be unlawful for any person to post, display, substantially change, or erect a sign in the city without first having obtained a sign permit or any other permit required by this chapter or other ordinances of the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, signs which are not visible from a public right-of-way or from neighboring properties shall not be subject to the standards of this chapter.
2)
Sign registration. All nonconforming signs which exceed the maximum height and sign area permitted must be registered with the department within ninety (90) days of notification. The information provided for registration will be the same information required in a permit application under section 9.04. No fee will be required.
Sec. 9.03. - Application information.
1)
Applications for sign permits required by this chapter shall be filed by the sign owner or the owner's agent with the director. The application shall describe and set forth the following:
a)
The street address of the property upon which sign is to be located and a plat map of the property which bears an indication of the proposed location of the sign;
b)
The name and address of the owner of the real property upon which the subject sign is to be located;
c)
Consent of the owner, or the owner's agent, granting permission for the placement or maintenance of the sign;
d)
Name, address, phone number and occupational tax certificate number of the sign contractor;
e)
The type of sign to be erected, the area of the sign, the height of the sign, the shape of the sign, how the sign is to be illuminated (if at all) and an explanation of how the sign is to be mounted or erected;
f)
The payment of a $25.00 review fee with the balance of the full application fee due upon issuance; and
g)
Applications for ground signs shall include a site plan drawn to scale, including a closed boundary survey of the property gross acreage, the proposed location of subject sign, location of all ground signs on the property, entrance driveways from public streets, street rights-of-way, public or private easements, and building locations.
2)
The director shall develop such forms as may be necessary to facilitate the permit application process.
a)
The applicant shall apply for all other permits or licenses required by city ordinances and state laws and regulations. Obtaining a sign permit does not exempt the permit holder from obtaining and complying with all other permits required for the sign structure.
b)
Each application shall contain an agreement to indemnify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses of every character which may in any manner be caused by the sign or sign structure. Each applicant shall present to the department, on a request, a certificate of liability insurance prior to the issuance of a sign permit.
Sec. 9.04. - Time for consideration and issuance.
1)
The director shall process all sign permit applications within forty-five (45) business days of the director's actual receipt of an application and a sign permit fee. The director shall give notice to the applicant of his decision by hand delivery, by electronic mail, or by mailing a notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 45th business day after the director's receipt of the application. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing in conformity with this section. If the director fails to act within the 45-day period, the permit shall be deemed to have been granted. A sticker or other device bearing the sign permit number shall be affixed to the sign structure. The Director may extend the permitting process beyond the 45-day period where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required from the Historic Preservation Commission, or where a Special Exception is required by the Villa Rica City Council—under such cases the Director shall notify the application of the process extension.
Sec. 9.05. - Denial and revocation.
1)
Procedure. The director shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the director shall revoke the permit. Should the director deny or revoke a permit, the reasons for the denial or revocation are to be stated in writing and hand delivered, by electronic mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 45 th business day after the director's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission. Violation of any provision of this chapter and any other applicable state laws or city ordinance regulating signage will be grounds for denying a permit or revoking a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined. "Due cause" is the violation of the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances, state or federal law regulating signage, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements.
2)
Appeals. The City Council shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in the denial or revocation of a sign permit under this chapter. All such appeals shall be heard and decided following the notice requirements of Section 11.11 of the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance, and pursuant to the following criteria and procedural requirements:
a)
Appeal of decision by administrative officials. A denial or revocation pursuant to this chapter shall be appealable by filing with the City Clerk an application for appeal on the forms provided by the community development department specifying the grounds thereof, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the action appealed from was taken. The application fee for an appeal under this section shall be the same as that established by the City Council for an appeal under Section 11.11 of the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance.
b)
Decision of the City Council. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the Council shall make a determination on each appeal. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the Council that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the Council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met.
c)
Time for final decision. A final decision will be rendered by the Council within 90 days from date an appeal is filed. If a final decision is not rendered within the 90-day period, the decision sought to be appealed shall be reversed.
3)
Notice of public hearings. See also Sec. 11.11 of the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance. Notice of public hearing before the Council on any application for appeal or variance shall be provided as follows:
a)
Public notification signs shall be posted within the public right-of-way or on the subject property at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing before the Council. One sign shall be posted for each five-hundred (500) feet of street frontage or fraction thereof along each street on which the subject property has frontage. Signs shall be double-faced and posted so that the face of the sign is at a right angle to the street in order that said signs can be read by the traveling public in both directions. The lettering on the signs shall be printed and at least one inch in size and the sign shall state the nature of the proposed application and the date, time and place of the public hearing before the Council; and
b)
Notice of the nature of the proposed application and the date, time and place of the public hearing before the board shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing before the board and not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Council.

d)
Applications may be withdrawn by the applicant or applicant's representative in writing without prejudice at any time before the vote of the City Council on the application. All fees submitted shall be forfeited in any case where the application is withdrawn after it has been advertised for a public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation.
4)
Certiorari. In the event a person whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the City Council, a person may petition for writ of certiorari to the Douglas or Carroll County Superior Court, based on the address of the subject property and the county in which it is located, as provided by law.
Sec. 9.06. - Permit expiration.
1)
A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and fully installed within six (6) months after the date of issuance; provided, however, that where an applicant can demonstrate that a contractor was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed due to the fault of the contractor, one 60-day extension may be granted by the director or his designee. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If an individual later desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

Routine maintenance and changing of copy shall be permitted as long as such maintenance or changing of copy does not result in or change the shape, size, or design. Any change from a non-electronic format to an electronic format is considered a change in design and not permitted with respect to a nonconforming sign, unless the sign is brought fully into compliance with all requirements at the time of such change. Signs which are structurally unsound or present a hazard to persons or property must be removed within two days upon notification by the city.
5)
A nonconforming sign structure may not be replaced by another nonconforming sign structure, except that a nonconforming sign may be rebuilt where the original sign structure has been damaged or destroyed by nature or an act of God. No such replacement structure may have a sign area or height greater than the original structure in accordance with the guidelines articulated in Section 3.07(1)b of the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance. The standard in Section 3.09 is "A non-conforming building which has been damaged by accidental fire, explosion, or act of God to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When damaged by less than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value, a non-conforming building may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that all portions of the structure being restored are not and were not on or over the property line, the non-conformity is not increased, and a Certificate of Occupancy is issued within one year of the date of the damage."
Sec. 9.15. - Measurement of sign area and height.
1)
The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within twenty-four (24) inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. For double-faced signs, the side of the sign with the largest sign area shall be used in computing the sign area.
2)
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required).
Figure 2: Sign Area Calculations
Sec. 9.16. - Height and setback requirements.
1)
All signs shall be set back as follows, unless a more restrictive setback is specified in conditions of zoning or otherwise in this chapter:

Ten feet from the right-of-way or twenty (20) feet from edge of pavement if a private street and no sign shall project over the right-of-way.
b)
In the Downtown District—Chapter IV, Sec. 9.43-44, all permanently affixed signs shall be setback at minimum five feet from the right-of-way and outside of the required landscape and pedestrian zones.
c)
For a residential use, if the distance from the right-of-way to the front of the principal structure is less than ten feet, signs shall be setback two-thirds of the distance between the curb line and the front of the principal structure on the lot on which the sign is located.
d)
Along all lot lines which are not adjacent to a road all signs shall be within the buildable area of the lot. All signs shall be so located and shall provide such vertical clearance as to provide for safe, convenient and unobstructed passage for pedestrians and vehicles.
e)
Window signs are only allowed on the ground floor of a building.

f)
Sign Visibility Triangle. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines extended of two streets (option 1), or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. However, a sign support structure not more than ten inches in diameter may be located within the required comer visibility area if all other requirements of this chapter are met and the lowest elevation of the sign surface is at least 72" above the adjacent street elevation, with a maximum distance of 42" from the street elevation to the top of the message base (option 2).

a)
No sign shall give off light that glares, blinds or has any other such adverse effect on traffic or adjacent properties. The light from an illuminated sign shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways.
b)

CHAPTER IV. - DOWNTOWN SIGN REGULATIONS

Sec. 9.43. - Sign guidelines for the downtown district (CBD).
In evaluating applications for signs and awnings, the Historic Preservation Commission considers and evaluates a sign in terms of the quality of its design, materials, and relationship to the surrounding business district. A sign should harmonize with and support a district's unique character and foster design quality that compliments the architectural and historic heritage of Villa Rica. Furthermore, a sign must be consistent with the Zoning Code and the following Sign Standards. Applications for signs in the Central Business District (CBD) are subject to review and approval of the Historic Preservation Commission.
1)
Style and Design
a)
Sign style and design should begin with a determination as to whether there is adequate space on the building where a sign would look appropriate. Many commercial buildings are designed with a space for a sign; whether it is a horizontal space (lintel) across the top of the storefront, or a wide space (mullion) separating the storefront window and transom window above.
b)
A building's proportions, as well as the street character and architectural character of neighboring buildings, are relevant to determining the proper size and style of a sign. Where insufficient "sign space" exists on a building, a wall sign with a vertical format, or a projecting sign may be appropriate.
i)
The sign should be coordinated with the overall facade composition, including ornamental details and other signs.
ii)
The scale of the signs should be in proportion to the building, so they do not dominate the building appearance.
iii)
Signage should be designed and placed in order to avoid a sense of clutter or chaos on the building facade.
iv)
A sign should be located on a building so it emphasizes and fits within the architectural features of the facade.
v)
Signs or letters that obscure significant architectural features of a building are inappropriate. Simple designs which are subordinate to the building are appropriate.
c)
Signage style and type should be harmonious with the character of the building with which it is associated in terms of form, design, scale, and proportion.
i)
Custom signs are preferable to mass-produced, standardized signs.
ii)
The use of symbolic, three dimensional signs, such as the red and white barbers pole, is encouraged.
iii)
Use of changeable copy signs is strongly discouraged. Where there is a need for changing advertising, portable signage may be a good solution.
iv)
Electronic message signs are highly inappropriate in a historic district, and are usually not approved.
d)
Use directory signs on multi-tenant buildings to reduce the visual clutter of many signs.
e)
Where several businesses share a building, signs should be coordinated. Align several smaller signs, or group them into a single panel to make them easier to locate.
f)
Similar forms or backgrounds should be used for the signs to visually identify them as serving the same building and make them easier to read.
g)
The individual nameplates on the sign should match each other in size, colors, letter size, case and styles.
2)
Size
a)
Awnings that contain signs will have the sign area of the awning sign deducted from the maximum aggregate sign area allowed for the front facade.
b)
Signs within the historic district should be significantly smaller than those situated on commercial corridors. They should be scaled and oriented to relate to pedestrians, as well as passing motorists.
c)
Size should be determined by the scale of the building.
d)
Generally, freestanding signs should not exceed ten square feet. Smaller signs are preferable.
3)
Placement
a)
Signs that are illegible when viewed from the sidewalk, or are located too high upon a building are not encouraged.
b)
A sign should be located on a building so that it draws an individual's attention toward the building or the use that it is intended to support.
c)
The majority of signs should be concentrated at the street level close to the entrance of the building or storefront.
d)
The use of signs placed on upper levels of a building should be limited since they will be visible over an extended distance and may not be related to the street or entrance level of the premises.
i)
Generally, signs shall not extend above the fascia line or coping line of a one-story building, or above the bottom of the second-story windowsills of a multi-story building.
ii)
Roofs signs are highly inappropriate, except on one story buildings where there are few other good locations for signage and the roof sign is especially well crafted to integrate effectively into the design of the roof.
e)
A sign should be installed in a manner that is appropriate for the building.
i)
Damage to architectural detail when attaching the sign should be avoided.
ii)
Wherever possible, avoid drilling new holes or creating new fixing positions on historic facades, by using existing holes and fixing positions.
iii)
On masonry buildings, it is preferable that bolts extend through mortar joints rather than through masonry units.
4)
Colors
a)
The number of colors used on a sign should be limited. In general, no more than three colors should be used, although additional accent colors may be appropriate. Generally, two colors may be used for all lettering, wording, and accompanying designs and symbols, plus one additional background color.
b)
Sign colors should complement and be coordinated with the overall building colors. The use of subdued, muted, earth tone or primary colors is encouraged.
c)
Sign panels should avoid significant areas of white or cream, which have the effect of visually detaching the sign from the building.
d)
Colors generally best limited to accent areas are bright colors, primary colors and metallic colors.
e)
Use of high intensity colors, fluorescent colors and "day glow" colors is discouraged.
f)
Dark or medium colors are preferred for the main, background part of the sign and light colors for the lettering.
5)
Materials
a)
Sign material should be high quality and limited to painted wood, metal, stone, architectural glass and canvas. Other materials may be considered on a case-by-case basis through review and approval by the Historic Preservation Commission.
b)
Solid wood is recommended over plywood since plywood tends to delaminate with age. "Medium Density Overlay" plywood or marine plywood may be used, but it must be edge banded.
c)
Brushed bronze, antique bronze, aluminum, stainless steel or painted cast iron are appropriate and should have a matt finish and not be reflective nor translucent.
d)
Unfinished materials should be designed and used carefully due to weathering.
e)
Highly reflective materials that will be difficult to read are not appropriate.
6)
Lighting
a)
Use of internal illumination is strongly discouraged. The plastic feel of internally illuminated signs is inappropriate in a historic district. In rare cases, where the wattage is low and the sign is quite dark, internal illumination can be effective and would be acceptable.
b)
Where internal illumination is considered it should be limited to individual cut out letters with only the letter face illuminated, or letters routed out of the face of an opaque cabinet sign.
c)
The light source for internally illuminated signs should be white.
d)
The sign illumination source should be shielded and directed only toward the sign to minimize glare.
e)
Light intensity should not overpower the building or street edge.
f)
Small and discreet modern light fittings may provide an unobtrusive alternative to traditionally styled lamp units.
g)
Illumination of signs on upper levels should be limited to the brightness of lower level signs.
h)
Reversed pan-channel letters with an internal light source reflecting off the building may be used for "halo" illumination.
i)
The light source should not be visible.
j)
Neon should be used in limited volume to ensure that it does not become visually obtrusive and dominate the street frontage.
k)
In certain cases, neon may be more appropriate when framed and shielded.
l)
Wiring conduit for sign lighting should be carefully routed to avoid damage to architectural details and concealed as much as possible.
m)
Copper or colored sheathing should be used for wiring to minimize visibility.
n)
The wiring should be placed between the brick coursing and recesses to reduce its visibility.
7)
Historic Signs
a)
Keeping a historic sign is encouraged, even if the business or product promoted is no longer on site. Retaining the sign can exploit the recognition value of the old name and play upon the public's fondness for the old sign, especially when the sign is a community landmark.
b)
Historic signs add to the overall appearance and character of historic commercial buildings and should be treated as significant features of the property.
c)
Painted wall signs on a building facade should be left intact and not painted over or removed.
d)
Preserve signs that: reflect the history of a building or district; are characteristic of a particular historic period or style; are associated with events, people, or places; are evidence of the history of a product or business; display excellent craftsmanship, use of materials, or design; are incorporated into the buildings design or physical fabric.
Sec. 9.44. - Design guidelines for specific sign and awning types.
In addition to the General Guidelines for all signs and awnings in Chapter IV, Sec. 9.43, the following guidelines apply to specific sign and awning types. These guidelines and those in Sec. 9.43 are intended to encourage strong design and to provide direction on how to achieve that goal. These guidelines are not intended to limit creativity or restrict imagination, innovations, or variety of sign styles, but they seek to preserve and enhance the unique historic and architectural character of the downtown district.
1)
Wall Signs.
a)
When planning a wall sign, determine if a horizontal sign board exists on the building. If so, locate flush-mounted signs such that they fit within panels formed by moldings or transom panels on the facade.
b)
Wall signs should be generally oriented toward the pedestrian, and thus placed on a lower section of the building.
c)
Placing or dimensioning a wall sign so that it spans the pilasters or detailing of a building should be avoided.
d)
The projection of a wall sign should be minimized to the depth of the sign panel or letter so that it is relatively flush with the building façade.
e)
A wall sign should be designed to sit within, rather than forward of, the fascia or other architectural details of the building.
f)
In the case of a restaurant, a menu board is essential and will usually be considered appropriate. The board should be positioned near the main restaurant entrance.
g)
It may be appropriate to place an understated wall sign identifying a building on the band under the cornice (uppermost crown) at the top of a multistory building.
h)
A wall sign should be placed so that it is framed by the architectural details of the building and so that it reflects the fenestration pattern of the building.
2)
Window Signs.
a)
Window signs may be either paint or vinyl applied directly to the surface of the glass or any signage on the inside of the building that is visible through a window or door on a permanent basis and is placed within eighteen inches of the glass.
b)
Only a minimal area should be covered so that the signage does not block the view into the establishment nor appear to be cluttered or chaotic.
c)
Window signage on upper stories, which advertises businesses on the upper stories, is appropriate provided it is not unduly prominent.
3)
Projecting Signs.
a)
Projecting signs should be placed perpendicular to the building, either projecting outward from a building wall or hanging from an architectural support, and should have two faces.
b)
Signs hung from a support should usually be centered on that support.
c)
The lowest point of a projecting sign or bracket shall not be less than eight feet above the sidewalk.
d)
Projecting signs may be illuminated.
e)
A projecting sign should be positioned where it will not damage or visually intrude upon architectural details, and where it will not obscure a wall sign.
f)
Brackets or other suspension devices should match the sign style and should be designed as a decorative or complementary part of the sign. Brackets are not included as part of the size of the sign.
g)
Sign brackets should be made of painted wood or prefinished, pre-painted metal. Guy wires, if needed, should be as inconspicuous as possible.
h)
A projecting sign should be attuned to the mass and scale of the building to which it is attached. A large projecting sign on a small building would compete with the architectural feel of the structure and therefore would not be encouraged.
i)
Generally, the appropriate area for projecting signs is above the storefront windows and below the sills under the second floor windows.
j)
A projecting sign should be located at or near the public entrance to the storefront or building.
4)
Awnings and Awning Signs.
a)
The awning design should be compatible with the architecture of the building and should not obscure architectural details of the building. Further, awnings should serve as an accent to the building's design but should not be the dominant architectural feature.
b)
Awnings and canopy signs should be located in a traditional manner above doors and windows, and should conform to the general shape of the opening.
c)
Awnings may be fixed or retractable, and may have open or closed end panels. Awning valances should be loose.
d)
Nylon, canvas or other similar materials are suitable for awnings. Material should be high quality, colorfast and sun fade resistant. Vinyl or plastic materials are not appropriate.
e)
Fixed awnings should have concealed rigid metal frames.
f)
Awning fabric may be solid or striped.
g)
The length of the awning should be restricted to the length of the storefront opening. Awnings should not continue over masonry piers.
h)
The vertical and horizontal dimensions of the awning should be proportional to the overall projection of the awning.
i)
Awnings shall be constructed and erected so that the lowest portion of the projecting frame shall not be less than eight feet, and the lowest portion of the descending valance shall not be less than 6'-8", above the level of the sidewalk or public thoroughfare.
j)
On masonry buildings, awnings should be anchored through mortar joints rather than directly into the masonry unit itself.
k)
Awning signage is only permitted for first floor businesses, and may occupy a maximum of twenty percent of the valance (vertical surface) area on each face of an awning.
l)
Illuminated/back-lit translucent awnings or translucent letters on opaque backgrounds are discouraged.
5)
Freestanding Signs.
a)
Freestanding signs are only appropriate for properties where the building is well set back from the street and there are no other means of appropriate signage.
b)
Freestanding signs within a historic district should be carefully designed, located, and scaled in order that they not undermine the scale and character of the district.
c)
Monument signs are a generally less obtrusive alternative to a pole sign.
d)
Lighting of freestanding signs is permitted, provided that the lighting is shielded and directed only toward the sign. Internally illuminated monument signs should be avoided.
e)
Freestanding signs should be small in area and low in height to reinforce the pedestrian character of the district. Larger signs should be further set back from the sidewalk in order not to overwhelm the pedestrian.
