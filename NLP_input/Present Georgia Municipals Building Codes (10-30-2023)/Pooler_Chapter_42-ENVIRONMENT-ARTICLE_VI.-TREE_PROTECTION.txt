Sec. 42-196. - Intent.
modified
(a)
The city deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact an ordinance for the preservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the city. It is the intent of this article that all site development, residential, commercial, and industrial, be undertaken with a survey of trees on the portion of land proposed for development and the final placement of the buildings, structures, roads, utilities and other features minimizes the removal of significant trees on the property and to recognize the importance in preserving, protecting and planting of trees for:
(l)
Aiding in the prevention of erosion and sedimentation;
(2)
Reducing storm water runoff;
(3)
Aiding in removing carbon dioxide and other harmful contaminants;
(4)
Generating oxygen into the atmosphere; and
(5)
Enhancing the quality of life and welfare for current and future citizens of the city.
(b)
No trees shall be removed or land disturbing activity shall take place without a tree survey being first performed and without approval of a site plan and landscape plan being approved by the mayor and city council.
(c)
Definitions.
Arboriculture. The cultivation, management, and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines and other perennial woody plant material. The science of arboriculture studies how these plants grow and respond to cultural practices and to their environment. The practice of arboriculture includes cultural techniques such as selection, planting, training, fertilization, pest and pathogen control, pruning, shaping, and removal.
Arborist. An individual trained in the art and science of planting, caring for, and maintaining individual trees.
Buffer. Open space, landscaped areas, natural vegetation or undisturbed areas, fences, walls, berms, or any combination thereof used to physically separate or screen one use of property from another so as to visually shield lights or other nuisances.
Caliper. The diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at six inches above ground level. This measurement is used for nursery-grown trees having a diameter of four inches or less.
Critical root zone. The minimum area surrounding a tree that is considered essential to support the viability of the tree and is equal to a radius of one foot per inch of trunk diameter (dbh).
DBH. Diameter at breast height (dbh) is a standard measure of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split.
International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). Through research, technology, and education, the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) promotes the professional practice of arboriculture and fosters a greater worldwide awareness of the benefits of trees.
Preferred replacement tree. See list of preferred trees in section 42-198.
Preferred retained tree. See list of preferred retained trees in section 42-198.
Significant tree. Any healthy tree, excluding pine trees and Sweet Gums, with a dbh of 24 inches or larger and Live Oaks with a dbh of 18 inches or larger.
Tree. A self-supporting, woody, perennial plant that usually produces a main stem or trunk with a definitely formed crown of foliage and a minimum height often (10) feet at maturity.
Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA). A trade association of 2,300 tree care firms and affiliated companies and was established in 1938 as the National Arborist Association.
Tree fund. An account, maintained by the finance department of the city, of funds contributed from developers as a form of alternative compliance to the Pooler Tree Ordinance. Funds from the tree fund are to be used solely to fund tree planting, maintenance and landscaping projects within the city as authorized by the City Manager.
Tree protection zone (TPZ). The area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines of this article. Defined as a circle with a radius of one foot per on-inch dbh extending outwardly from the tree to be protected or the extent of the drip line, whichever is more restrictive.
Tree well. The opening in the sidewalk used for tree planting. It is usually smaller than a tree lawn and is often used when the physical space between a building façade or the stoop of a building and the back of the curb remains after incorporating and ADA-compliant sidewalk does not allow sufficient space for a tree lawn. Like tree lawns, tree wells may either be existing, reclaimed or newly developed. Because they are set aside for landscaping, tree wells shall be used only for trees and no other objects, or parking.
(Ord. of 12-20-2004, § 2; Ord. of 3-5-2019(1), § I ; Ord. No. O2021-09.A , § I, 9-20-2021)
Sec. 42-197. - Minimal tree coverage.
modified
(a)
Residential tree requirement—A residential lot shall have a minimum of three preferred trees, of which one shall be located in the front of the residence and selected from the large or medium tree species from the preferred species list. All trees preserved on a residential lot must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official.
(b)
Multi-family, commercial and industrial requirement—The minimum allowable post development tree coverage for all development sites shall be 15 existing healthy large species trees (excluding pine trees and Sweet Gums), a minimum of six-inch diameter at breast height (dbh) and larger per acre of developable land (excluding buffers and wetlands). Tree species must be on the approved preferred species list. Each tree with a diameter of 24 inches dbh or larger (Live Oak with a dbh of 18 inches or larger) must be designated on the landscape plan and may count as three trees towards meeting the minimum allowable coverage. Each tree with a diameter of 40 inches dbh or larger must also be designated on the landscape plan and may count as five trees towards meeting the minimum allowable coverage.
(Ord. of 12-20-2004, § 2; Ord. No. O2021-09.B , § I, 9-21-2021)
Sec. 42-198. - Significant trees.
modified
While all types of trees are protected under this article, special emphasis is placed on the preservation of large trees and certain more valued significant species listed in this section. The highest priority shall be given to the preservation of trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 24 inches or larger and Live Oaks with dbh of 18 inches or larger, excluding pine tree species and Sweet Gums. Removal of these significant trees can only be permitted by the mayor and city council during the site and landscape plan review process. If a significant tree is to be removed, the planting of new trees of the same species, or preferred species if the same species is not available, totaling the same number of inches in diameter will be required. Replacement trees shall have a minimum dbh of six inches. Mayor and council may provide to the developer an option for payment into a tree fund in lieu of replacement. If the provision is granted, the developer will pay an amount equal to 100 percent of the value of a healthy Live Oak with dbh of six inches multiplied by the calculated number of replacement trees that otherwise would be planted. Payment shall be made by the developer to the City of Pooler prior to issuing a land disturbance activity (LDA) permit or scheduling a pre-construction conference with city staff.

(Ord. of 12-20-2004, § 2; Ord. No. 2020-10.B , § I, 10-5-2020; Ord. No. O2021-09.C , § I, 9-20-2021)
Sec. 42-199. - Replacement.
modified
If site design alternatives cannot achieve the minimum allowable existing tree coverage, or where pre-development tree coverage is less than the prescribed minimum, the developer will be required to plant the minimum required number of preferred replacement trees no less than two-inch caliper and a minimum height requirement of eight feet. The trees to be planted must be preferred species that conform to the American Standard for nursery stock. Planted or relocated trees should be appropriately placed so as to enhance the overall landscaping of the site. For all sites one acre or larger, no more than 50 percent of trees planted shall be of the same species in order to increase species diversity. Tree species must be on approved preferred replacement tree list. All trees planted or relocated on the site must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official.
(1)
Residential tree replacement. A residential lot shall have a minimum of three preferred replacement trees, of which one shall be located in the front of the residence. All trees planted or relocated on a residential lot must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official.
(2)
Multi-family, commercial and industrial tree replacement. Any tree required to meet minimum tree coverage requirements that is lost after 12 months of final approval by the city building official shall be replaced with a two and one-half-inch caliper tree of the same type. If a significant tree is lost subsequent to development and before final inspection by the city building official, it shall be replaced according to this section.
(3)
Commercial and industrial hardship alternative. Based on the type of development proposed, the mayor and city council may provide an option to the developer which enables him to provide less than the required tree coverage. If the provision is granted, the developer would be required to monetarily reimburse the city for the unused trees. For each unused tree, the reimbursement should equal 100 percent of the value of a healthy Live Oak with caliper of two inches. The city will in turn use the money to fund tree planting, maintenance and landscaping projects on city property.

Sec. 42-200. - Parking lot island coverage.
modified
In commercial, multi-family, educational or industrial projects, replacement trees should be utilized in landscaped islands throughout the parking area with no more than 12 parking spaces per 500 square feet of landscaped island space. The overall project site must still meet the minimum tree coverage required by this article. One large or medium preferred tree species is required for every 12 parking spaces.

Sec. 42-201. - Protection zones.
modified
Protection zones should be established and maintained for each tree preserved on a development site. The area within the tree protection zone must be open and unpaved, except where approved pervious pavers may be utilized or tree aeration systems and tree wells are installed. Building materials, vehicles or tools are not permitted to be stored in such protection zones. The tree protection zone (TPZ) is defined as a circle with a radius of one foot per one-inch dbh extending outwardly from the tree to be protected or the extent of the drip line, which ever is more restrictive. The protective barrier must not be less than four feet in height, be prominent visually and erected completely around the protection zone prior to clearing and/or grading. The use of chain-link fencing is required as a minimum. The barrier must remain in place until the developer has been given permission to take it down by the city arborist. Underground utility lines shall be routed around and away from tree protection zones. Necessary installation through protection zones shall be accomplished through tunneling rather than cutting open trenches which sever tree roots. No change in grade within the tree protection zone shall be allowed around existing trees except for a maximum addition of two inches of mulch. Those trees designated for preservation as shown on the approved landscape plan, or development site plan shall be marked on-site with a bright blue ribbon encircling the trunks of each tree prior to clearing and/or grading of the site. The construction plan must clearly state the purpose and reasoning for the blue ribbons to prevent any confusion at the site.
