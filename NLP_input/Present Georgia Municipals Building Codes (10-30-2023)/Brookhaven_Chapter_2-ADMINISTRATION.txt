By simple majority accept the findings and recommendations of the hearing officer.
(2)
By simple majority accept the findings of fact and reject the recommended discipline, instead substituting its own discipline.

If the subject of the complaint is the mayor or any city councilmember, he will not be allowed to vote pursuant to this section or participate in any hearing held pursuant to this section other than as set forth and allowable by the member charged, nor shall such position be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum.
(c)
If the accused is the mayor or a member of city council, the following procedures shall apply:
(1)
Whenever an elected official is accused of a violation of this chapter, said officer shall first be entitled to a written notice from the city specifying the ground or grounds for any sanction considered. A public hearing at which the City Council can receive evidence relating to removal of that official from office shall then be scheduled and held not less than ten days after the service of the written notice. The parties may consent to continue the hearing date only upon written agreement to the continuance and waiver of any objection under the city charter or otherwise to the continuance.
(2)
At the hearing, the mayor and city council shall preside, except that any elected official who is subject to removal at the public hearing being held shall not preside or otherwise participate in the deliberation or decision. The city council may appoint a hearing officer, who shall not be the investigator who inquired into the charges, to assist it with rulings on evidentiary issues.
(3)
At the hearing, both the prosecutor of the case and the official who is the subject of the hearing will initially be given 15 minutes each for opening statements. The prosecutor shall present the first opening statement, unless he or she reserves some or all of the time for rebuttal. Both sides will then present witnesses, and the prosecutor will present witnesses prior to the official at issue. The prosecutor can also call rebuttal witnesses if deemed necessary. Both sides will also be able to present documents and tangible evidence prior to closing statements. Both sides will then conclude with 15 minute closing statements, with the prosecutor's closing statement first, unless some or all of the prosecutor's time is reserved for rebuttal. The presiding officer at the hearing will have discretion to grant additional time for opening and closing statements upon request and demonstrated reasons therefor, provided that the prosecutor and the official who is the subject of the hearing will be provided the same amount of time for opening statements and closing statements. Any legal authorities that the parties contend may apply to the issues in the case shall be provided by the parties to the city council at the hearing in photocopied form for the record, and all such legal authorities shall be interpreted and applied to the facts by the city council with the assistance of the hearing officer.
(4)
The city shall utilize its subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify at the public hearing at the request of either the prosecutor or the official who is the subject of the hearing. However, the city reserves the right to limit subpoenas based upon the perceived relevance of the testimony or the burden to the potential witnesses. Witnesses shall be sworn and under oath.
(5)
The city shall utilize the Georgia Rules of Evidence during the hearing, except that the prosecutor may present summary evidence of findings based upon an investigation within the city government, provided that the investigator is present, either as a witness or as the prosecutor, in order to testify as to the method of investigation, the witnesses interviewed, the documents reviewed, and the reasons for the conclusions reached as a result of the investigation. Provided the above-referenced provisions are followed, the Georgia Rules of Evidence shall not otherwise bar such investigatory summaries of evidence from being considered by the governing body as evidence.
(6)
Either side may cross-examine any witness, within the scope allowed by the Georgia Rules of Evidence, except that cross examination of witnesses will be limited to the scope of direct examination and examination relating to that witness' credibility. Witnesses shall not be harassed nor irrelevant matters inquired into on either direct or cross examination.
(7)
The officer who is the subject of the hearing shall have the right to counsel during the hearing, and the city may also employ an attorney if necessary to present the evidence as prosecutor.
(8)
The official who is the subject of the hearing may be removed from office by the vote of three councilmembers if, after the conclusion of the investigative hearing, those councilmembers find that by a preponderance of the evidence presented the official at issue violated 2.08 of the city charter or this chapter of the code of ordinances for the city.
(9)
The hearing shall be open to the public, except for deliberations of council in executive session, as required by the Georgia Open Meetings Act. However, the city council reserves the right to remove any spectator who is loud or disruptive of the civility of the proceedings.
(d)
Upon a final judgment and certification of the minutes of the meeting disposing of the matter, the city clerk shall serve the respondent with a copy of the certified minutes and findings and recommendations by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested, or by Federal Express or other overnight delivery service.

An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of the county within 30 days after the final action on a complaint pursuant to this article. The filing of such application shall act as supersedeas.
