• Whether the event will require that the public spaces or facilities to be used or burdened, or the routes and means of access thereto and there from, be temporarily diverted from there dedicated or customary uses, or the public or private users thereof be diverted or excluded from or limited in their use or enjoyment of, or their access to or through, said spaces or facilities, before, during, and after the event.
(3)
A disclosure as to whether the applicant or entity for whom the application is being made has in the past conducted or participated in an event of a substantially similar nature to that which is the subject of the instant application, and, if so, where and when such prior event(s) took place, and whether as a result of such event(s) the applicant or entity became a subject, whether or not then operating under the same name, as plaintiff or defendant, of any legal action, civil, criminal, or administrative.
(4)
A disclosure as to whether the applicant or entity for whom the application is being made has defaulted upon or is in arrears as to any judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant, or entity, whether or not then operating under the same name, as a result of participation in any prior event(s) or a substantially similar nature to that which is the subject of the instant application, and if so, a description of said judgment or order and an explanation for noncompliance.
(5)
An indemnification and hold harmless agreement in favor of the city, its elected officials, officers, agents and employees, in a form satisfactory to the attorney for the city.
If, as a direct consequence of exigent, unanticipated, or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, applicant is unable to file an application not less than 20 days before and event, nothing herein shall be construed as precluding the filing of an application at a later time, but such case the time limits for review by the city, and for review and appeal in the case of a denial of a permit, shall remain the same.
Where an event conducted on, over, upon, or burdening public properties, or employing the facilities thereon, which is also to substantially involve or take place partly or wholly upon private property with the consent of the owner(s) thereof, such owner(s) or their authorized representatives must join as an applicant for any permit for such event.
(Ord. No. 2004-05, 4-26-2004)
Sec. 11-243. - Review by the city.
Within seven working days of receipt of an application, the city manager of the city shall review the application in light of all the contents thereof and the goals, intentions, and presumption of this article as set out hereinbefore, and render a decision and communicate same to applicant, either permitting the event as planned or denying a permit for same. If the permit is denied, the city manager of the city shall provide the applicant in writing a statement of the reason therefore. (First class mail to the address provided by applicant, postmarked no more than seven working days after receipt of the application, shall be sufficient for this, purpose, though not the exclusive means of notice.)
Nothing in this process shall prevent the city manager of the city, at his/her sole option and within seven-day period for approval or denial, to confer with applicant with respect to modifications of applicant's plan for the event, and amend the application to reflect such modifications if agreed to by applicant. However, applicant may neither supplement nor amend its application within seven day period except at the invitation of the city. Any attempt to do so sua sponte shall be deemed a separate and new application.
The city manager of the city may deny the application for permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons:
(1)
The application does not contain all required information, or that information set out is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the city.
(2)
The application contains material omissions, falsehoods, or misrepresentations;
(3)
The applicant or entity represented by applicant is incompetent to contact, sue, or be sued;
(4)
The person applying lacks authority to represent the entity for which the application is made;
(5)
The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions damaged public property, or has not paid in full for such damages, or is in arrears as to judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant or entity, whether under the same name(s) or another;
(6)
The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in connection with events of a substantially similar nature;
(7)
The plan of the event as proposed would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other member of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public);
(8)
The plan of the event as proposed would unduly restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public road, right-of-way, sidewalks, or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event;
(9)
The plan of the event as proposed would constitute an unreasonable disturbance of the peace, or would unreasonably burden lawful commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public);
(10)
The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the State of Georgia, or ordinances of the city, county, or other lawful body or activities which constitute nuisance or tortuous conduct with respect to public or private property or persons.
It is the specific intent of the city in enacting this article to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors enumerated above, which the city finds express and support the substantial and compelling interest of this governing body in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health, and good order of its society, are only bases upon which the city manager of the city shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder, and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant.
(Ord. No. 2004-05, 4-26-2004)
Sec. 11-244. - Revocation.
Notwithstanding the grant of any permit as provided herein, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate an event at any time, or prevent its initiation, should traffic, weather, or other conditions develop which present an imminent and undue danger to those participating in the event pursuant to said permit, to the public at large, or should any consideration or combination of considerations enumerated herein as a ground for denial of a permit arise or first become apparent to law enforcement authorities after the grant of a permit. If in preparation for or after the start of an event for which a permit has been issued, participants in said event violate the terms of the permit or deviate in material fashion from the plan submitted in application for the permit, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate the event.
(Ord. No. 2004-05, 4-26-2004)
Sec. 11-245. - Administrative review by the city.
Upon receipt of any decision by the city manager of the city denying an application, the applicant may within five calendar days file an appeal of said denial with the city councilpersons, which appeal shall be in writing and be sent to the city by certified mail or hand delivery. Upon receipt of any such appeal the city manager of the city shall notify the attorney for the city, who shall promptly (but in case no later than seven calendar days after receipt of the appeal) seek review of the denial of the permit as applied for by the applicant. If no appeal is filed by the applicant, there shall be no duty on the part of the city to seek judicial review of the decision of the city manager of the city. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the applicant from seeking judicial review of a denial of a permit in a court of competent jurisdiction at any time after notification of the decision on the application.
