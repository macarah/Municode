(Ord. of 8-4-2008, § 2-6-11)
Sec. 2-225. - Intent.
(a)
Declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that the mayor and council, city committees, boards, panels, public officials and city employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code of ethics and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city. This code of ethics shall apply to all officials, employees and members of boards and commissions, task forces, panels, and authorities of the city.
(b)
Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality, and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern.
(c)
Procurement of qualified leaders. It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the city of those men and women who are best qualified to serve. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided.
(d)
Dedicated service.
(1)
All officials and employees of the municipality should be loyal to the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointed officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.
(2)
Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the officially recognized confidential nature of their work.
(e)
Distribution of code. The city administrator is authorized and directed to have such number of the code of ethics printed as in his discretion will be sufficient for distribution to the officials, employees and board, panel, task forces, authorities, and commission members, as well as having copies available at the city hall for citizens of the city.

f.
Business activities solely between city officials completely unrelated to city affairs or city business.
(b)

Sec. 2-227. - Disclosure.
A city official who has an interest or a substantial interest that he has reason to believe may be affected by his official acts or actions or by the official acts or actions of city officials shall disclose the precise nature of such interest or substantial interest by written or verbal statement made in a public meeting no more than 30 days, but at least prior to the matter being heard by a body who will be taking official action on a matter affecting such interest and the city official will abstain from discussion and voting regarding the matter. An elected city official shall disclose the nature of any interest or substantial interest he has at the time such matter is presented to mayor and council or other considering body for discussion. Such written or verbal statements shall be recorded into the minutes of the meeting, and thus become part of the public record. Following any disclosure made pursuant to this section, the city official shall refrain from all ex parte communications with other members regarding the application in which he has an interest or substantial interest.

(e)
The city in no way seeks to influence employees in their choice of party affiliations or candidates, recognizing that this is a matter for each person to decide. Therefore, nothing contained herein shall be construed to restrict the right of the employee to hold membership in and support a political party, to vote as he chooses, to express opinions on political subjects or candidates, to maintain political neutrality, to attend political parties after work hours, or to campaign actively during off duty hours in all areas of political activity.
(f)

A party may provide a court reporter for an exact transcript. However, the city shall not be compelled to provide a written transcription. The decision of the ethics committee shall be rendered and submitted to the mayor and council within five days after completion of the hearing.

(5)
At the conclusion of the complainant's case, the respondent shall be entitled to move for dismissal based on insufficient evidence on the part of the complaint. If the respondent makes such a motion and the committee, by majority vote, agrees to dismiss the complaint, the hearing shall be terminated. If either the respondent fails to make such a motion, or, if the committee decides by majority vote to overrule the respondent's motion, the hearing shall continue.
(6)
The respondent shall then be entitled to present his evidence to the committee, if he so chooses.
(7)
The respondent shall then be entitled to testify. The absence of respondent's testimony shall not be viewed by the committee as an admission of any sort.
(8)
If the respondent testifies, then the respondent shall be subject to cross examination by the complainant. All other witnesses who testify in the respondent's case shall be subject to cross examination by the complainant.
(9)
All persons who testify before the committee shall be placed under oath, by either the chairperson or a person designated by the chairperson or the city attorney. The oath shall read as follows:
"Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give in this matter shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
(10)
At the conclusion of the respondent's case, the complainant may offer rebuttal evidence only to those items presented in the respondent's case. At the conclusion of the complainant's rebuttal, the respondent shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence only to those matters presented in the complainant's rebuttal case.
(11)
At the conclusion of all the testimony and closure of all the evidence, the committee members may ask questions of any of the individuals who testified before the committee.
(12)
At the conclusion of all questions by committee members, the chairperson shall end the hearing and permit the committee to deliberate in public. If the committee decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the committee shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require either the complainant or respondent, subject to the respondents right against self incrimination unless the same is waived by respondent, to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The committee has no authority to continue the hearing past the 45-day deadline. The committee cannot require the respondent to testify if he has not already done so, and the respondent cannot be forced to incriminate himself unless he has already testified, presented evidence, or in some matter waived his right against self-incrimination.
(13)
The receipt of additional evidence shall follow the same format outlined in subsections (1) through (12) of this subsection. Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the committee shall continue deliberation then the chairperson shall call for a vote. The committee's first vote must be whether or not the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the committee rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the committee, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the committee must make a second decision by majority vote as to the appropriate penalty.
(14)
At any hearing held by the ethics committee, the public official who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the complaint at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation and to be provided copies of any document in possession of the city or complainant to be used against him at least five business days in advance of the hearing. Failure to provide such documents shall preclude their submission and consideration by the committee.
(15)
The complainant's evidence must prove that the respondent is guilty of the offense charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred to as "a preponderance of the evidence."
(16)
If any question concerning the hearing procedures which is not otherwise addressed in this article arises, the city attorney, or in his absence the appointed legal advisor to the committee, shall resolve the procedural question by advisory opinion, then such opinion shall be adopted or declined by the committee.
