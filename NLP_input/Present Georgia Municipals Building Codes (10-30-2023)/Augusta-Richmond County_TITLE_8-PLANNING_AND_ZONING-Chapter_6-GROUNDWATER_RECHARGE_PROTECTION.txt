Editor's note— Ord. No. 6093 , § 2, adopted Oct. 6, 1998, set out provisions for Chapter 6 to read as herein set out. See also the Code Comparative Table.

Sec. 8-6-1. - Authority.
The Official Code of Georgia Annotated § 12-2-8 requires that certain minimum standards shall be adopted by local governments to protect groundwater recharge areas. This Ordinance conforms to these minimum standards and also the minimum standards of Chapter 391-3-316, Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Planning Division.
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-1), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-2. - Short title.
This Ordinance shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Augusta, Georgia.
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-2), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-3. - Purpose.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Augusta, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Augusta, Georgia and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquafiers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of subsurface. These aquafiers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-3), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-4. - Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(a)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(b)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(c)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.;
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-4), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-5. - Establishment of a Groundwater Recharge Area District.
A Groundwater Recharge Area District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Augusta, Georgia except for those lands which lie to the east of the Center of Georgia Railroad as shown on the map of Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia.
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-5), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-6. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low, based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-6), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-7. - Permit requirements, administration, and enforcement.
Within the Groundwater Recharge Area District, no building permit, site plan or subdivision plan will be approved by Augusta, Georgia unless the permit or plan is in compliance with the groundwater protection standards listed in § 8-6-11,
( Ord. No. 7280 , § 1(8-6-7), 9-6-2011)
Sec. 8-6-8. - Permit requirement.
A building permit or a development permit within the Groundwater Recharge Area District shall not be issued until a site plan or subdivision plat, whichever is appropriate, has been reviewed and approved which illustrates compliance with the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance. The requirements for site plans are to be found in the Site Plan Regulations for Augusta, Georgia, and the requirements for subdivision plats are to be found in the Subdivision Regulations for Augusta, Georgia. Those construction of development projects which are exempted under the Site Plan Regulations are likewise exempted from the requirements of this Ordinance.

Sec. 8-6-16. - Definitions.
(a)
Aquifer — Any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act).
(b)
Groundwater Recharge Area (synonymous with Aquifer Recharge Area) — An area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
(c)
Lot of Record — A parcel of land the dimensions of which are shown on a map on file with the Clerk of Superior Court of Richmond County, Georgia, or in common use by county officials, and which actually exists as so shown, or any part of such parcel held in a recorded ownership separate from the ownership of the remainder thereof.
(d)
Pollution Susceptibility — The relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
(e)
Pollution Susceptibility Map (s) — Maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. These maps are available at the office of the Augusta Planning and Development Department.
(f)
Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas — Areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. These maps are available at the office of the Augusta Planning and Development Department
