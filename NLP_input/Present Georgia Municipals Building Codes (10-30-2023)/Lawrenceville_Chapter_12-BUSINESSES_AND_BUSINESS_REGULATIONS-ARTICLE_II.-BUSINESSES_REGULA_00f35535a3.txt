DIVISION 13. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 12-400. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments. The City considered specific evidence of the undesirable secondary effects of sexually explicit businesses when it enacted the provisions of this section. Before adopting the ordinance from which this article is derived, the City considered and reviewed an extensive report prepared by the City of Austin, Texas, concerning adult-oriented businesses in that city and considered the increased criminal activity around such adult entertainment establishments and the expenditure of additional funds for law enforcement to combat such criminal activity. The City also reviewed studies prepared in Garden Grove, California; Seattle, Washington; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot amount to prohibition; otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this division represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and property values through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
(b)
It is the finding of the Mayor and Council that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment, whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
(c)
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section. The Mayor and Council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in City of Lawrenceville as well.
(d)
Furthermore, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities.
(e)
The Mayor and Council find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City of Lawrenceville are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the experiences of other cities and counties with adult bookstores have shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths.
(f)
The Mayor and Council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Mayor and Council find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The Mayor and Council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, the ordinance from which this division is derived is hereby adopted.
