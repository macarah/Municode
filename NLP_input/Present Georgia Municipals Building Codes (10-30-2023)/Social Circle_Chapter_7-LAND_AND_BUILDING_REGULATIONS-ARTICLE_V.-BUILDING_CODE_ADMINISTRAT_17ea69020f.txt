ARTICLE V. - BUILDING CODE ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 7-201. - Purpose.
(a)
General. This is to provide for the administration and enforcement of the State Minimum Standard Codes ("technical codes"). The city adopts administrative procedures in order to enforce them (O.C.G.A. § 8-2-25(a)). The power to adopt these administrative procedures is in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(a)(1). These include procedural requirements for the enforcement of the codes, provisions for hearings, provisions for appeals from decisions of local inspectors, and any other procedures necessary for the proper local administration and enforcement of the state minimum standard codes. These powers include: Inspecting buildings and other structures to ensure compliance with the code; employing inspectors and other personnel necessary for the proper enforcement of codes; and requiring permits and to establishment charges for said permits.
(b)
Code remedial. These codes and all inspections conducted and permits issued hereunder are remedial, and shall be construed to secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof—public safety, health and general welfare—through structural strength, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment including alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use and occupancy of buildings, structures or premises, and by regulating installation and maintenance of all electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems ("service systems").
(c)
Quality control. Quality control of materials and workmanship is not covered hereby except as it relates to purposes herein.
(d)
Permitting and inspection. The inspection or permitting of any building, system or plan, under this Code shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition of such building, system or plan or their adequacy. Neither the city nor any employee shall be liable for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal condition or inadequacy in such building, system or plan, nor for any failure of any component of such, which may occur subsequent to such inspection or permitting.
(Former § 7-007(1.))
Sec. 7-202. - Scope.
(a)
Applicability. Where different sections of these codes specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.
(b)
Federal and state authority. This section shall not deprive any federal or state agency, or any applicable governing authority having jurisdiction, of any power or authority it had on the effective date hereof or of any remedy than existing for the enforcement of its orders, nor shall it deprive any individual or corporation of its legal rights as provided by law.
(c)
Appendices. Appendices referenced in the code text of the technical codes shall be considered an integral part of the codes.
(d)
Referenced standards. Standards referenced in the text of technical codes shall be considered an integral part of the codes. If specific portions of a standard are denoted by code text, only those portions of the standard shall be enforced. If code provisions conflict with a standard, code provisions shall be enforced. Permissive provisions in a standard shall not be construed as mandatory.
(e)
Maintenance. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All devices or safeguards which are required by the technical codes when constructed, altered, or repaired, shall be maintained in good working order.

If such building, structure or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the building inspector shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. When the building inspector shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no one shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building inspector for inspection and examination per this Code.
On receipt of a credible written complaint or request from an owner, occupant, public safety official, department of family and children services, or a public utility provider, the building inspector shall make or cause to be made inspections to determine the condition of residential buildings and premises. Building inspector staff is authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable times all residential buildings and premises.

Inspection on interruption of utility service. If utility service provided to a premises is interrupted for any reason, other than for non-payment that is cured within 21 days of the date of cessation of the service, before the provision of service is restored to the premises, an inspection of the premises by the building inspector shall be made. The owner, tenant or resident shall notify the building inspector of the need for such inspection, and arrange for a day and time for the inspection to occur. The inspection shall certify that the premises meet the applicable legal standards and codes. The fee for each such inspection shall be $35.00 or as may be set by the manager from time to time, which includes an initial inspection and follow-up within 14 days if necessary. Any additional inspection shall require payment of the fee again to cover the cost.

On notice from the building inspector, work on any building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system contrary to the technical codes or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and be given to the owner or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, the building official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping work.
(d)
Revocation of permit. The building inspector may revoke a permit or approval, if there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to any material fact in the application or plans on which the permit or approval was based.

(f)
Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems that are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. All such unsafe buildings, structures or service systems are declared illegal and shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition per the Code.
(g)
Requirements not covered by Code. Any requirements necessary for the strength, stability, or proper operation of an existing or proposed building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not specifically covered by this or the other technical codes, shall be determined by the building inspector.
(h)
Alternate materials and methods. The codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the building inspector. The building inspector shall approve any such alternate, provided he finds the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. The building inspector shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate.
