Sec. 26-1. - Purpose.
These rules and regulations are intended to serve the following purposes, among others:

(3)
To ensure the effectiveness of public traffic signs and signals.
(4)
To protect property values by ensuring the compatibility of property with that surrounding it; and minimizing the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property.
(5)
To maintain and enhance the visual environment, and to preserve the right of the citizens to enjoy the city's scenic beauty.
(6)
To protect the character and appearance of the various neighborhoods in the city, and attract tourists to the city's.

Sec. 26-2. - Authority and application.

The rules and regulations contained herein advance these significant government interests and are the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve them.
