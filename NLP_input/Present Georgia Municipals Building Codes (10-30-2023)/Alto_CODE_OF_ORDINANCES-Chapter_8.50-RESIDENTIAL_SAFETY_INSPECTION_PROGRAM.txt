( Ord. No. 2019-0709 , § I, 6-25-2019)
Sec. 8.50-5. - Certificates of inspection.
(a)
With the consent of the owner or a tenant of a residential unit, the town building code enforcement officer a/k/a town inspector may inspect the residential unit for compliance with the building code, the fire code, or any other applicable section of the Alto Municipal Code with respect to a residential unit. When consent for inspection is granted by an owner or a tenant of the residential unit, then no probable cause is necessary to inspect the residential unit. In all other situations, the Town of Alto and its town inspector is not authorized to perform inspection of residential units unless there is probable cause to believe there has been a violation or violations of the building code, the fire code, or violations of any other applicable section of the Alto Municipal Code applicable to a residential unit. Conditions which appear to be code violations which are in plain view may form the basis for probable cause. A state of disrepair of the exterior of the residential unit, including but not limited to cracked or broken windows, doors, walls, roof and/or trim, peeling or missing paint or siding, unkempt yard or appearance, broken driveway and other conditions of disrepair such that a reasonable and prudent person, not a legal technician, would conclude under a flexible and practical assessment of probabilities that the residential unit has code violations given its particular factual context, may also constitute probable cause. A complaint by a residential tenant to the Town of Alto and its agents that the tenant building or the tenant's residential unit has a building or housing code violation or utility problem that is the duty of the landlord to repair, and is acting in good faith being that a reasonable person would believe that the complaint is valid and that the violation or problem occurred, may also form the basis for probable cause. Alto may require proof that the tenant has provided notice to the landlord identifying the condition alleged to be a violation prior to undertaking an inspection. Alto may undertake an inspection of the residential unit with the consent of the tenant, authorization by the owner or landlord pursuant to a request to conduct an inspection, or by receiving a warrant for inspection from the Alto Municipal Court or other court of competent jurisdiction. If, after inspecting the residential unit, Alto's designated agents determine the residential unit violates any of the standards set forth in section 8.50-5(b), the director is authorized to require the owner to provide the town with a certificate of inspection as described in section 8.50-5, and have the town inspector cite the owner for violation of this chapter or for code violations. Based upon an inspection of the residential unit determining that there are violations of the building code, fire code, or any other applicable section of the Alto Municipal Code with respect to a residential unit, then said violation shall be probable cause for inspection of any other residential units upon the same tract of real property and which appear in plain view to be in similar condition to the residential unit that has a code violation. Besides the penalties for code violations allowed by section 8.50-11, the owner shall also be responsible for paying the inspection fees as required by this chapter.
(b)
All certificates of inspection submitted under this chapter must state that the unit subject to inspection has been inspected, that the unit inspected complies with the requirements of the building code, fire code, and state law specified in or under the authority granted in this section, and that there are no conditions presented in the units inspected that endanger or impair the health or safety of an owner or a tenant. A qualified rental housing inspector or town building code enforcement officer inspecting a residential unit for a certificate of inspection under this chapter shall inspect for and certify compliance with the following requirements of the building code:
(1)
The minimum floor area standards for a habitable room as contained in the building code.
(2)
The minimum sanitation standards as contained in the building code.
(3)
The minimum structural standards as contained in the building code.
(4)
The occupancy standards as contained in the building code.

The requirement to provide and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms as contained in the building code.
(11)
The requirements regarding fire sprinkler or fire alarm systems (if any) required by the building code.
(12)
The requirements regarding passive fire resistive construction components contained in the building code.
(c)
The director is authorized to adopt and publish a checklist to be used for inspections submitted or conducted under this chapter and is authorized to include additional standards within the building code or fire code so long as the checklist and standards are consistent with the intent and scope of this chapter. No provision in this chapter is intended to impose building or fire code standards for existing structures beyond the standards for existing structures set forth in the building code or fire code.
(d)
A certificate of inspection shall be based upon a physical inspection by the qualified rental housing inspector or town building code enforcement officer of the residential housing units conducted not more than 90 days prior to the date of the certificate of inspection.
(e)
The certificate of inspection shall list and show compliance with the minimum standards for each residential housing unit that was inspected using the checklist provided by the town and shall contain such other information as determined by the director to carry out the intent of this chapter.
(f)
Limitations and conditions on inspection of units for certificate of inspection.
(1)
A rental property that has received a certificate of inspection within the last four years and has had no code violations reported on the property during that period is exempt from inspection under subsection (a) of this section and the inspection required under section 8.50-4.
(2)
A rental property inspected by a government agency or other qualified inspector within the previous 24 months may provide proof of that inspection which the town may accept in lieu of a certificate of inspection. If any additional inspections of the rental property are conducted, a copy of the findings of these inspections may also be required by the town.
(3)
If an owner or landlord is asked to provide a certificate of inspection for a residential unit on the rental property and a selected unit fails the initial inspection, the town may require up to 100 percent of the units on the rental property to provide a certificate of inspection.
(4)
If a rental property has had conditions that endanger or impair the health or safety of a tenant reported since the last required inspection, the town may require 100 percent of the units on the rental property to provide a certificate of inspection.

(6)
If a rental property is part of a rental property complex, the limitations set forth in this subsection (f) shall apply to the rental property complex as a whole.
(g)
The fee to be assessed for a town building code enforcement officer to conduct an inspection under this chapter shall be set by section 8.50-11.
