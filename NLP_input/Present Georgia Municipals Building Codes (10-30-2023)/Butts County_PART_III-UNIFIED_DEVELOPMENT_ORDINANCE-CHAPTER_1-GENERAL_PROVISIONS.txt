Sec. 1.11.00. - Standards for the exercise of the zoning powers.
(a)
The board of commissioners will, when considering a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance, first determine whether the limitation imposed by such an amendment, if any, on the right to unrestricted use of property which might result from the proposed amendment is necessary to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. In considering whether to recommend a change in the zoning classification of any particular property, the planning and zoning commission will balance the benefit to the public of the present zoning classification of the property against the detriment to the property owner and scrutinize the application in light of the character of the land in question and the effect of the zoning decision upon the property owner's rights. In making these determinations, the planning and zoning commission must consider the following:
(1)
The existing uses and zoning of nearby property.
(2)
The suitability of the property for the zoned purpose.
(3)
The length of time the property has been vacant.
(4)
The threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if rezoned.
(5)
The extent to which the value of the property is diminished by the present zoning.
(6)
The balance between the hardship on the property owner and the benefit to the public in not rezoning.
(7)
Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning; provided, however, evidence that the economic value of the property as currently zoned is less than its economic value if rezoned as requested will not alone constitute a significant detriment.
(8)
The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area.
(9)
The impact on the environment including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality and quantity.

Have an adverse effect on the insurance rating of the county, or any substantial portion of the county, issued by the insurance service office or a similar rating agency.
(2)
Overtax the public utilities and streets presently existing to serve the site.
