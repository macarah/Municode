Sec. 18-71. - Conditions of the permit.
(a)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the technical codes. Reference subsection 18-66(j) for time limitations for permit activity.
(b)
Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work.

(Ord. No. 2006-06, § 1(18-38), 2-21-06)
Sec. 18-72. - Fees.
(a)
Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees as prescribed in subsection 18-71(d) have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid.
(b)
Working commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to the penalties as outlined in subsection (o) below.
(c)
Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof.
(d)
Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the schedule of fees and charges maintained by the city clerk and established by the mayor and council.
The multiplier for area adjustment shall be determined as follows:
(Building services department budget)(% of budget provided by building permit revenue) divided by the total annual construction value (as determined by the previous fiscal year permit valuations)
For example: All budget numbers and construction values are based upon data from FY 2004 — 2005 for this example.
Building services department budget is $359,357.48.
Expected building permit revenue (building permits, reinspection fees, mobile home setup fees, demolition fees, and foundation only fees) is $182,221.00 percent of budget provided by building permit revenue is 51 percent ($182,221.00 divided by $359,357.48).
Total annual construction value is $45,010,091.56.
($359,357)(51%) = $183,272.31 then $183,272.31 divided by $45,010,091.56 = 0.0041.
Building permit fees shall be calculated as follows:
(square foot of structure)($ value per square foot) = (number)(multiplier for area adjustment) = building permit fee.
The dollar value per square foot is located within Table A of this chapter.
Plan review fees (commercial projects only) shall be calculated as follows:
(building permit fee)(½) = plan review fee
Remodel building permit fees shall be calculated as follows:
(square foot of proposed remodel area)(½ of dollar value per square foot) = (number)(multiplier for area adjustment) = remodel building permit
The dollar value per square foot is located within Table A of this chapter.
Commercial shell only permit fees shall be calculated as follows:
(square foot of structure)(½ of dollar value per square foot) = (number)(multiplier for area adjustment) = building permit fee
The dollar value per square foot is located within Table A of this chapter.
(e)
Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building alteration, structure, electrical, gas mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. The permit valuation adjustment shall be limited to 25 percent of the calculated value determined by the building official. Building valuation data is included as Table A in this chapter.
(f)
Mechanical, electrical and plumbing permit fees. Calculated separately per schedule listed on each technical trade application type. Reference Table B for these.
(g)
Occupancy permit fees. $25.00 when a new tenant occupies an existing space where no construction or remodeling is needed. A new inspection is required after approval from the Cobb County Fire Marshal.
(h)
Demolition permit fees. $75.00 for any demolition of a structure.
(i)
Reinspection fees. These shall be calculated as follows:
(1)
First reinspection .....$25.00
