Sec. 6-81. - Employment of underage persons prohibited; exceptions.
(a)
No person shall allow or require a person in his/her employment under 18 years of age to dispense, serve, sell, or take orders for any alcoholic beverage.
(b)
It is unlawful for any person under the age of 18 years of age to work as an entertainer in any establishment licensed under this chapter without the consent of the person's legal guardian.
(Ord. of 8-6-13, § 1)
Sec. 6-82. - Regulations as to employees and managers.
The following regulations shall apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises:
(1)
No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or serve in any managerial position by an establishment holding a license under this chapter until such person has been cleared by the sheriff's office or designee indicating that the person is eligible for such employment.
(2)
This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboy(s), cook(s), or dishwasher(s).
(3)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the sheriff's office or such department's designee and upon payment of a fee that shall be established by the board of commissioners and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. Applications must be accompanied by a valid government issued identification card (for example a driver's license or state issued I.D. card).
(4)
The sheriff or his designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the applicant. If there is no record of a disqualifying charge or of violation of this chapter, the sheriff's office or his designee shall issue a permit to the person stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the sheriff or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal.
(5)
No person shall be granted an employee permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the sheriff's office or his designee that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of two years of the date of application and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an employee permit. No person shall be granted an employee permit who has been convicted, pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within two years of the date of application and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense where the conviction or plea was entered pursuant to the Georgia First Offender Act, as amended, so long as the first offender status has not been revoked.
(6)
An employee permit shall be issued for a period of one (1) calendar year from the date of the original application. Employee permits are issued for work at the specific licensed establishment as indicated on the employee permit application and may not be used at another licensed establishment. As noted in subsection (11) below, the employee permit must be in the possession of the employee or the employer while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be available for inspection by members of the sheriff's office or the department of community development staff.
(7)
No person shall be issued an employee permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the sheriff's office for an employee permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from the date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted.
(8)
All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the sheriff's office or his designee or the department of community development.
(9)
Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for employee permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(10)
All permits issued under this chapter remain the property of county and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand by the sheriff's office or the department of community development.
(11)
No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid county employee permit. Employee permits may be kept on the premises, or on the person of the employee. For new employees, a receipt issued by the sheriff's office may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue.
(12)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the sheriff's office or his designee the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the months of June and December. List shall be delivered to the sheriff's office or his designee no later than the last day of each said month.
