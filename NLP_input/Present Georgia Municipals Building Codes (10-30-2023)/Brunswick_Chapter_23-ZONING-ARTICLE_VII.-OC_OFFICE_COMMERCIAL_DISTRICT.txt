ARTICLE VII. - OC OFFICE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-7-1. - Intent of district.
It is the intent of this section that the OC zoning district be developed and reserved for business, office, institutional, specified public, semi-public and residential purposes. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a quiet, compatible and uncongested environment for office-type business or professional firms intermingled with dwellings and certain public or semi-public uses and to discourage any encroachment by unrestricted retail and/or wholesale business establishments, industrial concerns or other uses capable of adversely affecting the specialized commercial institutional and housing character of the district.
