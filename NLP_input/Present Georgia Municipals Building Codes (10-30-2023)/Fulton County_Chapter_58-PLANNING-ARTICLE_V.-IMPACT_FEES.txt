This article is intended to implement and be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan: Unincorporated Fulton County, Georgia, adopted March 15, 1978, amended by the Fulton 2010 comprehensive plan update on May 4, 1988, and on May 7, 1990, and as it may be amended in accord with O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 70 (O.C.G.A. § 36-70-1 et seq.) (Growth Strategies) in the future.
(b)
The purpose of this article is to ensure adequate public facilities are available to serve new growth and development in Fulton County and to regulate the use and development of land so that new growth and development bears a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve new growth and development.
(94-RM-121, pt. 1, art. II, §§ 1, 2, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-166. - Findings.
The Board of Commissioners of Fulton County, Georgia, finds and declares that:
(1)
Land development shall not be allowed unless adequate public facilities are available or are ensured;
(2)
New land development in identified service areas shall bear a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities to serve new growth and development;
(3)
The imposition of impact fees is a preferred method of regulating land development in order to ensure that it bears a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities necessary to accommodate the new growth and development and to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Fulton County; and
(4)
Fulton County must expand its public facilities in order to maintain current levels of service if new development and growth is to be accommodated without decreasing the level of service.

Sec. 58-175. - Credits.
(a)
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements or construction or dedication of land or money required or accepted by Fulton County from a developer or his/her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the category for which a development impact fee is being collected. Credits shall not be given for any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money which occurred more than ten years prior to the effective date of this article.
(b)
Calculation of development impact fees shall include credits for the present value of revenues reasonably expected, on the basis of historic funding patterns, to be generated by new growth and development insofar as such revenues are expected to be available to pay for system improvements (see Appendix A: Credit for Property Tax Revenue, attached hereto as section 58-239).
(c)
Credits under subsection (a) of this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
(1)
For the present value of the construction of any system improvements required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the county will utilize a standard construction cost as established by the department of public works for the assessment of applicable credits. Should unusual circumstances such as difficult topography or wetlands cause the standard costs to be restrictive, a developer may present documentation to the county demonstrating such circumstances for consideration in the calculation of credits.
(2)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land required or accepted for system improvements, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value of contributed land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the current validated Fulton County tax appraisal at the time of dedication; present value shall be calculated from time of dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(3)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of money required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value of contributed money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution or dedication; present value shall be calculated from time of contribution or dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(4)
In the event a developer is issued a building permit for a land use which is determined by the county to result in a reduction in demand for system improvements from an existing land use on the property in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the developer or predecessor in title or interest shall be given a credit for the difference which shall be applied against that parcel of land for which the development impact fee was or will be paid; present value shall be calculated from time of contribution or dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(d)
In the event a building permit is abandoned, for the present value of any previously paid development impact fee for the system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, credit shall be in the amount of the development impact fee paid inflated from the date of payment using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) and shall be applied against that parcel of land for which the development impact fee was paid.
(e)
In the event that a developer enters into an agreement with the county to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of credit created by such construction, funding, or contribution exceeds the development impact fee calculated for the project, the developer shall be compensated for such excess contribution by the county or, at the county's option, from development impact fees paid by other development located in the service area benefitted by such improvements. The present value of any such construction or contribution shall be established by:
(1)
Use of documented prices actually paid by the developer for the system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent); or
(2)
Use of documented prices which would have been paid by the county for such system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), whichever is less.
(3)
The county is under no obligation to make immediate compensation, but will make compensation as funds are available.
(f)
Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article, nor shall credit be given for system improvements or funds for system improvements constructed, contributed, or dedicated after the effective date of this article if an agreement to do so was entered into before the effective date of this article for projects which have already received a building permit.
(g)
In the event that a feepayor has, under previously established conditions of zoning, constructed, contributed, or dedicated system improvements or funds when receiving permits to proceed with only a portion or phase of a project as defined by a particular zoning case, but the construction, contribution, or dedication is in excess of that required by the portion or phase permitted, the excess construction, contribution, or dedication shall be credited against future development impact fees which shall be required as additional portions or phases of the zoned project seek building permits.
(h)
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements.
(i)
The developer must present evidence of the cost and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) estimates of inflation and depreciation.
(j)
Credits required under subsection (b) herein shall be automatically given at the time of fee imposition. Any other credits shall be given only upon request of the developer to the county manager. To receive consideration for such other credits a developer must present evidence or proposals for creditable activities and evidence of value to the county manager at or before the time of application for building permit.
(k)
The county manager shall review all claims for allowance and valuation of credits and make determinations regarding:
(1)
Allowance of any claimed credit.
(2)
Value of any allowed credit.
(l)
Any credit shall be acknowledged in writing and calculated at the time of imposition of the development impact fee.
(1)
Any credit shall be acknowledged in writing and calculated at the time of imposition of the development impact fee.
(2)
A developer may appeal any such determination under the provisions of this article dealing with appeals.
(m)
Approved credits which are in excess of impact fees due for a particular project may be transferred to another project located within the same service area and shall apply only to the same public facility category for which the credits were originally approved. Such transfers of approved credits shall follow those procedures established by the county manager.

(b)
A private agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which:
(1)
Modify the estimates of impact on public facilities according to the methods and provisions concerning the calculation of impact fees, provided that any such agreement allows the county to assess additional development impact fees after completion of construction according to schedules set forth in this article.
(2)
Permit construction of, dedication of property for, or other in-kind contribution for specific public facilities of the type for which a development impact fee would be imposed in lieu of or with a credit against applicable development impact fees.
(3)
Permit a schedule and method of payment of imposed fees in a manner appropriate to particular and unique circumstances of a proposed project in lieu of the requirements for payment under this article, provided that security acceptable to the county is posted ensuring payment of the development impact fees. Forms of security which may be acceptable to the county include a cash bond, a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit.
(c)
Any private agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the county manager for review, negotiation, and submission to the board of commissioners. Any such agreement must be presented to and approved by the board of commissioners prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement shall provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders, or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner. The Board of Commissioners of Fulton County shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities proportionately, consistent with the principles set forth in O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 71 (O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.) and this article.

Sec. 58-178. - Exemptions.
(a)
Pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(1), the public policies expressed in the comprehensive plan, and in accordance with the policies of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, the following development projects are found to promote affordable housing and shall be exempt from the payment of development impact fees as provided herein.
(b)
The proportionate share of any systems improvements costs foregone from exempted projects shall be funded from a revenue source other than development impact fees.
(c)
Affordable housing shall be exempt from development impact fees as follows:
(1)
For "sales housing," all development impact fees which may be incident on a given project in a specific service area or combination of service areas shall be exempted for each unit of affordable housing included in a development according to the following schedule of sales prices:
Sales price equal to or less than 80 percent Fulton County Median Income times 2½: 25 percent of fees exempted, and an additional 2.5 percent exemption for each additional reduction of sales price equal to one percent Fulton County Median Income times 2½. For example:
Sales price equal to or less than 70 percent Fulton County Median Income times 2½: 50 percent of fees exempted.
Sales price equal to or less than 60 percent Fulton County Median Income times 2½: 75 percent of fees exempted.
Sales price equal to or less than 50 percent Fulton County Median Income times 2½: 100 percent of fees exempted.
(2)
For "rental housing," all development impact fees which may be incident on a given project in a specific service area or combination of service areas shall be exempted for each unit of affordable housing included in a development according to the following schedule of rental rates:
Monthly rent equal to or less than 80 percent Fulton County Median Income times 30 percent/12: 25 percent of fees exempted, and an additional 2.5 percent exemption for each additional reduction of monthly rent equal to one percent Fulton County Median Income times 30 percent/12. For example:

Monthly rent equal to or less than 60 percent Fulton County Median Income times 30 percent/12: 75 percent of fees exempted.
Monthly rent equal to or less than 50 percent Fulton County Median Income times 30 percent/12: 100 percent of fees exempted.
(d)
Credits given under section 58-175(a), (b), shall be reduced in proportion to the exemption.
(e)
To be eligible for an exemption, a developer must file an application for exemptions with the county manager before the time development impact fees are imposed. The application for exemption must contain documentation acceptable to the county manager showing that the criteria for exemptions will be met.
(1)
The county may assess additional development impact fees on exempted rental housing if, two years after completion of construction, the development has not, in fact, met the criteria for exemptions and/or if, five years following completion of construction, the development has not, in fact, maintained adherence to the criteria.
(2)
Any developer of rental housing receiving an exemption under this section must report to the county manager the status of the project relative to the criteria for exemption on the second and fifth anniversaries of completion of construction. Failure to report may result in assessment of additional development impact fees.

Sec. 58-203. - Review.
(a)
As part of its annual capital improvement program process, or as part of any other planning process which causes the county to evaluate development potential in any area, the county may review the development potential of any area within the county, whether it be a previously designated service area or not, or the county as a whole. Based on such review of development potential, the county may adjust boundaries of service areas or create new service areas.
(b)
As part of its annual capital improvement program process, or as part of any other planning process which causes the county to evaluate development potential in any area, the county may review capital facilities plans in service areas and modify such plans as a result of development occurring in the previous year and/or requests for permission to develop, e.g. applications for rezoning, applications for land disturbance permits, and applications for building permits. Plans may also be modified as a result of:
(1)
Capital facilities actually constructed.
(2)
Changes in capital facility needs and/or standards.
(3)
Revised cost estimates for capital facilities.
(4)
Changes in availability of other funds applicable to public facility projects.
(5)
Other relevant factors.
(c)
As a result of modifications to service area boundaries and/or capital facilities plans, the county may modify development impact fee schedules, as appropriate, and adopt such revised schedules through official action of the board of commissioners.
(d)
As part of its annual comprehensive plan review process, or as part of any other planning process which causes the county to evaluate the housing market, the county may revise the provisions specified in section 58-178.

(c)
All appeals shall be made to the Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals through the zoning administrator's office following the county manager's decision on the applicability or amount of the development impact fee, or eligibility for or amount of a refund, credit, or exemption. No additional filing fee shall be charged to the applicant. The cost of processing the appeal shall be covered under the three percent administrative cost inherent in the impact fee schedule as permitted by the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(18). Upon filing of an appeal, the county manager shall transmit to the Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed is taken. The zoning administrator shall thereafter establish a reasonable date and time for a hearing on the appeal, give notice thereof to the parties in interest, and the board of zoning appeals shall decide the same within a reasonable time following the hearing. Any party taking an appeal shall have the right to appear at the hearing to present evidence and may be represented by counsel. Under article XXIII, section 22.9 of the Fulton County Zoning Resolution, any action by the board of zoning appeals is a final action. Therefore, if any person is aggrieved by a decision of the Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals, they may take an appeal to the Superior Court of Fulton County within 30 days after the decision by the Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals is rendered.
(d)
A developer may pay a development impact fee under protest to obtain a building permit, and by making such payment shall not be estopped from exercising this right of appeal or receiving a refund of any amount deemed to have been illegally collected.
(e)
The filing of an appeal shall not stay the collection of a development impact fee as a condition to issuance of development approval or a building permit.

Site driveways and roads exclusively serving traffic destined for or produced by the development generating traffic on the site;
(2)
Median cuts made necessary by those driveways and/or roads;
(3)
Turn lanes, acceleration lanes and/or deceleration lanes leading to or from those driveways and/or roads;
(4)
Traffic control measures for those driveways and/or roads;
(5)
Access or frontage roads that are not shown as planned publicly built and/or publicly owned roads in the county's comprehensive plan or in any official State of Georgia highway planning document;

Necessary right-of-way dedications for such project improvements.
Diverted traffic or passerby traffic means traffic which is already on the transportation network which is attracted by the new land development and which may be diverted from another route.
Expansion means road and intersection design capacity enhancements which include, but are not limited to, extensions, widenings, intersection improvements, upgrading signalization, and improving pavement conditions.
Impact means the incremental effect of additional vehicles on a roadway segment.
Intersection level of service means the sum of volume capacity ratios, the actual rate of flow on an intersection approach divided by the capacity of that approach and used in conjunction with the delay factor per vehicle. This ratio is expressed as a level of service and is determined by methods of analysis described in the Transportation Research Board's, "Highway Capacity Manual," Special Report 209, 1985.
Level of service or LOS means, in addition to the general definition in section 58-170, for transportation, a qualitative measure describing the collective factors of speed, travel time, traffic interruption, freedom to maneuver, safety, driving comfort and convenience and operating costs provided by a transportation facility under a particular volume condition. Levels of service vary from A to F. Level of service classifications shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Transportation Research Board's "Highway Capacity Manual," Special Report 209, 1985.
Link level of service for the purposes of the fee calculation shall be determined by the volume to capacity ratios as defined in the county's transportation model.
LOS goal means the performance standard the county proposes to meet.
Public transit means public mass transportation services along with capital improvements, equipment, and operations provided by agencies and/or authorities chartered by the State of Georgia to provide such services in Fulton County.
Road or roadway means arterial or collector streets or roads which have been designated in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan and/or the capital improvements program element of the comprehensive plan, together with all necessary appurtenances including, but not limited to, bridges and traffic control improvements.
Sidewalk shall be considered a project improvement.
Transportation facility means roads, streets, and bridges, including rights-of-way, traffic signals, landscaping, sidewalks, other related appurtenances, and any local components of state and/or federal highways.

(94-RM-121, pt. 2, art. III, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-234. - Impact fee rate schedule.
(a)
In accordance with section 58-172 of this article, the following fee rate schedule is included as table 1, table 2 and table 3 supplements (revised), and made a part hereof to be used to directly calculate fees. The fee rates have been calculated using the following method of calculation and described in greater detail in the "Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan," November 4, 1992, using recognized accepted trip generation rates. Figure 1 (Sandy Springs) and figure 2 (North Fulton County) are graphic illustrations of the transportation service areas (revised).
(1)
Gross transportation impact fee calculation is as follows:
a.
Cost Per Trip by TSA (CPT)
Improvement costs for new capacity (construction and right-of-way)/total projected new vehicle trips = Cost Per Trip
b.
Trip Generation Factor (TGF)
ITE Trip Generation × New Trips Factor (if applicable) × unit of development = Trip Generation Factor
c.
Total Discount (TD)
Tax Discount + ROW + System improvements made = Total Discount (TD)
d.
Fee calculation
CPT × TGF = GIF (Gross Impact Fee)
GIF - TD = Net Impact Fee
(2)
The gross transportation impact fee calculated using table 2 and table 3 supplements include several potential credits:
a.
Credit for future property tax revenue shall be subtracted from all applicable gross impact fee calculations using the methodology outlined in Appendix A, Development Impact Fee: Credit for Property Tax Revenue.
b.
Credit for previous contribution or dedication of land for system improvements or the construction of system improvements as described in section 58-175(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this article shall be subtracted from the gross impact fee calculation.
c.
Credit for previous contribution or dedication of money as described in section 58-175(c)(3) of this article shall be subtracted from the gross impact fee calculation.
d.
Other credits as described in section 58-175 of this article shall be subtracted from the gross impact fee calculation.
(b)
If there is an application to permit development of a land use not included in the fee rate schedule, the county manager shall cause a fee to be established based on the trip generation rates for that land use as published in the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (I.T.E.) "Trip Generation Manual," or in the methods described in the "Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan," November 4, 1992.
(94-RM-121, pt. 2, art. IV, § 1, 2, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-235. - Individual transportation assessment determinations.
(a)
In the event that an applicant elects, in accord with O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(g) and in accord with section 58-173 of this article, an applicant may apply for an individual transportation assessment determination. If it is found that the data, information, and assumptions used by the applicant to calculate the individual transportation assessment determination satisfy the requirements of section 58-173 of this article and the requirements of this section, the individual transportation assessment determination shall be deemed the transportation impact fee due and owing for the proposed development.
(b)
In addition to meeting the requirement of section 58-173 of this article, the applicant shall show the basis of the individual transportation assessment determination including, but not limited to, the following:
(1)
Traffic engineering studies:
a.
Documentation of trip generation rates appropriate to the specific development activity proposed.
b.
Documentation of potential credits attributable to the specific development activity proposed, i.e., the nature and extent of each credit as well as the appraised value of each such potential credit, which can be expected to replace the portion of the service volume used by the traffic generated by the specific proposed development activity.
(c)
All documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies.
(d)
A developer may request a preapplication conference with the county manager.
(e)
The county manager shall provide the developer with an individual assessment determination within 15 working days of the formal submittal of a complete application for an individual assessment determination including an individual assessment study.
(f)
All other requirements being met, nothing in this division shall prevent a developer from receiving a building permit upon payment of fees as calculated in section 58-172 and section 58-233(1) and proceeding while awaiting an individual fee assessment determination. When an individual fee assessment is established, any excess payments shall be refunded.
(94-RM-121, pt. 2, art. V, §§ 1—6, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-236. - Private transportation agreements.
(a)
In accord with the general provisions of section 58-177 of this article and the more specific provisions below, any applicant or group of applicants may propose to enter into a private agreement with the county designed to establish proportional share system improvements appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development or developments proposed.
(b)
Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which:
(1)
Modify the presumption of trip generation set forth in the most current Institute of Transportation Engineers (I.T.E.) "Trip Generation Manual" and provide an impact fee which may differ from that set forth in section 58-234 of this article by specifying the nature of the proposed development for purposes of computing actual trips, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the actual number of trips generated will not exceed the agreed upon estimated trips generated by the development. The agreement must contain language acceptable to the county manager showing that the assumptions of trip generation will be met. Further, language must be included in the agreement to allow the county to assess additional impact fees if, two years after completion of construction, the development has not, in fact, met the reduced assumptions of trip generation and/or if, five years following completion of construction, the development has not, in fact, maintained such reduced trip generation. The agreement must also contain language requiring the developer to report to the county manager the status of the project relative to assumptions of reduced trip generation on the second and fifth anniversaries of completion of construction. Figures to be reported shall include both actual trip generation figures and trip generation as a factor of the project's occupancy rate. Failure to report may result in assessment of additional impact fees.
(2)
Permit the construction of specific transportation improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the transportation impact fee assessable.
(3)
Permit a schedule and method for the payment of fees in a manner appropriate to the particular and unique circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 58-171 and section 58-232(b) of this article, provided that security is posted ensuring payment of the fees, in a form acceptable to the county, which security may be in the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit.
(4)
Permit the substitution of public transit related projects in lieu of or with a credit against the transportation impact fee assessable. Public transit related projects may include:
a.
Dedication of parking spaces for use by public transit users who would park their cars in the dedicated area and ride public transit to their final destinations.
b.
Dedication of land for use as a transit terminal and transfer point.
c.
Construction of bus shelters or other capital improvements including, but not limited to, pedestrian enhancements, which encourage the use of public transit.
d.
Participation by the primary employer or group of employers in an employee transit subsidy program.
e.
Participation of the employer or group of employers in ride sharing programs for its employees.
For subsection (b)(4) of this section, the applicant must describe the extent of the program and expected usage by employees. The county may assess an additional impact fee if the program does not result in the anticipated automobile trip reduction within two years.

Sec. 58-237. - Transportation service areas established.
Transportation service areas, as they are defined and established from time to time in the comprehensive plan are incorporated herein and made a part hereof.
(94-RM-121, pt. 2, art. VII, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-238. - Review.
In addition to or as a part of the review described in section 58-203 of this article, a review of the construction and right-of-way acquisition costs and transportation impact fee rates and other applicable items set forth in this article shall be undertaken annually by the board of commissioners.
(94-RM-121, pt. 2, art. VIII, § 1, 5-18-94)
Sec. 58-239. - Credit for property tax revenue.
(a)
O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(r) requires that development impact fees shall be calculated on a basis which is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historic funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements, including taxes, assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers.
(b)
The following sets out assumptions, analysis, and a draft calculation of a credit intended to meet the above requirements for a transportation impact fee.
(1)
Assumptions. The assumptions are as follows:
a.
Four funding sources have been explored for historically significant contributions to capital investment in transportation system improvements:
1.
General fund bonded debt retirement funds. Each year the county floats a $3,000,000.00 G.O. bond, a variable portion of which is devoted to transportation capital items each year. The history of monies paid each year for the past ten years to retire debt incurred for transportation items has been calculated. Additionally, the amount of money spent each year has been compared to the total county tax base and converted to an equivalent millage rate. For the purpose of calculating the required credit, it is assumed that:
i.
This history of payments is the best information available upon which to base future projections.
ii.
Payments made to retire debt associated with two large referendum bond issues, 1957 and 1963, have been excluded from the calculation on the notion that passage of a referendum bond issue in the foreseeable future is unlikely.
iii.
The use of a calculated equivalent millage rate fairly reflects the relative impact of transportation capital investment relative to the value of property.
iv.
The $3,000,000.00 cap on the annual bond issue will not increase and the portion historically devoted to transportation will not change, but the total assessment will grow at the historic trend.
v.
That the average life of a bond is 20 years and that is the time over which the credit should be calculated.
2.
Operating funds. Various operating funds are spent annually on transportation system items. For the purpose of calculating the required credit, it is assumed that:
i.
The majority of the funds so expended are spent on pure day-to-day operations and need not be considered in any tally of capital investment.
ii.
The remainder are spent on renewal and extension type items and should not be counted as transportation capital investment, especially for system improvements.
Therefore, it is assumed that no operating funds need be calculated into the credit.
3.
Capital improvement fund. From time to time the county transfers monies from various sources (e.g. general fund, state grants, etc.) for expenditure on capital projects. The history of such expenditures for transportation projects over the past ten years has been totaled, with discounts from the total of monies that did not originate from county taxpayers, e.g. state funds, exaction funds, etc. These funds have also been included in the equivalent millage rate calculation discussed in subsection (b)(1)a.1 of this section.
4.
Transfer payments from state and federal governments. Regarding state and federal expenditures on transportation system improvements in Fulton County, it is assumed that:
i.
Amounts of money from intergovernmental transfers are forecast for each project in the CIP. Therefore, "total cost to the county," the cost upon which a development impact fee is calculated, already contains a discount for all intergovernmental transfers.
ii.
Recent history indicates that fewer and fewer intergovernmental transfer dollars will be available in the future. Therefore, the CIP most likely overstates the "built-in" credit for this item.
In summary, for transportation system improvements, the required credit calculated here will be based only on debt retirement associated with the county's $3,000,000.00 annual bond issue with additional funds added based on expenditures from the capital improvement fund; so far as all such expenditures are for transportation projects.
b.
Credits to be given for tax payments should reflect tax payments spent on the same projects being funded by impact fees. Not all future tax payments associated with transportation improvements should be credited to each private development paying impact fees; only those taxes paying for transportation improvements in the same TSA should receive credit.
1.
It is assumed that tax payments used to fund transportation improvements are distributed in equal proportions to all transportation projects as they may be planned throughout the county.
2.
It is assumed that the transportation projects listed in the CIP represent the best estimate available of expenditures, and their distribution, for transportation projects.
3.
For analytic purposes, all planned transportation expenditures for the next ten years have been taken from the CIP and the proportion of such expenditures by TSA has been derived. This proportion is applied to the derived millage rate to estimate an equitable future tax credit. These proportions are:
EXPAND
i. TSA 4101 56.61%
ii. TSA 5001 16.17%
iii. TSA 5003 17.64%
90.42%

Analysis. The analysis is as follows:
a.
The combined expenditures for transportation from both the bond sinking fund and the capital improvement fund were plotted from 1981 through 1990.
b.
Expenditures were projected 20 years using least squares projection method (see attachment A).
c.
The ten-year history of the value of one mill against the unincorporated Fulton County tax base was plotted as in step one.
d.
The value of one mill was projected as in step two.
e.
The actual expenditures and projected expenditures were converted to mill equivalents by dividing expenditures by the value of one mill for each year.
f.
Results of the analysis are both:
1.
A projection of capital expenditures from normal revenue sources for transportation projects, based on a ten-year history.
2.
A projection of a millage equivalents applied to transportation capital projects based on a ten-year history.
See attachment B.
g.
All transportation projects for the period 1992—2002 were listed by TSA from the CIP along with total projected expenditures per year.
h.
Five-year expenditures per TSA were calculated as a percentage of total planned expenditures.
(3)
Application. The resultant millage equivalent multiplied by the TSA's proportional expenditure is applied to the average value of development types in the target area in which the finished project will be located to yield the credit. For instance, in TSA 4101, current Fulton County tax records indicate the average single-family home has a current market value of $163,930.00. This figure is used as the basis for tax credits for single-family homes in TSA 4101.
Note 1: The average millage rate over the projected period is 0.2045. A millage rate of 0.21 has been used to be conservative.
Note 2: The millage rate has been applied for a 20-year period to reflect life of bonds, even though some funds in the calculation basis are not used to pay bonds. This is done for the sake of being conservative.
Example 1: A sales house (assumed to be owner-occupied) in TSA 4101:
$163,930.00 (average in TSA 4101) × 40 percent = $65,572.00
$65,675.00 - $2,000.00 homestead exemption = $63,572.00
$63,572.00/1,000 = $63.57
0.21 mills × 55.50 percent = 0.1189 mills
$63.57 × 0.1189 mills = $7.56
$7.56 × 20 years (average bond life) = $151.20 credit
Example 2: A 100,000 square foot office building TSA 4101. Average value $154.11/square foot land and building; value = $15,411,000.00.
$15,411,000.00 × 40 percent = $6,164,400.00
$6,164,400.00/1,000 = $6,164,400.00
0.21 mills × 55.50 percent = 0.1189 mills
$6,614.40 × 0.1189 mills = $786.45
$786.45 × 20 years (average bond life) = $15,729.00
