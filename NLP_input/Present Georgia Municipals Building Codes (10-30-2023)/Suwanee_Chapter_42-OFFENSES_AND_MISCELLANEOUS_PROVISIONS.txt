ARTICLE IV. - REGULATION OF GRAFFITI

Sec. 42-91. - Definitions.
Graffiti means the unauthorized inscription, defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking or engraving of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances, or by carving or scratching on public or private buildings, structures, places and properties.
Graffiti abatement means the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response.
Private contractor means any person with whom the city shall have contracted to remove graffiti.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § I)
Sec. 42-92. - Findings; nuisance.
The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (e.g. 24 to 48 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear.
Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § II)
Sec. 42-93. - Prohibited.
It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to write, paint or draw, carve or scratch upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage and other structure, trees, and other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as "graffiti", to the extent the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § III)
Sec. 42-94. - Violation.
A violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by either fine and/or incarceration in an amount and length not to exceed state law or as otherwise set forth in the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances. Nothing herein shall prevent the additional remedy of restitution if appropriate.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § IV)
Sec. 42-95. - Notice of removal.
(a)
Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or police officer, or his/her designee, determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, and places which are visible to any persons utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right of way within the city and when weather conditions permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the city manager or his designee shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have two business days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city.
(b)
This notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner(s) name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Gwinnett County, Georgia. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners:
(1)
By personal service on the owner, occupant or manager of the property; or
(2)
By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § V)
Sec. 42-96. - City costs enforceable as a lien.
Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the property owner and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. Any abatement procedure shall be in accordance with the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § VI)
Sec. 42-97. - Removal by city.
Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as set forth by the city's officer, then the graffiti may be abated by the city or by private contractor, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter the premises for such purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city. If the city provides for the removal of the graffiti, it shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located. When graffiti is painted over, the city or its private contractor shall attempt to match the paint with the underlying color of the defected surface. Property owners in the City of Suwanee may consent in advance to the city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes but such consent is not mandatory.
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § VII)
Sec. 42-98. - Severability.

ARTICLE V. - LOITERING AND PROWLING

Sec. 42-110. - Loitering and prowling.
new
(a)
Commission of offense. A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this Code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(b)
Halting or impeding flow of traffic. No person shall congregate with another or others in or on any public way or place so as to halt or impede the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic after having been directed to clear such public way or place when ordered by the police or any other law enforcement official.
(c)
Loitering for the purpose of engaging in solicitation of sex acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to remain or loiter in any public place for the following purposes:
(1)
The solicitation of another to perform or offer or consent to perform an act of prostitution;
(2)
The solicitation of another to perform or submit to an act of sodomy;
(3)
The solicitation of another to erotically stimulate the genital organs of another, whether resulting in orgasm or not, by manual or other bodily contact exclusive of sexual intercourse or by instrumental manipulation.
(d)
Any person found guilty of violating any of these sections shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed 180 days, or both.
