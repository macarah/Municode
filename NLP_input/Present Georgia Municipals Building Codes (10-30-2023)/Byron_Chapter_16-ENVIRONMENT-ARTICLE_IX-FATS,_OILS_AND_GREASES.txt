Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the director of public works or his or her designee. Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when they are deemed necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design and capacity approved by the director of public works, or his designee, and shall be readily and easily accessible for user cleaning and inspection by the city. All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall:
(1)
Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a "sludge pocket."
(2)
Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the users expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor.
(3)
Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said on-site treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in section 16-366 on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the city's wastewater collection system.
(4)
Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in section 16-366. If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the following information:
a.
Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside the building.
b.
Existing plumbing at or on a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site.
(5)
Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the director of public works or his or her designee. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved.
(6)
Understand and agree that: The use of automatic grease removal systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the director of public works, or his or her designee, the plumbing inspector for the City of Byron and the Peach County Health Department. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved.
(7)
Understand and agree that: The city reserves the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of such traps.

Sec. 16-368. - Alternative methods.
(a)
Alternative technology/methods. Engineered alternative technology or methods may be permitted, provided the technology or method meets the minimum performance standards set forth by this section or by the city.
(b)
Biological or chemical treatment agents. The use of biological or chemical treatment agents may be allowed in addition to, but not in lieu of, required grease removal systems, provided the user supplies verification that discharge requirements are being met. To verify compliance, beginning 90 days from the last trap cleaning, the discharge must be sampled four times within 24 hours during the hours of operation and analyzed for oil and grease concentrations. In addition, the depth of bottom and top solids must be measured. This testing must be performed monthly and the results submitted to the city within the same testing month. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the city's daily maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 50 percent of the total depth of the trap, the trap must be cleaned and the process started again.

The notice shall set forth the violation and the measure needed to achieve compliance. The user shall have seven days from receipt of this notice to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(c)
Failure to comply. The city shall have the power and authority to enter upon the property of any user who, after having received a written warning, has failed to comply with the provisions of this article, and take the following actions:
(1)
The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of the occurrence.
(2)
Whenever, the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, or any prohibition, or limitation of requirements contained herein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user.
(3)
If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article or federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief.
(d)
Penalty.
(1)
Any user who is found to have violated any provision of this section, and the orders, rules, and regulations issued hereunder, shall be fined in the municipal court of the city a fine of not less than $300.00. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
(2)
Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article and the sewer use ordinance, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article or the sewer use ordinance, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both.
(e)
Overflow penalty. Any sewer or manhole overflow traced to an inadequately operating grease recovery system or lack of a grease recovery system will result in a service charge to the user. The service charge shall include the cost of cleaning up the overflow and for cleaning grease out of the immediately adjacent contaminated city wastewater collection system. This penalty shall not impede other enforcement actions as deemed appropriate by the city. Additionally, the user shall be responsible for payment of any fine levied by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division against the City of Byron as a result of overflows in the city's wastewater collection system caused by grease traced to any inadequate or absent grease recovery system.
Except as provided herein, for a period of six months following adoption of this article, although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease interceptors. If during this six-month period an obstruction of a city's sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the city's sewer main(s), the city will take appropriate enforcement actions against the generator or contributor of such grease.
In the event there is any conflict between the provisions of this section and the codes incorporated by reference in section 8-1, the provisions of this section shall take precedence.
