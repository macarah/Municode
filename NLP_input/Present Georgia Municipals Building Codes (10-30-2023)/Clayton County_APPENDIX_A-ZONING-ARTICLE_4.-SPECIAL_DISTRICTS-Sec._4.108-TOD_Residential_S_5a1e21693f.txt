Sec. 4.108 - TOD Residential Support (RT).
The TOD Residential Support (RT) Model Ordinance is a companion zone for TOD Core Zones in the proposed high-capacity transit corridors in Clayton and southern Fulton Counties. Its purpose is to respect the single-family nature of many residential areas in close proximity to the proposed transit lines, but to incrementally encourage more transit supportiveness over time.
The intent is not for jurisdictions to necessarily adopt the ordinance wholesale; instead, MARTA recommends adopting only the parts that are not addressed or in alignment with a jurisdiction's current code.
Below are seven (7) components that address small transit supportive actions that are appropriate for single-family residential areas.

RT-1 Purpose:
The intent of the RT Overlay is to encourage incremental residential growth in single-family neighborhoods that are within ½ mile of proposed high-capacity transit stations. The goal of this overlay is to:
1.
Create new housing units while respecting the look and scale of single-dwelling development
2.
Support more efficient use of existing housing stock and infrastructure
3.
Provide housing that responds to changing family needs, smaller households, and increasing housing costs
4.
Foster a more pedestrian-friendly environment.
RT-2 Definitions:
1.
Accessory Dwelling Unit. A residential living unit that is within, attached to, or detached from a single-family dwelling and that provides independent living facilities for one or more persons, including provisions for sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel of land as the principal dwelling unit it accompanies.
2.
Carport. A roofed, wall-less shed, usually projecting from the side of a building, used as a shelter for an automobile.
3.
Cottage Courts. A group of small, detached houses or attached houses centered around a common open space or courtyard.

4.
Duplex. Two dwellings attached to appear as a single dwelling.
5.
Garage. A completely enclosed or indoor space in which to park or keep a motor vehicle.
