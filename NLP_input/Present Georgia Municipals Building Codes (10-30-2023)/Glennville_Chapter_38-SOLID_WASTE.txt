(Ord. No. 99-05B, art. VIII, Â§ 3, 10-6-1998)
Sec. 38-284. - Scrap tire generators.
(a)
Any person who generates scrap tires shall have a scrap tire generator identification number (ID#) issued by the environmental protection division. The ID number shall be used on scrap tire shipment manifests. Separate ID numbers shall be required for generators having multiple generation locations.
(b)
Generators shall initiate a manifest to transport scrap tires from the point of generation to an end user or to a scrap tire processing or disposal facility approved by the environmental protection division. The manifest shall include the following information:
(1)
Name and ID number of the generator;
(2)
Number of total tons (accurate to within ten percent of actual number) of scrap tires to be transported;
(3)
Name and permit number of the scrap tire carrier;
(4)
Date of transport; and
(5)
Destination of scrap tires.
(c)
If a generator chooses to use tons of tires rather than actual numbers of tires on the manifest for passenger and truck tires, the following conversion factor must be used:
Passenger tires: 2,000 lbs. (one ton) = 100 tires, @ 20 lbs./tire.
Truck tires: 2000 lbs. (one ton) = 20 tires, @ 100 lbs./tire.
(d)
Unless otherwise approved in writing by the environmental protection division, generators shall ensure that any person collecting and transporting their scrap tires hold a valid scrap tire carrier permit issued by the environmental protection division; provided, however, that a person who generates less than 100 tires per month and who transport only their own scrap tire to approved end users, processors, recyclers or disposers are not required to have a scrap tire carrier permit, but must comply with all other provisions required of generators and scrap tire carriers.
(e)
Generators shall maintain receipts (copies of completed manifest) for a period of three years.
(f)
A generator shall report to the environmental protection division any carrier who fails to return a properly completed manifest to the generator within 30 days of scrap tire pickup. Such report shall be filed within 30 days of failure of the carrier to comply.
(g)
Generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage, or defect is not suitable for classification as a "used tire" or "retreadable casing" as defined in section 38-1. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used," "retreadable casings," or "scrap tires," then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be indicated as such on the shipment manifest.
