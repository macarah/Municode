No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The applicant must not be less than 21 years of age. Applicants may choose to employ a registered agent for the administration of the license.

If the applicant is a partnership or corporation, then the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, officers and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder (if an individual). If the majority stockholder is not an individual, then the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership; or if no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership shall be licensed.

If the applicant is a non-profit club, then the managing agent may be an officer of the organization rather than a full-time employee if such managing agent is qualified in accord with this section.
(4)
No person shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless proper information establishes to the satisfaction of the department of community development or its designee that such person, partners in the firm, officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere, and has been released from parole or probation, to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of two years immediately prior to the filing of such application. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant, nor any of the other owners of the establishment, has been so convicted in the two years preceding the filing of the application. An applicant's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. If any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages, including sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual related crime, then the license shall be immediately revoked and canceled.

No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who has had any license issued under the police powers of the county previously revoked within two years prior to the filing of the application.
(8)
The department of community development may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section for the licensee.
(9)
Licensed establishments may choose to maintain in the county a registered agent as indicated in subsection (b)(1). The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the department of community development on such forms as the department of community development may prescribe. If a licensed establishment changes the registered agent during the year for which license is issued, then the registered agent assuming such responsibility in accord with the terms hereof shall meet all requirements of this chapter.
(10)
All applicants for any alcoholic beverage license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks, or other employees shall be of like character. Corporate or firm applicants shall be of good business reputation.
(11)
A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license if the applicant lacks adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or if the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever.
(12)
The department of community development may, in its discretion, consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the public health, safety, welfare, and morals, then such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.
(13)
