Individual garages for units may not face a primary street.
4.
Fencing that is visible from any public plaza, open space, ground level or sidewalk level outdoor dining area, internal main private drive or public street or right-of-way shall be made only of brick, stone, hard-coat stucco, or wrought iron. No fencing allowed in the front yard of any property along a public right-of-way.
