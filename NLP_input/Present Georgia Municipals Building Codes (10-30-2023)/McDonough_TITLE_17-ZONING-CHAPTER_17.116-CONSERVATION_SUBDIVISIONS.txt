Editor's note— Ord. No. 08-12-29, § XVII(3), adopted Dec. 29, 2008, repealed Title 17, Ch. 17.116, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to this amendment, Ch. 17.116 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 07-10-15(A), § 1, 10-15-2007.

Sections:
17.116.010 - Purposes.
A.
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
B.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
C.
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
D.
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces mid utility casements, necessary for residential development.
E.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
F.
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
G.
To promote contiguous green space with adjacent jurisdictions.
H.
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
I.
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
J.
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
K.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.

17.116.020 - General Regulations.
A.
Applicability of Regulations. This Conservation Subdivision option is available as a use by right in the KA-200 and R-100 zoning districts. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws.
B.
Ownership of Development Site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
C.
Housing Density Determination. The maximum number of lots in the Conservation Subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
1.
Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
Slopes over 25% of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
b.
The 100-year floodplain;
c.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; and
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corp of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
2.
Yield Plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended [to] yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
(Ord. No. 08-12-29, § XVII(3), 12-29-2008)

Instrument of Permanent Protection Required. An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant, shall be placed on the Open Space concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
D.
Other Requirements. The Applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of the underlying zoning and the subdivision code.
