DIVISION 2. - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

Sec. 70-26. - Purpose of article.
This article shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons to meet appropriate due process standards, and to ensure that the county complies with the ACS and implementing regulations.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 8)
Sec. 70-27. - Basis of procedure; complaints addressed to county clerk.
(a)
The county has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the U.S. Department of Justice regulations implementing Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). Title II states, in part, that "…no otherwise qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason of such disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination…" in programs or activities sponsored by a public entity.
(b)
Complaints should be addressed to the county clerk, who has been designated to coordinate ADA compliance efforts.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2))
Sec. 70-28. - Form and content of complaint.
A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 1)
Sec. 70-29. - Filing deadline.
A complaint should be filed within ten days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. Processing of the allegations of discrimination which occurred before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 2)
Sec. 70-30. - Investigation.
An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of complaint. The investigation shall be conducted by the county administrator. These rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations affording all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a complaint. Under the Department of Justice regulations, the county need not process complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to post-secondary educational institutions.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 3)
Sec. 70-31. - Issuance of determination as to validity; resolution.
A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a description of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the county administrator and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than 30 days after its filing.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 4)
Sec. 70-32. - Maintenance of files and records.
The ADA coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the county relating to the complaints filed.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 5)
Sec. 70-33. - Request for reconsideration.
The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for reconsideration should be made within five days to the board of commissioners.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 6)
Sec. 70-34. - Pursuit of other remedies.
The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed under this article shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of an ADA complaint with the responsible federal department or agency. Use of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
(Res. of 10-7-92(2), § 7)
