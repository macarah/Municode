(a)
Any person having a complaint against the mayor or any member of the city council for an alleged ethics violation as defined in this article shall file in writing a verified complaint alleging, with specificity and particularity, significant facts and circumstances which, if true, would be sufficient to establish a violation. The complaint shall be filed with the mayor, or in the event the complaint regards the mayor, shall be filed with the mayor pro tem.
(b)
Upon receipt of a complaint, a determination shall be made whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. For purposes of this determination:
(1)
Facts and circumstances are "significant" if they are key to the alleged violation underlying the complaint and not merely extraneous or tangential; and
(2)
Significant facts and circumstances are "sufficient to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics" if they are not found to be frivolous, unfounded, unjustified, speculative, based on rumor or conjecture, based on hearsay or other inherently unreliable evidence, or deficient for some other appropriate reason.
(c)
To facilitate the determination stated in this section, the mayor or the mayor pro tem, as appropriate:
(1)
Shall appoint three members of the council (or himself and two members of the council) who, along with the city attorney, shall constitute an investigating committee tasked with making said determination; or
(2)
Shall direct that, following an administrative review of the complaint (conducted in consultation with the city attorney), an administrative report shall be submitted to the council which, acting as a committee of the whole, shall make said determination based on its review of the information set forth in said report.
(d)
In the event the complaint, or alternatively, the administrative report, is determined to not set forth significant facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, it shall be dismissed with no further action taken apart from issuance of appropriate notifications. In the event the complaint is found to set forth significant facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, the board shall be appointed as provided in this article.

(3)
The city manager or his designee shall maintain a listing of these 14 qualified citizens. Should the investigating committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the first public meeting after such determination, shall draw names randomly from the listing of qualified citizens until the specified five members of the board of ethics have been appointed. Such board will elect one of its members to serve as chairperson.
(4)

Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies, equipment and legal support services as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities. The city attorney shall initially respond to legal support issues, but may then designate such other legal counsel as, in the opinion of the city attorney, may be appropriate in consideration of potential conflicts and in keeping with the code of professional responsibility.
(b)
Duties and powers. The constituted board of ethics shall have the following duties and powers:
(1)
To establish procedures, rules and regulations governing its internal organization and conduct of its affairs;
