Sec. 71. - R-1 Residential

Purpose: This is strictly a residential district to be used for single-family residential areas with low population densities. Additional permitted uses, by review of the Planning Commission, include related non-commercial, recreational, religious, and educational facilities normally required to provide the fundamental elements of such residential areas. The district is intended to promote development of this character and may also contain vacant or agricultural land considered appropriate for this type of residential development in the future. The specific intent of the R-1 zoning is:
1.
To encourage the construction of, and the use of land for single-family dwellings;
2.
To prohibit business, commercial, or industrial use of the land, and to prohibit any other use which would substantially interfere with the development or maintenance of single-family dwellings in the district;
3.
To discourage land use which would generate traffic on minor or local streets, other than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets;
4.
To discourage any use which, because of its character or size, would excessively impact the requirements or costs for public services (such as fire or police protection and water or sewer services) beyond what would be the case were the district solely developed for single-family dwellings.
Within any R-1 district the following uses are permitted:
Uses Permitted:
1.
Single-family dwellings;
2.
Forest and agricultural uses except commercial dairies or commercial raising of livestock or poultry;
