modified
(a)
The city clerk shall be sworn into office by the city attorney, or by some other officer duly authorized by law to administer such oaths, at the first regular meeting after his or her appointment has been approved by the commission, and he or her shall, before being qualified, give a bond in such sum as the commission or city manager may fix, with good security, payable to the city and conditioned for the faithful discharge of his or her duties. In addition, the oath taken and subscribed shall comply with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 45-3-1—45-3-10.
(b)
In the event of the absence of the city clerk, the city finance director (since the City Charter provides that the department of finance includes the office of city clerk) shall be the acting city clerk who shall also take the same oath as the city clerk and be sworn by the city attorney, or by some other officer duly authorized by law to administer such oaths.
(c)
Both the city clerk and the city finance director shall be a notary public under Georgia law and hold a valid Georgia notary public commission.
(d)
In the event of an emergency when both the city clerk and city finance director are absent, unavailable due to having to perform or conduct other official duties or because the positions of finance director and city clerk are both vacant and unfilled, the city manager shall designate a competent city employee to be the acting city clerk for appearing and performing the duties of city clerk at city commission meetings (regular and called) and work sessions only. The city manager's designee, as acting city clerk, does not have to take an oath and does not have to be a notary public and therefore is not authorized by law to administer oaths.
