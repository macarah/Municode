In the case of penalties arising from the failure of the taxpayer to comply with the terms, conditions, or covenants required with respect to properties receiving any type of preferential assessment, the Tax Commissioner of Lumpkin County shall not be authorized to waive any portion of the penalty that represents a recovery by the taxing authorities of any amount by which taxes were reduced as a result of the granting of such preferential assessment.
The Tax Commissioner of Lumpkin County has the sole discretion regarding the administration of the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-5-242 and any guidelines which may be established by this board when grating the waivers.
