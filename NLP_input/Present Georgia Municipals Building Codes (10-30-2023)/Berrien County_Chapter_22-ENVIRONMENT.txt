Sec. 22-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plants. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities, and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMP'S.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of singlefamily homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following;
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runnoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or contructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culvert except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in 22-34 (b)(2) of this article;
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted with a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
(i)
Stream crossings for water lines; or
(ii)
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
(i)
Stream crossings for water lines; or
(ii)
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. of 6-14-2004, § IV)
Sec. 22-35. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity with the jurisdictional boundaries of Berrien County without first obtaining a permit from Berrien County to perform such activity.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Berrien County Board of Commissioners and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 22-35 (c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
(3)
A fee, in the amount of $80.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
(4)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 (9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(5)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and variances required by section 22-34 (c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per section 22-35 (b)(5)b., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
(6)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(7)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
(c)
Plan requirements.
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws.

(b)
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Water Resource Districts," which is included as part of this article by reference, which is on file with the office of the county manager and/or his designee located in the county administration building.
(Ord. of 11-27-2000, § 1-2)
Sec. 22-142. - Groundwater recharge area district.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' (DNR) Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition), and the state department of natural resources' Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Standards for this district shall comply with DNR Rule 391-3-16-02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas.
(d)
Standards for permitted uses. The following are requirements for specific uses in the groundwater recharge area protection district:
(1)
All aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 660 gallons shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
a.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and
c.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resources conservation service.
(3)
New homes served by a septic tank/drainfield system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of table MT-1 of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (referred to in this section as the DHR manual). The minimums set forth in table MT-1 of the DHR manual may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A through F) of the DHR manual.
a.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area.
b.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area.
c.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(4)
New mobile (manufactured) home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual. The minimums set forth in table MT-2 of the DHR manual may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A through F) of the DHR manual.
a.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area.
b.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area.
c.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(5)
Lots of record approved prior to November 27, 2000 are hereby exempted from the requirements of subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section.
(6)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management and subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section.
(7)
New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks, and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements.

Sec. 22-143. - Alapaha River Corridor protection district.
(a)
Description of district.
(1)
The limits of the Alapaha River Corridor protection district are hereby defined to be all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Alapaha River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the buffer area, the area between the top of the river bank and the water's edge shall be included in the district.
(2)
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the river bank on-site, and ensure its proper delineation on the site plan. The required 100-foot buffer will be clearly delineated on the plat and enforced as a part of the local inspections process.
(3)
The Alapaha River Corridor protection district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the district, this section establishes performance standards winch apply to development within the district.
(b)
Intent. The intent of the regulations within this river corridor protection district is to limit the use of the Alapaha River Corridor, in conjunction with other governmental entities along the Alapaha River Corridor, in order to:
(1)
Ensure that the section of the river in the county will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water.
(2)
Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river.
(3)
Preserve those qualities that make the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife.
(4)
Help control erosion and absorb floodwater.
(5)
Protect and safeguard the health and welfare of all the citizens of the county and adjacent counties by providing protection of the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water.
(c)
Conditions and performance standards. Within the river corridor protection district, the conditions and performance standards set forth in this section shall apply.

Sec. 22-144. - Wetlands district.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The wetlands in the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control: flood control, erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(c)
District established.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps.
(2)
This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(3)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Permit required. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the county manager and/or his designee using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(e)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided in this section. The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
(f)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.

Sec. 22-171. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer and buffer zone mean the area of land adjacent to a river corridor or riverine wetland which serves to protect the area from adverse impacts or serves as an integral component of the river corridor or riverine wetlands ecosystem.
County means the board of commissioners or the county.
DNR means the state department of natural resources.
Local government means any city or county or other governmental authority which has jurisdiction and functions similar to that of a city or county.
Person means any individual, group of individuals, association, firm, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, organization, or legal entity of any kind, including municipal corporations, government agencies, or subdivisions thereof.

River corridor includes the widest floodplains of the respective streams plus adjacent buffer zones, as measured from the United States Geological Survey topographical maps, where any of various activities may damage the floodplains or streams. River corridor is defined for the various streams as follows:
(1)
River corridor, for all streams and watercourses of the county except the Alapaha River and the Withlacoochee River, means all land in the area of a stream or watercourse and being within 2,000 feet of the center of the stream or watercourse, or being hydraulically connected to the stream or watercourse and classified as wetland on the most current United States Soil Conservation Service maps, whichever is greater in areal extent for that section of the stream or watercourse.
(2)
River corridor, for the Withlacoochee River, means all land in the area of the river and being within 4,000 feet of the center of the river or being hydraulically connected to the river and classified as wetland on the most current United States Soil Conservation Service maps, whichever is greater in areal extent for that section of the river.

Sec. 22-172. - Policy and purpose.
(a)
The State of Georgia is one of the leading states in wetland resources, more particularly South Georgia. The river corridors and riverine wetlands of the county and the state are indispensable for the maintenance of the county's and the state's water quality, protection, adequate water resources, and game and fish habitat. However, river corridors and riverine wetlands are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil bearing capacity limitations, and other natural and human-induced hazards. In their natural state, they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife (fish, waterfowl, bird and fur-bearer) habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost, despoiled, or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, polluting, and other acts. Other river corridor and riverine wetland areas are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled, or impaired by such acts. The continued loss of river corridors and riverine wetlands threatens water quality and the public welfare.
(b)
It is the policy of the county to:
(1)
Establish a coordinated and cooperative program to protect, enhance, and restore river corridors and riverine wetlands, including, but not limited to, the following:
a.
Establishment of a river corridor and riverine wetland protection policy for all public and private lands and waters throughout the county;
b.
Formation of management guidelines for activities within the river corridor and riverine wetland areas;
c.
Implementation of such a policy and guidelines through regulations and coordinated actions by the county and its local governments, including seeking cooperation from the state and federal governments and their agencies; and
d.
Encouragement of government and private protection and restoration efforts for river corridors and riverine wetlands.
(2)
Require that activities not requiring a river corridor or riverine wetland location be located at upland sites and that practicable alternatives to water-dependent activities be applied.
(3)
Ensure the activities which do require a river corridor or riverine wetland location be restricted as follows:
a.
Such activities shall not block flood flows or destroy flood storage, shall not increase erosion, shall not destroy natural erosion controls, and shall not unnecessarily destroy wetlands.
b.
Such activities shall not cause or exacerbate water pollution by or through any of the following:
1.
Direct or indirect discharge of pollutants or environmental contaminants;
2.
The location of domestic, commercial or industrial waste disposal systems on unsuitable soils;
3.
Dredging;
4.
Unauthorized application of pesticides, herbicides, and algicides;
5.
Disposal of solid wastes at inappropriate sites;
6.
Creation of unstabilized fills; or
7.
The destruction of river corridor or riverine wetland vegetation which is important to erosion and pollution control.
c.
Such activities shall not cause nuisances or threaten safety due to the location of structures in flood or erosion areas or on soils with inadequate structural bearing capacity.
d.
Such activities shall not violate other local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(4)
Control activities in river corridors and riverine wetlands to protect and preserve their natural functions as listed in subsection (a) of this section.
(c)
The activities which unavoidably require hydrologic or habitat modification of river corridor and riverine wetland areas provide for mitigation of, reservation of, or compensation of environmental quality and habitat losses. Such restitution to the county and its citizens shall include, but shall not be limited to, minimizing impacts through proper design and controls and restoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed resources.
