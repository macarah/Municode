Sec. 402A. - Certificate of zoning compliance.
A.
To determine whether a structure or use existing or proposed for any property located within Spalding County is or may be used or developed in compliance with this ordinance, the owner of the property or his agent may request a certificate of zoning compliance from the zoning administrator. Such request shall be in writing and on such forms as may be developed for such purpose, which shall minimally meet the following standards:

(Res. of 8-5-97, § 1)
Sec. 403. - Continuance of non-conforming uses.
Invariably, at the time a land use and development control ordinance is adopted or amended, certain uses which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the regulations and standards for the districts in which they are located. These are known as non-conforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of non-conforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section:
A.
Where a non-conforming use of a building or lot has ceased for more than twelve (12) consecutive months and any part of that twelve-month period occurs after the adoption of this ordinance or where a nonconforming use has changed to a permitted or conforming use, further use of the building or lot shall be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located.
B.
A non-conforming use shall not be extended or altered unless the extension or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance.
C.
A non-conforming use which is altered or extended shall meet applicable Spalding County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming use, the building official and the administrative officer will inspect the unit and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the unit into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the unit meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he will issue the building permit for the non-conforming use.
D.
A non-conforming structure may be repaired, maintained and, in case of destruction, replaced, so long as any such repair, maintenance or replacement does not in any way increase its nonconformity, and it remains otherwise lawful.
Sec. 404. - Height of fences and walls in a residential zoning district.
A.
No fence shall exceed six (6) feet in height above the adjoining ground level. No fence located in a front yard (as defined in section 202.VVV) shall exceed four (4) feet in height above the ground level on property zoned AR-1, AR-2, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, C-1, C-1A, PDD, VN, AAR, PRRRD and O&I.
B.
No fence shall encroach into the public right-of-way.
C.
Barbed wire or other sharp, pointed fence material shall be allowed on property zoned AR-1 and AR-2 for purpose of livestock constraint.
D.
Barbed wire or other sharp, pointed fence material shall be allowed on property zoned C-1B, C-1C, C-2 and C-3.
(Res. No. A-09-04, §§ 1, 2, 3-16-09)
Sec. 405. - Required buffers in commercial and industrial districts.
In any commercial or industrial zoning district where a lot abuts any residential district or any adjacent residential use, a twenty-five-foot wide buffer shall be provided with screening as specified in section 407. Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision.
Sec. 406. - Screening of service areas within one hundred feet of public street.
Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within one hundred (100) feet of said street shall be provided with screening as specified in section 407, if within any commercial or manufacturing district.
Sec. 407. - Screening required.
Whenever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such fences and/or walls shall be at least six (6) feet in height, but no greater than eight (8) feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used (together with the fence prescribed) to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three (3) feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of said plantings and/or hedge plantings. Hedges of comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six (6) feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than two (2) years from the time of planting. At the time of the application for a building permit, the applicant shall post a performance bond in the amount sufficient to cover the cost of installation of the required screening. If at the end of the two-year period the buffered screening is satisfactorily in place as prescribed in this section, the amount of the bond shall be returned to the applicant; however, if the required screening is not completed satisfactorily as set forth in this section by the end of the two-year period, the bond shall be deemed forfeited and the required screening will be installed by Spalding County, using the funds from the proceeds of the cash bond posted by the applicant. At the time of the application for a building permit, the applicant shall grant an easement with Spalding County on and over the land site for which application has been made, sufficient to allow Spalding County to enter onto the property and perform the required screening work. Said easement onto the land shall be recorded in the Spalding County Superior Court clerk's office and remain on record at least until the screening is deemed to meet the requirements of this section 407. The administrative officer shall make determination of the degree of satisfactory completion of required screening according to a common standard; the administrative officer's decisions in each instance may be appealed to the board of appeals. When a favorable determination that requirements have been completed is made by the administrative officer, the county will execute a quitclaim or other conveyance of interest revoking the easement to the land owner of record.
Sec. 408. - Building permit required.
A.
The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the building official for a building permit:
1.
Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building.
2.
Erection, movement or demolition of a building, greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet gross floor area.
3.
Enlargement or other work on an existing building where it is determined by the building official that inspection of the work is necessary. The building official shall maintain a list of work that requires a permit within his office.
4.

The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the building official. He should complete the application form and submit it to the building official, together with any supporting documentation which the building official may specify.
E.
No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the building official to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the building official will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the building official that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
F.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the building official will then accept the application for building permit.
G.
Before a building permit is issued by the building official, the Spalding County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this ordinance. The county health department will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application from the administrative officer, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision.
H.
Except as otherwise provided by this ordinance, an existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable uniform development ordinances and standards as adopted by the county. Information about applicable development ordinances and standards may be obtained from the building official.
I.
The building official is in charge of issuing building permits. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application, the building official is satisfied that the proposed project can meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances. The building official may require the submission of additional information in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this ordinance.
J.
If the building official determines that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the building official to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit.
K.
Work or construction authorized by a permit must commence within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of issuance. The building official may grant an extension of time in which to commence work or construction for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days, upon written request and a showing of justifiable cause. Any extension granted by the building official shall be documented in writing. In the event work is not commenced within the time authorized, the permit shall be void. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project has been completed, construction must restart within twelve (12) months from the time that it was stopped or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of the building permits, applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the building official.
L.
All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in Spalding County. The building official will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes.
M.
The building official may revoke any building permit where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact or condition in the application or plans on which the permit was based, and upon such revocation, all construction, improvements or alterations as authorized by such permit or approval, shall cease until a valid building permit is issued.
N.
The demolition and removal of a building as defined herein shall require a demolition permit. Such permit shall be valid for a period of ninety (90) days.

Sec. 409. - Certificate of occupancy required.
A.
Certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued or where a change in use of the building has occurred may be occupied or used. The certificate of occupancy must be signed by the administrative officer and attest that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this ordinance have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this ordinance.
B.
The administrative officer will issue the certificate of occupancy upon notification by the building official that all applicable building codes and other uniform development standards and ordinances have been met. However, if the building official finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of occupancy. The administrative officer will notify the owner/contractor within ten (10) days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy.
C.
Certificate of completion may be issued by the building official to construction projects where the building of the structure is complete, but interior alteration or build-out may be proposed prior to occupancy. A structure or a portion of a structure receiving a certificate of completion shall not be occupied until the certificate of occupancy for the same is issued.
D.
Notice of approval may be issued by the building official to confirm that a particular system (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.) has passed the prescribed inspections and tests necessary for the operation of such system.
E.
A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the administrative official for a period not exceeding six (6) months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided that such temporary certificate shall include such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.

Sec. 410. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer or building official.
A.
If the administrative officer or building official executes an action which the aggrieved party believes to be contrary to this ordinance, that action may be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer or building official was taken.
B.
The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer or building official related to this ordinance. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration.
C.
When an action of the administrative officer or building official is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the building official may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the building official may certify to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless the construction is halted by the board of appeals or a restraining order is granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
D.
When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer or building official is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Spalding County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of appeals by certified mail with return receipt requested and postmarked at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
E.
The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Any person aggrieved by a decision by the board of appeals may petition the Spalding County Superior Court for a writ of certiorari.
Sec. 411. - Variances.
A.
A variance is a permit, issued by the board of appeals, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that varies from the requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual, specific case under such circumstances as will not be contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in practical difficulty (as distinguished from mere inconvenience) or unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
A variance may not be granted for the use of a parcel, building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance.
A variance may not be granted based on circumstances created by the applicant, such as:
1.
The purchase of a parcel with knowledge of an existing restriction;
2.
A claim of hardship based on prospective sales; or
3.
An expressed economic need, when such need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance.
The board of appeals shall, in granting a variance, determine that:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular parcel because of its size, shape, location and topography;
2.
Application of this ordinance to the particular parcel would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship on the property owner;
3.
Such conditions are peculiar and unique to the particular parcel;
4.
The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this ordinance;
5.
A literal interpretation of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any rights that others owning property within the same zoning classification are allowed;
6.
The variance, if granted, shall not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties within the same zoning classification;
7.
The variance may be granted with such conditions imposed as may be necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare and general value of the property in the general neighborhood; and
8.
Granting the variance shall not be based on consideration of any existing nonconforming uses on nearby parcels and no permitted use of any parcel in any other zoning classification.
B.
Relief from the hardship—the variance—must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this ordinance.
C.
When a variance is issued, the spirit of this ordinance must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. (For example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in an R-1 district under a variance).
D.
The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the board of appeals, except that in consideration of a rezoning of property from one zoning district to another, the board of commissioners may approve a variance in connection with its approval of a conditional rezoning.
E.
Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
F.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the administrative officer will then accept the application for variance.
G.
When an application for a variance is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Spalding County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. Mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file.
H.
The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
I.
The board of appeals may impose any other conditions which must be complied with by the applicant to compensate for the requirements varied from.
J.
The board of appeals may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six (6) months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the Variance expires after six (6) months.
K.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals on an application for a variance may petition the Spalding County superior court for a writ of certiorari.

Sec. 412. - Reserved.
Sec. 413. - Special exceptions.
A.
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the board of commissioners, following preliminary review by the board of appeals. These uses are identified in this ordinance as special exceptions and in each case carry specific circumstances under which the use should or should not be allowed.
B.
The developer or owner wishing to request a special exception must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a special exception. However, the power to approve a special exception rests with the board of commissioners.
C.
Application for a special exception may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for special exception or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
D.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either 1. or 2. above [sic], the administrative officer will then accept the application for special exception.
E.
When an application for a special exception is received, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "SPECIAL EXCEPTION NOTICE." It must show the proposed special exception use, date, time and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
F.
All applications for a special exception must first be reviewed by the board of appeals. The board of appeals will study the proposed special exception and determine if it meets the requirements of this ordinance, as well as other applicable ordinances of Spalding County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed special exception and make written recommendations to the board of appeals.
G.
The board of appeals will consider the following points in arriving at a recommendation on the special exception:
1.
It must not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties, or to the general neighborhood; it must not adversely affect the health or safety of residents or workers.
2.
It must not be that any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties are greater than the benefits or need for the special exception.
3.
It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use.
4.
It must meet all other requirements of this ordinance.
G 1 .
In addition to the criteria set forth in the preceding subsection, the board of appeals shall (for any application for the placement and location of a class A manufactured home in the agricultural-residential AR-1 zoning district, as allowed in section 503(B)(18) of this ordinance) determine that the location and placement thereof is compatible with the surrounding development in the general area, based on such information as necessarily determines that the manufactured home conforms with the general area in which it is to be placed based on the size of the dwelling, the site plan for the location of the dwelling, photographs and/or renderings of the front exterior thereof, roof material, exterior construction material, foundation material, general aesthetic appearance to conventionally constructed (site-built) housing and construction costs of conventionally constructed (site-built) housing pursuant to consideration of the following criteria:

2.
The administrative officer shall review the request for amendment of the official map to determine whether it is consistent with and complies with the requirements of the future land use map contained within the Spalding County Comprehensive Plan.
3.
In the event the request for amendment of the official map does not so comply, the developer or owner shall be required to file a separate request for amendment to the future land use map. The application for amendment to the future land use map shall be considered simultaneously with the request for an amendment to the official map pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 414(E)—(j) of this ordinance, provided however, that the request for amendment to the future land use map shall be approved prior to consideration the amendment to the official map.
The planning commission or the board of commissioners may also propose an amendment. However, any proposed amendment to the official map shall comply with the provisions of subsection A.3. The power to approve and enact an amendment to the future land use map and an amendment to the official map rests within the legislative discretion of the board of commissioners.
B.
Application for an amendment may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person regarding any property that is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If the property which is the subject of an amendment or any other action of the planning commission, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
C.
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, the administrative officer will then accept the application for amendment.
D.
When an amendment is initiated which involves changing the zoning district of a parcel of land, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "ZONING NOTICE". It must show the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, the purpose, date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer.
E.
All applications for amendment must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of this ordinance, as well as other applicable ordinances of Spalding County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission.
F.
The planning commission will, when considering a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance, first determine whether the limitation imposed by such an amendment, if any, on the right to unrestricted use of property which might result from the proposed amendment is necessary to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. In considering whether to recommend a change in the zoning classification of any particular property the planning commission will balance the benefit to the public of the present zoning classification of the property against the detriment to the property owner, and scrutinize the application in light of the character of the land in question and the effect of the zoning decision upon the property owner's rights. In making these determinations, the planning commission may consider the following:
1.
The existing uses and zoning of nearby property.
2.
The suitability of the property for the proposed purpose.
3.
The length of time the property has been vacant.
4.
The threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if rezoned.
5.
The extent to which the value of the property is diminished by the present zoning.
6.
The balance between the hardship on the property owner and the benefit to the public in not rezoning.
G.
The planning commission may also consider whether development of the property in the zoning classification sought would do any of the following:
1.
Have an adverse effect on the insurance rating of the county, or any substantial portion of the county, issued by the insurance service office or similar rating agency.
2.
Overtax any streets presently existing to serve the site, or other public facilities and utilities.

The location of the property, present zoning classification and proposed zoning classification must be indicated in the newspaper notice. Additionally, notice of the hearing shall be provided by United States mail to the owners of each and every parcel abutting the property which is the subject of the proposed amendment; such notice shall be deemed delivered upon mailing. The unofficial public hearing before the planning commission may be continued one (1) time at the request of the applicant.
I.
The planning commission will make a written record of its findings along with its recommendations on the proposed amendment and forward a copy of its findings and recommendations to the board of commissioners within sixty (60) days of the date on which the proposed amendment was received by the administrative officer. If the planning commission fails to send its findings and recommendations to the board of commissioners within the aforesaid sixty (60) days, it will mean that the planning commission approves the amendment.
J.
1.
The board of commissioners must then conduct a public hearing on the amendment.
