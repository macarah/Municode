ARTICLE IV. - ACCESS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR ROADS

Sec. 32-136. - Road frontage and access.
(a)
Subdivision frontage. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this section, each new subdivision created pursuant to this chapter shall have a minimum of 120 feet of frontage on a public road, or if approved pursuant to this chapter for gated communities, a private road.
(b)
Lot frontage. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this section, each new lot created pursuant to this chapter shall have a minimum of 60 feet of lot frontage on a public road, or, if approved pursuant to this chapter for gated communities, a private road. In the case of a lot fronting on and accessed by a cul-de-sac or other turnaround, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 35 feet.
(c)
Lot access to road. Each lot shall have the opportunity to have access to the public road along which the lot fronts, subject to applicable state or city standards for driveways and drainpipes; provided, however, that provision for access to the public road abutting the lot shall not require the lot owner to use the public road for access if access to such public road is otherwise not permitted by this chapter, or where shared access easements and driveways provide safe and acceptable alternative access to each lot. In the case of a gated community, each lot shall have access to a private road on which the lot fronts.
(d)
Requirements for new roads. New roads internal to a subdivision shall be city public roads meeting the specifications of this chapter; except that in the case of a gated community, private roads shall be permitted so long as they meet public road specifications. Roads interior to subdivisions, public or private, shall be paved with adequate right-of-way and meet all specifications of this chapter.
(e)
Lot access along state highways. A minor subdivision (up to five lots) may be approved by the administrative officer where each lot fronts a minimum of 60 feet on and has access to/from a state highway; provided, however, that shared access driveways are encouraged and permitted subject to approval of the Georgia Department of Transportation to eliminate the number of driveways on accessing a state highway. Major subdivisions of six or more lots designed to have two or more lots fronting on a state highway shall not be permitted, but one lot within a major subdivision may have access to/from the state highway.
(f)
Lot access to paved city or county roads. A minor subdivision (up to five lots) may be approved by the administrative officer where each lot fronts a minimum of 60 feet on and has access to/from a paved city or county public road. A major subdivision may be approved where up to six lots front a minimum of 60 feet and have access to/from a paved city or county public road. Where a major subdivision is proposed to have more than six lots fronting on and having access to a paved city or county public road, the city shall require the subdivider to reconfigure the subdivision design so that no more than one lot has access to the existing paved city or county public road.
(g)
Minor subdivision lot access to unpaved county roads. A minor subdivision (up to five lots) may be approved by the administrative officer where each lot fronts a minimum of 60 feet on and has access to/from an unpaved county public road.
(h)
Major subdivision access to unpaved county roads. A major subdivision (six or more lots) that proposes to use an unpaved city or county public road as the primary access to the subdivision shall only be approved by the planning commission if the subdivider agrees to pave that portion of the existing unpaved city or county public road fronting the subdivision to standards specified in this chapter. A major subdivision of 30 or more lots which proposes to use an unpaved county public road as the primary access to the subdivision shall only be approved if the subdivider agrees to pave and paves that portion of the existing unpaved city or county public road fronting the subdivision to standards specified in this chapter and, in addition, the subdivider agrees to pave and paves that portion of the existing unpaved city or county public road fronting the subdivision off-site to the point where the city or county public road intersects a paved city or county public road or state highway. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the city shall not approve a preliminary plat for a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development and occupancy of the subdivision.
(i)
Access by easement only. No subdivision shall be approved for purposes of residential, institutional, or commercial building sites where a lot has access only by way of an easement rather than a road as required by this section; provided, however, that this regulation shall not apply in the AG, agricultural zoning district.
(j)
Number of accesses to major subdivisions of 50 lots or more. When a subdivision consists of 50 or more lots, it is required that the subdivision have more than one entrance/exit to/from the subdivision. The city should consider the amount of existing county and/or city public road frontage and the configuration of the site in determining the number of entrances/exits required for preliminary plat approval.
(k)
Variances. Subject to the requirements and procedures of this chapter, the City Council may consider and approve, after application by the property owner and review by the planning commission, a variance to the provisions of this section in unusual circumstances where the road or access requirement would pose undue hardship. The burden of proof is on the applicant to prove undue hardship.

These funds shall be deposited in the appropriate road construction account prior to the approval of a final plat for a subdivision or prior to issuance of a development permit for a land development, or within 30 days of a city, county, or state award of a construction contract, whichever occurs first.
