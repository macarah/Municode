Section 10-A.1. - Findings and purposes.
The mayor and council find that the provisions of the present zoning ordinance do not adequately address the placement of towers and antennas within the jurisdictional limits of the city; that the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 allows the city to control the placement, construction and modification of communication towers; and that with the advent of enhanced technology the demand for personal communications services will cause an increased need for additional towers and transmission facilities within the jurisdictional limits of the city. The purpose of this ordinance is to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Calhoun, telecommunications providers, telecommunications customers, and developers of tower and antennas facilities in the siting of telecommunications facilities, towers and antennas within the City of Calhoun so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods by:
1.
Providing for the appropriate location and development of tower facilities in such locations, which promote public safety and the general welfare and serve the residents and businesses of the city;
2.
Minimizing, through proper siting, screening, and design the potential for visual blight and incompatibility and the proliferation of towers and antennas;
3.
Promoting tower safety through proper engineering and siting;
4.
Promoting and maximizing the shared use or collocation of new and existing towers;
5.
Encouraging the use of existing structures for antennas locations as an alternative to the development of additional single use towers; and
6.
Accommodating the increased demand for tower facility development.

Section 10-A.4. - Placement of towers in zoning districts.
Any person or entity desiring to obtain a building permit to construct and erect a tower within any zoning district in the City of Calhoun shall file a written application entitled "Application to Amend the Zoning Map of Calhoun, Georgia for Zoning Consideration" available at the Calhoun city hall and pay a fee as set and established from time to time by the mayor and council. The application shall state it is made to request a change of the then existing zoning where the applicant desires to place the tower to a zoning district to be designated as tower site as defined herein. The application will be reviewed and considered as a zoning decision and the procedures set forth in section 14.4 of this zoning ordinance of the City of Calhoun, Georgia, shall be applied and followed. In addition to those requirements contained elsewhere in this section X-A and the zoning ordinance of the City of Calhoun, Georgia, the zoning advisory board and the mayor and council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to approve or deny the rezoning request:
1.
Height of proposed tower or antenna;
2.
Proximity of the tower to residential structures, schools, day care centers, nursery schools, recreation areas, playgrounds, parks, hospitals and churches;
3.
Nature of uses of adjacent and nearby properties;

Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage;
5.
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing visual obtrusiveness;
6.
Proximity to other antennas or towers;
7.
Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers or other structures.
In approving the rezoning request the mayor and council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. Should the rezoning request be denied, the decision shall be in writing supported by substantial evidence as contained in a written record of the proceedings.
Section 10-A.5. - General requirements.
The location and construction of towers governed by this ordinance shall comply with the following requirements:
1.
Construction/inspections.
a.
Towers shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with applicable building codes, industry standards, and standards for towers published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall be responsible for periodic written inspections of such towers at least every 12 months to ensure structural integrity. Such inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer with a current license issued by the State of Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be submitted to the building inspector and shall be maintained by the tower owner(s) and available for public review upon request.
b.
If, upon inspection, the building inspector concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and poses a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice thereof to the owner, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. Should the owner fail to bring the tower into compliance within 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-12.
2.
Regulatory compliance. Tower owners shall annually certify in writing to the building inspector in January of each year that each tower is in compliance with standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner(s) of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such tower or antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency.
3.
Security. All towers, except alternative tower structures, shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an anti-climbing device.
4.
Advertising. Except for the owner's identifying nameplate, advertising on towers shall be prohibited. Sign control, as set forth in article X of the City of Calhoun Zoning Ordinance, shall apply to any issues regarding signage.
5.
Tower lighting. Illumination is prohibited on towers, except where required by the FCC or FAA, as necessary for air traffic safety. When illumination is required, documentation shall be provided with the application identifying the type of illumination required and any available alternatives. The mayor and council may review alternative permissible illumination and may approve the design causing the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
6.
Access. Access for maintenance vehicles shall be the right-of-way, which would most minimize interference with public traffic. Proposed sites which lack frontage on a public or private road shall provide an easement at least 20 feet wide with at least 12 feet graveled or paved travelway.
7.
Hazardous/volatile substances. Use of a lot by a tower shall be prohibited when another principal use, on the same lot, includes the storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such a propane, gasoline, natural gas, dangerous chemicals, or hazardous waste when such materials are not part of an emergency power source for the tower facilities.
8.
Maintenance/operation structures. Maintenance/operation structures adjacent to any tower facility area shall be used only to house equipment and other supplies directly in support of the tower. Such structures shall not be used for offices, vehicle storage or for any continuous human occupation. Any equipment not used in direct support of a tower site shall not be stored on the site.
9.
Historic sites. Tower facilities shall not be attached to or mounted to historically significant buildings, structures, or places identified by placement upon the National Register of Historic Places, by designation as a state historical site, by designation by the Gordon County Historical Society as a historic site, or as part of a locally designated historic district.
10.
Setbacks and separations. All towers shall comply with the following standards, except that existing alternative tower structures are exempt from the minimum setback and separation requirements of this section; provided however, that such alternative tower structure must be a conforming use within the zoning district in which it is located for this setback exemption to apply as a matter of right.
a.
All towers and antennas shall set back at least a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 15 feet, from any dwelling, zoning district line, or public property.
b.
All towers and maintenance/operation structures (including guy wires) shall comply with the setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located.
c.
The height limitations applicable to buildings in the zoning districts in which the tower or alternative tower structure is located shall not apply to such facilities or structures as a result of the tower or antenna.
11.
Buffers and screening.
a.
Tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from any public rights-of-way, public property, and any R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-2A, R-3, O-I and A-1 zoned property.
b.
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, this landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector.
c.
Existing mature growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited upon large, wooded lots, natural growth around the perimeter of the property may be sufficient if so determined by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector.
d.
In buffer construction, native vegetation shall be preserved to the fullest extent possible.
12.
Visual impact.
a.
Towers shall maintain a galvanized matte steel finish or be painted a natural, earth-toned color, unless otherwise required by the FAA.
b.
The design of buildings and structures at the base of the tower facility to site shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping which create the greatest level of compatibility with the natural environment and existing land use patterns.
c.
Antennas installed on an alternative tower structure and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a natural color that is similar to or complements the color of the alternative tower structure.
d.
Tower antennas shall be designed to be visually compatible with the exterior of the alternative tower structure to which they are to be attached.
Section 10-A.6. - Shared use/collocation.
New tower sites may not be permitted if there is an existing technically and commercially reasonable space available for shared use/collocation on preexisting towers and antennas or existing conforming towers and antennas.
1.
The application for a permit to develop a tower shall demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna.

Section 10-A.8. - Nuisances/abandoned towers.
1.
Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance.
2.
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal.
The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed, regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
3.
