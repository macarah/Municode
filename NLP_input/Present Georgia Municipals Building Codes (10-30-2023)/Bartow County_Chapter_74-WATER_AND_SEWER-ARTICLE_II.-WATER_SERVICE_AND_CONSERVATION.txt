(a)
All persons are prohibited from interfering with or disturbing in any manner or form, any water meters, switches, locks, cutoffs, corporation cocks or other appliances of the county, or to appropriate or use any water after service has been cut off or discontinued for the nonpayment of the charges therefore or for other cause. The head of household or property owner involved shall be held responsible for the violation of this section, in addition to any person observed tampering. Tampering fees of up to $500.00 shall be assessed where a meter has been disturbed, plus the fee for water used. The county reserves the right to remove a service where a meter has been tampered with and to refuse continued service to a property that has a history of violations of water service polices or ordinances.
(b)
Unauthorized operation of a county-owned hydrant will result in a tampering fee of up to $500.00, plus the fee for water used.
(c)
A customer's water meter may be turned off and tagged for any violation of Bartow County Water Department Rules and Regulations or Standard Operating Polices and Procedures, which are incorporated herein by reference.
(1)
If the tag is tampered with then a padlock will be applied and the customer must pay a $50.00-tampering fee before service can be restored. For each subsequent tampering with any tag by the same customer (whether on the same or different property), the fee shall double, to a maximum of $400.00 for the fourth and subsequent tag tampering violation.
(2)
If the padlock is removed or other means are used to gain water service, then the customer shall pay a $100.00 tampering fee plus the cost of any damage to the lock, meter or meter setter. The meter will be removed until all monies due are paid, including any overdue bills. For each subsequent tampering with any padlock by the same customer (whether on the same or different property), the fee shall double, to a maximum of $800.00 for the fourth and subsequent lock tampering violation.
(3)
If, after removal of the meter, an alternative means of obtaining water service is attempted (such as a "jumper" or other means), then the water service will be removed and future service will be considered as if the tampered service never existed. The property owner shall have to apply for and pay for new service, which may or may not be granted, and shall have to pay a fee of $1,000.00 prior to new service being granted.
(d)
The county reserves the right to refuse to provide service to any property that may not be in the best interest of the system, including property with a history of tampering with the meter (or other portions of the system). However, the county shall not refuse to supply water to any single or multifamily residential property to which water has been furnished through the use of a separate water meter for each residential unit on application of the owner or new resident tenant of the premises based solely on the indebtedness of a prior owner, prior occupant, or prior lessee for water previously furnished to such premises.
(e)
The county reserves the right to refuse to provide service to any individual or business customer that may not be in the best interest of the system, including customers with a history of tampering with the meter (or other portions of the system) on any property; customers with a history of non-payment of bills to the water department on any account on any property; or customers having any unpaid bill on any former water department account on the same or different property.

DIVISION 3. - WATER CONSERVATION

Sec. 74-56. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 8-2-1 through 8-2-3 is to impose water conservation restrictions; to provide definitions; to provide exemptions; to provide for penalties; to provide for related matters; to repeal any conflicting ordinances, and for other purposes.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(1), § 9)
Sec. 74-57. - Application.
The requirements of subsection 74-58(a) below shall apply to any residential construction initiated after January 1, 2003 and to any commercial construction initiated after January 1, 2003, which involves the repair or renovation of or addition to any existing building when such repair or renovation of or addition to such existing building includes replacement of toilet or showers or both.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(1), § 10)
Sec. 74-58. - Restrictions.
(a)
Construction restrictions. On or after January 1, 2003 no construction may be initiated within the county for any residential building of any type which:
(1)
Employs a gravity tank-type, flushometer-valve, or flushometer-tank toilet that uses more than an average of 1.6 gallons of water per flush;
(2)
Employs a showerhead that allows a flow of more than an average of 2.5 gallons of water per minute at 60 pounds per square inch of pressure;
(3)
Employs a urinal that uses more than an average of one gallon of water per flush;
(4)
Employs a lavatory faucet or lavatory replacement aerator that allows a flow of more than 2.2 gallons of water per minute; or
(5)
Employs a kitchen faucet or kitchen replacement aerator that allows a flow of more than 2.2 gallons of water per minute.
(b)
Irrigation systems. All new irrigation systems, both residential and nonresidential, shall have installed a rain sensor irrigation shut-off switch to prevent operation of the system during or within six hours after an adequate rain event. "Adequate rain event" shall mean at least one-half inch of rainfall.
(c)
Conservation. The county water and sewer department superintendent, with the concurrence of the commissioner, is authorized to implement special water conservation measures, on a case-by-case basis, during times of drought, low stream flows, interruptions in the raw water supply due to breaks or contamination; inability of the filter plants to meet demand; excessive losses or demands in the distribution system due to breaks, fires or other causes; restrictions imposed by suppliers or the state, contamination in the finished water; or any other purpose for which the curtailed use of water might be reasonably required in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare as determined by the commissioner. The water conservation measures may include restrictions or prohibitions on nonessential uses such as swimming pool filling; watering of lawns and gardens; washing of motor vehicles; recreational uses; and other uses which the superintendent may deem to be nonessential. The type, nature, degree, commencement and duration of restrictions or prohibitions shall be determined by the superintendent, with the concurrence of the commissioner. Notice of the restrictions or prohibitions shall be publicized in such a manner as to provide adequate notice to the water customer, including but not limited to inclusion on the customer's water bill. The violation of the restriction or prohibition shall be punished as recommended by the superintendent and approved by the commissioner.
(d)
Water conservation surcharge. Effective beginning November 1, 2007, to be reflected in the bills starting with the December 2007 billing cycle, a revised water conservation surcharge will be imposed to increase the rate on higher water usage. This conservation rate structure is required by the State of Georgia to encourage water conservation due to the severe water supply crisis. The charges for the water conservation surcharge are established as multiples of the Base Rate contained in the Bartow County Water and Sewer Rate Structure and Readiness to Serve Ordinance, 2005, as adopted December 7, 2005, and amended December 6, 2006. Tiers are in 1,000 gallon increments as billing is based on that increment.
Conservation Surcharge Water and Wastewater Rates
(by meter type and water volume)
EXPAND
Residential: Tier 1 (1,000 to 5,000 gallons) 100% of Base Rate
Tier 2 (6,000 to 8,000 gallons) 125% of Base Rate
Tier 3 (9,000 to 15,000 gallons) 150% of Base Rate
Tier 4 (16,000 gallons or more) 200% of Base Rate
Commercial: (per 1,000 gallons) 125% of Base Rate

Wastewater: (per 1,000 gallons of metered water use) 100% of Base Rate
  (e)
Emergency conservation measures. During any period when a state of emergency is declared by the governor or the commissioner regarding drought in the county, the county shall be subject to EPD Level 4 drought restrictions on outdoor watering, meaning no outdoor water use is permitted except under the exemptions of the Rules of the EPD, Chapter 391-3-30-.05. Pursuant to the authority of the Rules of the EPD, Chapter 391-3-30-.06, the following additional restrictions on outdoor watering use apply during any period when a state of emergency is declared:
(1)
Landscaping. New landscaping may only be watered for 15 days following installation. This exemption shall only apply to landscape installations performed by licensed landscapers. Homeowners and landscapers may water new landscape installations between the hours of midnight and 10:00 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Only newly installed vegetation may be watered. New home construction will have 15 days to water newly installed landscape, for the purposes of erosion and sedimentation control. A builder may choose to heavily mulch a property instead until water conditions improve. Only one new landscape exemption will be permitted per planting season as defined as September to March and April to August, per property. A new landscape exemption form with a receipt must be submitted to the water department to receive the exemption. Aeration and overseeding shall count as a new exemption.
(2)
Pressure washing. Pressure washing of parking lots is prohibited. Pressure washing of buildings and structures for beautification is prohibited. Pressure washing will be allowed for health and safety reasons. Pressure washing will be allowed when required prior to a procedure such as painting.
(3)
Fire hydrant meters. Use of portable meters associated with fire hydrants shall not be permitted, and any currently in use shall be returned and such use discontinued, except for meters required for public health and/or safety.
(4)
Emergency contracts. For public works construction contracts related to expansion or improvement of the water system that directly result from a drought-related state of emergency (including, but not limited to, contracts to connect to or develop new water supply sources), the commissioner has determined that the best interests of the county necessitate suspending the requirements contained in O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 for four weeks of advertisement for soliciting bids on such contracts. In the event the water supply situation reaches a critical stage, necessitating the extraordinary expense of an additional connection, a further four-week delay would endanger the public safety and welfare. Similarly, proceeding with an expensive expansion project prior to the absolute latest possible time risks wasting funds on an unnecessary connection. Furthermore, the suspension of such requirements is authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22. One day of advertisement of such contracts prior to opening bids shall be sufficient, for emergency projects related to expansion or improvement of the water system to cope with the drought. However, the contracts shall be subject to all other provisions of the Public Works Construction Law, except as necessitated by this change. Furthermore, the county shall wait to receive at least three bids on any proposed contract before opening bids (except in circumstances where, after one week, three bids are not received, due to lack of interest from contractors; or except in other dire emergency circumstances necessitating immediate action).
(f)
Restriction on outdoor watering of landscape. Other than in times of a state of emergency (discussed in subsection (e) above), outdoor watering for purposes of planting, growing, managing or maintaining ground cover, trees, shrubs, or other plants in the unincorporated area of the county may only occur between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m.; provided; however, that this limitation shall not create any limitation upon the following outdoor water uses (as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-7):
(1)
Commercial agricultural operations (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3);
(2)
Capture and reuse of cooling system condensate or stormwater in compliance with local ordinances and state guidelines;
(3)
Reuse of gray water in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5.2 and local board of health regulations adopted pursuant thereto;
(4)
Use of reclaimed waste water by a designated user from a system permitted by the Environmental Protection Division of the DNR to provide reclaimed waste water;
(5)
Irrigation of personal food gardens;
(6)
Irrigation of new and replanted plant, seed, or turf in landscapes, golf courses, or sports turf fields during installation and for a period of 30 days immediately following the date of installation;
(7)
Drip irrigation or irrigation using soaker hoses;
(8)
Handwatering with a hose with automatic cutoff or handheld container;
(9)
Use of water withdrawn from private water wells or surface water by an owner or operator of property if such well or surface water is on said property;
(10)
Irrigation of horticultural crops held for sale, resale, or installation;
(11)
Irrigation of athletic fields, golf courses, or public turf grass recreational areas;
(12)
Installation, maintenance, or calibration of irrigation systems; or
(13)
Hydroseeding.
(g)
Service leaks. Water leakage creates a serious waste of water. The county water system will leave a door hanger at any address where a leak is detected. Language will be added to let customers know that a leak must be repaired within 24 hours or water service may be terminated. For any leak exceeding 1.0 gallons per minute water service will be immediately terminated until the leak is repaired, and satisfactory evidence of the repair is presented to the water department. Where the water supply is cut off as herein provided, the water shall not again be turned on until all water bills and this bill for the cost of cutting off and again turning on the water service shall have been paid.
(h)
Waste of water. Recognizing the precious nature of the limited resource of water, it is declared the policy of Bartow County that willful waste of water is prohibited as set forth herein.
(1)
The following uses are a waste or unreasonable use or method of use of water and are prohibited:
a.
Operation of an irrigation system or other lawn or landscaping watering device during rain.
b.
Operation of an irrigation system or other lawn or landscaping watering device that has any broker or missing sprinkler heads that results in uncontrolled spraying of water.
c.
Failing to repair a controllable leak, including a broken sprinkler head, leaking valve, leaking outdoor faucet, service line leak or any other visible outside water leak on premises owned, leased, or managed by that person, within 30 days.
d.
The washing of vehicles, building exteriors, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios, or other paved areas without the use of a positive shut-off nozzle on the hose, which results in excessive run-off, except where necessary to dispose of liquids or substances that would endanger the public's health and safety.
e.
The excessive use, loss, or escape of water through breaks, leaks or malfunctions in the water user's plumbing or distribution facilities for any period of time after such escape of water should reasonably nave been discovered and corrected. It shall be presumed that a period of 24 hours after discovery is a reasonable time within which to correct such leak or break.
f.
The use of water for any purpose or in such a way that it flows, sprays, or is otherwise discharged upon any street, alley, or other public right-of-way, ditch or drain, or the watering of grass, lawns, groundcover, shrubbery, trees and open ground, in a manner or to an extent which allows water to run off the area being watered or onto an adjacent property.
(2)
The foregoing restrictions do not apply to the following authorized uses: firefighting, fire training, inspection and testing of fire suppression systems and fire hydrants; water applied as dust control measures as required by erosion and sedimentation control; water applied to abate spills of flammable or hazardous materials when water is the appropriate methodology; water applied to prevent or abate health, safety or accident hazards when alternate methods are not available; water used for construction and maintenance activity where the application of water is the appropriate methodology and where no other practical alternative exists; mobile car washes where permitted; emptying of swimming pools (which shall not authorize drainage onto neighboring property); water used in the operation, inspection and testing of municipal/community water systems.
(3)
The water department may issue immediate citations for wasteful water usage. For any wasteful usage exceeding 1.0 gallons per minute water service will be immediately terminated until the waste is immediately stopped. For lesser wastage, notice shall be given that water service may be cut off in 24 hours if the wastage is not halted. Where the water supply is cut off as herein provided, the water shall not again be turned on until all water bills and this bill for the cost of cutting off and again turning on the water service shall have been paid.
(i)
Enforcement. No person shall use or allow the use of water in violation of the restrictions on water use contained herein. Violations of this section shall be punishable pursuant to the provisions of section 74-106 et seq. and section 74-126 et seq. except that a fine may be assessed of up to $1,000.00 for any violation.

Contamination means any impairment of the quality of the county's potable water by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance, including but not limited to sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials, to a degree which degrades the quality of the potable water and creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
Cross-connection means any actual or potential physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. Alternatively, it is a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that might allow such substances (such as gasses, liquids, or solids) to enter the potable water system and to affect the water's taste, color or odor. This term includes, but is not limited to, any temporary connections, such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding multiport tubes.
Cross-connections, controlled means a cross-connection that has an approved backflow prevention device properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Cross-connection control by containment means any of the following:
(1)
At service connection: The installation of one approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control any or all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water system.
(2)
After service connection: The installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying all or a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's premises which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection.
Customer. Any owner of premises receiving county water system service or any end-user thereof, including any and all persons, natural or artificial, including any individual firm, association or trust and any municipal or private corporation organized or existing under the laws of this or any other state or country.
Department means the Bartow County Water System.

To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged.
Water, nonpotable means water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability.
Water, potable means any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption.
Water, used means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
Water purveyor means a supplier of water, including property owners supplying water for their own use.
Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system (i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system). If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. "Service connection" shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.
Water system means the county water system and the customer's water system, where not specifically limited as such. The department system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the department, up to the point where the customer's system begins (at and including the water meter and any required backflow prevention devices used in conjunction therewith). The source facilities shall include all components of the facilities used in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the department's distribution system which are used in conveying department-delivered domestic water to points of use.
