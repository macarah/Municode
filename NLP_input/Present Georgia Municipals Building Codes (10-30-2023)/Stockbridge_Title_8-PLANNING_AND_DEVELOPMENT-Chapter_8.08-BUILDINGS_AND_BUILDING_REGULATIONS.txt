N.
Conditions of Permit.
1.
A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the community development department from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the last scheduled and passed inspection. One (1) or more extensions of time, for periods not more than thirty (30) days each, may be granted by the building official. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions, if granted, shall be in writing.
2.
Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the city, are hazardous or complex, the community development department shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and, upon completion, make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official.

A.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety.
B.
The governing authority finds that within the city limits, there are buildings and structures that are vacant and pose a danger to the citizens of the city. Vacant structures are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire, accidents, looting and other unsafe activities that are injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. In addition, they can attract and/or cause blight and other harmful effects to surrounding properties.
C.
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners.
D.
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
E.
Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article.
F.
This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of this Code.

Unless specifically authorized in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself.
D.
Grading.

The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners.
2.
