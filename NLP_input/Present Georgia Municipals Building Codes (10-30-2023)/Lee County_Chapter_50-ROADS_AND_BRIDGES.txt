Sec. 50-32. - Authorized.
When the board of commissioners shall reasonably determine that any pipe, main, conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower, or other signal and equipment, facilities or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the county should be removed or relocated, because it has become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a county road, or will become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a contemplated county road, a written notice shall be directed to the utility company, giving at least 60 days' notice in which to make such change as is necessary for removal or relocation as may be necessary. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the commissioners may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from receipt of such final notice. If such removal has not begun, or if such removal has begun and the relocation has not been completed within a reasonable time, the board of commissioners may remove or relocate the equipment with its own employees, or by contracted labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation; and the expense shall be charged to the utility. The expense shall be certified to the county attorney, who shall have the authority to proceed with suit against the utility for payment if payment or arrangements to make payment are not made within 60 days.

The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
