(7)
As a prerequisite to the issuance of any license, the applicant shall furnish a complete set of fingerprints for all persons required to sign the application to be forwarded to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as specified under Georgia law. Each person required to sign the application for an original license and/or renewal license, must authorize the county or its designated representatives to secure from any state, county, municipality or federal court, any police department and/or law enforcement agency his, her or its criminal history and civil history and further authorize the county, its officers and employees to use such information in determining whether or not an alcoholic beverage license will be issued to the applicant. Further, the applicant must authorize the county, its officers and employees to use such information in a public hearing if necessary, to determine whether or not the applicant's license should be denied, voided, cancelled and/or revoked.

(10)
The building and planning director may require any additional information and records he reasonably deems necessary. Failure to furnish such data shall automatically serve to dismiss the application.

(11)
Each applicant shall certify that applicant has read this chapter and if the license is granted, each licensee shall maintain a copy of this chapter on the premises and shall require each of the licensee's employees to be familiar with this chapter.

In the event the failure to obtain fingerprinting information from state and federal authorities delays completion of the written report, the sheriff's office may later supplement any fingerprinting information.

Upon production of the criminal investigation report, the sheriff's office shall assemble the application forms and all accompanying documents relating to investigation and processing of the application and deliver such documents to the building and planning director for review. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant meets the requirements set by this chapter and the building and planning director believes that the applicant may meet all other qualifications of this chapter, then the building and planning director shall schedule the application for a hearing at the next regularly scheduled board of commissioners meeting and shall so inform the applicant of this fact before such meeting.

(c)
Any application which the building and planning director determines to satisfy all the qualifications outlined in this chapter, including character requirements as contained in the criminal investigation report of the sheriff, shall be scheduled for review at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners.

The board shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the application based on the information presented. A decision by the board of commissioners shall be made within 45 days from the date of the board of commissioners meeting unless the decision is postponed for purposes of the board obtaining additional information deemed necessary for consideration of the application. Notice of the decision by the board of commissioners shall be mailed to the applicant.

(f)
Upon the issuance of a license, the licensee must have and continually maintain in Habersham County, a registered agent upon whom any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter may be served. This person must be an individual and must be a resident of Habersham County, Georgia. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the building and planning director in such form as he or she may prescribe.
(g)
Upon approval by the board of commissioners of the application for a license, the building and planning director shall issue a license in accordance with the approved application. If the applicant is an individual, the license shall be issued in the name of the individual. If the applicant is a corporation, the license shall be issued in the name of the corporation and in the name of the officer or employee of the corporation primarily responsible for the operation of the licensed premises.

Sec. 6-143. - Nude dancing; findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; and Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Habersham County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.
(b)
The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcohol beverages for consumption on such premises within the unincorporated area of Habersham County:

(2)
Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (b)(1) above or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of or acts which simulate any of the following:
