Sec. 54-142. - General guidelines governing leave.
(a)
Employee responsibilities during leave. Any employee applying for leave under a specific leave provision must comply with the following:
(1)
Must follow appropriate procedures to request a leave and to return from a leave;
(2)
Must communicate regularly with the supervisor/manager regarding the status of their leave;
(3)
Must submit any required documentation related to their return to work;
(4)
Must maintain required payments for any insurance benefits to be continued during the leave.
(b)
Benefits during leave. A leave of absence prevents a break in service, but no benefits (such as sick leave, vacation leave, or holidays) will accrue during a leave of absence (except for military leave). Benefits such as medical insurance and retirement contributions will be suspended after 30 days unless the employee chooses to pay the required contribution. Eligibility for these benefits will be reinstated if the employee returns to work during or at the end of the approved leave period.
(c)
Duplicate use of benefits. Employees are not allowed to use two different types of paid leave benefits for the same day off. For example, if a holiday occurs while an employee is on vacation leave, the employee cannot receive both vacation leave pay and holiday pay for the day in question (in this example, the employee would receive holiday pay for the holiday, and his/her vacation leave benefits would not be reduced by the number of holiday hours occurring during the vacation). This rule applies to all types of leaves or benefits.
(d)
Anniversary date. In calculating accrual of benefits, accrual begins on the day of original appointment to an eligible position. If an employee takes a leave of absence, the anniversary date will be adjusted by as many calendar weeks as the employee is absent on leave of absence.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, ยง I-2)
Sec. 54-143. - Military leave.
Military leave will be granted to eligible employees (excluding temporary employees) in accordance with federal and state laws governing such leave.
(1)
Eligibility. Any regular employee who leaves county service to join the military forces of the United States during time of war or other national emergency, or is inducted by Selective Service, may, upon written request, prior to induction into the military, be placed on military leave without pay, such leave to extend through a date 90 days after which such service terminates.
Employees who are members of the National Guard or a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States and who are ordered to military duty or to military training may request and be granted military leave for the amount of time required to meet military obligations.
(2)
Procedure to request military leave. Employees should submit a written request for military leave as soon in advance as is reasonably practical. The request should include the reason for leave, requested date to commence leave, and date leave will end (or estimated return date, if length of military leave cannot be determined). Employees who are ordered by appropriate military authority to serve during an emergency and who provide the required documentation will be granted leave without pay for the duration of their obligated military duty.
(3)
Military training or reserve duty. Any regular employee who is a member of the National Guard or an organized military reserve of the United States will be allowed leave of absence with pay, not to exceed 18 calendar days (or in compliance with state law) during any calendar year to attend training camps, upon presentation of orders concerning such training. Such leave will not be charged to vacation leave.
(4)
Compensation during military leave. Military leave is an unpaid leave of absence. However, employees on military leave may choose to use available vacation leave during the absence.
(5)
Benefits during unpaid military leave. During unpaid military leave, the county continues to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the military leave, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of applicable benefit plans. However, benefit accruals such as vacation leave, sick leave, or holiday benefits are suspended, and will resume upon return to active employment. Employees who return to work at the end of a military leave are considered continuously employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service.
(6)
Return from military leave. The employee is entitled to return to the vacated position or a comparable position, provided the employee makes application to the county within 90 days of date of discharge under honorable conditions, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation. Failure to apply for reinstatement within the allotted time period constitutes waiver of these rights.
The returning employee is entitled to any increases in salary (including cost-of-living increases) or any advancement in grade which would normally be accorded to the incumbent of the position, with exception of any increases or advancement in grade which would normally be dependent on meritorious performance of position duties.
In the event a position vacated by a person entering the military service as stated above no longer exists at the time he or she qualifies to return to work, the person will be entitled to be re-employed in another position of the same status, class, and pay, provided such re-employment does not necessitate the laying off of another employee.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, ยง I-3)
Sec. 54-144. - Civil leave.
Stephens [County] Government encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities, such as jury duty, court appearances, or voting. Regular employees may be eligible for leave time with pay or without pay to perform required civic duties.
(1)
Jury duty. Upon receiving a summons to serve on jury duty, the employee should present a copy of the jury summons to his/her supervisor as soon as possible. When the jury is not meeting, the employee must report for work. The employee also is required to report to work before and/or after the daily tour of jury duty, as time and circumstances warrant. Employees will be paid their regular wages while serving jury duty, less any jury duty compensation paid by the court; employees will be required to submit to payroll a copy of the check stub received as payment for jury duty. In all cases, the employee must continually keep his/her supervisor informed of the employee's status.
(2)
Voting. Stephens County encourages employees to exercise their individual right to vote by participating in elections. Most employees should be able to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. Employees who are unable to vote in election during their nonworking hours will be allowed up to two hours of time off without pay. Time off for voting should be taken at the beginning or end of the regular workday, or as an extension of the employee's lunch/meal break. In addition, no employee will be given or refused employment, suspended, or discharged because of his/her vote or failure to vote in any election.
(3)
Court appearances. County employees who are subpoenaed or ordered to appear in court as a witness, or to testify in an official capacity on behalf of federal, state, or local government, may be granted leave with pay for such period as required by the court. However, this policy does not apply to litigation unrelated to the employee's position with the county. Any absence from work by an employee to appear in any capacity in private litigation not associated with his/her position with the county should be charged to vacation leave, or taken off without pay (with supervisory approval).
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, ยง I-4)
Sec. 54-145. - Family and medical leave.
Under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an employee may be granted up to 12 weeks of family and/or medical leave during any 12-month period. This leave is not intended to replace other authorized leaves.
To be eligible for family and medical leave under FMLA, an employee must be employed for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding commencement of the leave. After satisfying this criteria, an employee may take up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave per year as long as they work at least 1,250 hours in a rolling 12-month period (a rolling 12-month period is defined as a 12-month period measured backwards from the date an employee uses any family and medical leave). Family and medical leave may be taken intermittently in increments of two hours.
Leave is allowable under FMLA for the following events:
(1)
The birth, adoption, or foster care of a child (entitlement to leave for birth of a child, placement of a child for adoption, or foster care expires at the end of the 12-month period that began on the date of birth/placement of the child);
(2)
Care for an employee's child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition; or,
(3)
The serious health condition of an employee where the employee is unable to perform the essential function of his/her position.
Family leave may be paid or unpaid. Leave is paid when an employee uses sick or vacation leave for a condition that qualifies for this type of leave. For example, an employee can use sick and/or vacation leave for birth of a child, and the time taken will be counted toward the 12 weeks per year of family and medical leave. Once an employee exhausts available paid leave, any additional leave taken for family purposes will be without pay. During periods of unpaid leave, no sick or vacation leave benefits will accrue, nor will holiday pay provisions apply. The employee is required to pay his/her contribution for insurance premiums while on family and medical leave without pay.
Part-time employees are eligible for a pro-rata amount of family and medical leave, since this leave is based on a standard 40-hour workweek. The amount available for a part-time employee is calculated individually based on the amount of time worked during the year.
Spouses who are both employed by the county are entitled to a combined total of 12 weeks of family & medical leave within the 12-month period to care for a new child or sick parent. Each spouse may be entitled to additional FMLA leave for other FMLA qualifying reason (for example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care for a newborn child, each could later use an additional six weeks due to his/her own serious health condition or to care for a child with a serious health condition).
Procedures to request family and medical leave are as follows:
(1)
An employee must request family and medical leave at least 30 days before leave is to begin when the leave is foreseeable (such as an expected birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment of the employee or family member).
(2)
If 30 days' notice to request leave is not feasible due to medical emergency or change in circumstances, leave must be requested as soon as possible.
(3)
An employee must submit written request for leave by completing the designated form to request family and medical leave. In emergency situations where written notification is not possible, verbal notice will be accepted, to be followed by written request.
(4)
The written leave request must be signed by the employee's immediate supervisor and department manager, and then approved by the county administrator.
(5)
If the leave is due to the employee's own serious health condition or to care for a family member, the employee must obtain medical certification from a physician. This certification must be submitted with the written leave request within two business days of submitting the leave request, and must contain the following information:
a.
Name of the health care physician;
b.
The physician's type of medical practice or specialty;
c.
Medical facts that support the certification;
d.
Explanation of how the condition qualifies as a serious health condition under the family and medical leave provision;
e.
Date the serious condition began; and
f.
Duration of serious health condition and estimate of length of incapacitation.
(6)
The county may contact the physician to clarify any information given in the medical certification, but may not request information beyond that described above.
(7)
The county will notify the employee within two business days regarding approval of leave or requirement for additional information.
(8)
If there is any doubt as to validity of original certification, the county may require the employee to submit to 2nd certification by another physician (at county expense). The county may designate the physician, but not a physician regularly employed by the county. In the event of differing opinions given by the employee's physician and the county's physician, the county may require medical certification from a third physician (again at county expense). The third physician must be jointly approved by the employee and the county, and this third opinion will be final and binding.
(9)
The county may request recertification every 30 days for serious illness, or when the employee is under supervision of a health care provider.
(10)
The county may require an employee on family and medical leave to report periodically on his/her status and intent to return to work.
(11)
Failure of an employee to return to work on the agreed-upon date may result in termination of employment.
Procedures for an employee to return to work under family & medical leave are as follows:
(1)
The employee may be required to obtain and present certification from the health care provider confirming that the employee is able to resume working.
(2)
The employee will be returned to the former position or to a position of equal status, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.
(3)
Exceptions to restoration to an equivalent position when an employee returns are:
a.
The employee is no longer able to perform essential functions of the job.
b.
The employee is considered a "key employee" where denial of job restoration is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operation of the county.

Sec. 54-146. - Leave of absence without pay.
A personal leave of absence without pay may be granted to regular full-time employees who have at least six months of continuous service for situations that, in management's view, require such a leave. A regular full-time employee may be granted a leave of absence without pay for up to 12 months in accordance with terms of the respective type of leave, under the following conditions:
(1)
The employee must submit written request for leave of absence without pay to the immediate supervisor or department head, as early as possible before commencement of proposed leave.
(2)
Leave without pay may only be granted after the employee's accrued vacation leave has been exhausted.
(3)
The leave must be for a justifiable reason.
The supervisor and department head will make recommendation regarding the request, and will forward the request for leave without pay to the county administrator. The county administrator will forward the request along with a recommendation to the board of commissioners for approval.
Approval will be at the discretion of the board of commissioners. The leave must not cause undue hardship on the county, and must not impair the proper functioning of the county or its programs or services. Approval may be granted based on the circumstances surrounding the request, including the reasons for leave, the requested duration, anticipated workload during the requested leave time, and staffing considerations.
If approved, a leave of absence without pay may not exceed 12 months, unless extended by the board of commissioners. Failure to report for duty promptly at the end of the leave may be cause for termination of employment.
Benefit accruals such as vacation leave, sick leave, or holidays will be suspended during a leave of absence without pay.
Employees are responsible for paying the full costs of applicable insurance premiums while on leave without pay (this includes both the employee's share and the county's share of benefits).
While on leave of absence from Stephens County, no employee will be allowed to accept other employment. If an employee on a leave of absence accepts employment with another employer, the leave of absence is cancelled and employment with Stephens County will be terminated (except for employees working for a government agency during military leave).
If necessary for effective operation of Stephens County government, an employee granted leave without pay may be required to return to work before expiration of their leave. An employee who does not return at the required time is considered to have resigned and may be terminated.
When the leave of absence expires, every effort will be made to reinstate the employee to the position, pay grade, and benefit status held at the time leave was granted. If such position has been filled, the employee may be offered an available comparable position for which the employee is qualified. If no such comparable position is available, the employee will be given preference in the event of an appropriate opening.

Sec. 54-147. - Educational leave of absence.
An Educational leave of absence without pay may be granted to regular full-time employees in accordance with the provisions set forth for leave of absence without pay. The request must be submitted in writing to the supervisor or department head, and forwarded to the county administrator. The county administrator will forward the request along with a recommendation to the board of commissioners for approval. (Refer to the "Leave of Absence Without Pay" section above for details).
An employee returning from approved educational leave of absence will be entitled to all rights and benefits they might have received had their service not been interrupted. Also the returning employee may be appointed or promoted to a higher level position at the discretion of the department head, provided the employee meets the qualifications of the new position.
