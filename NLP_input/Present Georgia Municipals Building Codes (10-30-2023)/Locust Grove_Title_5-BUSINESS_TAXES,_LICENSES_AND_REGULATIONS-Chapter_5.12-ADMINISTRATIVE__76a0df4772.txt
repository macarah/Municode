B.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on April 1st of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date.
C.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be refunded by city to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to be conducted in the city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by said business for the current year.

5.12.210 - Revocation.
Failure of any person to pay an applicable administrative fee, regulatory fee or occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent or upon failure to permit inspection of books as required, shall result in any business tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate granted by the city under this chapter permitting such person to do business in the city for the current year being automatically revoked without any further action required of the city. No new occupation certificate or regulatory fee certificate shall be granted by the city for the occupation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax or fees herein required are unpaid nor shall such certificates be issued to a person who has failed to submit adequate records for inspection as required by Section 5.12.200.
