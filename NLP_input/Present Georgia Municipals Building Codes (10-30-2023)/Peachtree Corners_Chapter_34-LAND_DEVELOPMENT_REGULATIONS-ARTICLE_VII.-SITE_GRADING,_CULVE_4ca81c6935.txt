Sec. 34-187. - Site grading.
(a)
Compliance with line and grade required. Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the approved grading plan.
(b)
Contour interval of two feet required. Grading plans shall show existing and proposed contour lines at an interval of no more than two feet. Grading plans shall outline the areas that are required to remain undisturbed (i.e., tree protection areas, buffer, etc.) and shall indicate protective fencing or staking to be placed surrounding such areas.
(c)
Consistent with Metropolitan River Protection Act. If the property is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, the grading shall be consistent with the River Corridor Certificate approved for the project.
(d)
Embankment layering. Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structure, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent.
(e)
Maximum slopes.
(1)
The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2 to 1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall), except:
a.
For earthen dam embankments;
b.
For rock cuts;
c.
Where certified by a professional engineer; or
d.
As discussed in subsection (f) of this section.
(2)
Earthen dam embankments shall be 3 to 1 maximum unless a modification application is approved. The intent of the earthen dam embankment slope regulation is to provide for public safety, soil stability, and dam maintenance considerations. The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill that shall be allowed to occur in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill unless benching is approved by the city. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the director. (Note: No blasting shall occur unless a permit has been obtained from the fire marshal's office.) Refer to the standard drawings for grading section and retaining wall details.
(f)
Special conditions for soil with low shearing resistance and cohesion. While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2 to 1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2 to 1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3 to 1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height, and integrity.
(g)
Grading plan for building pad locations for residential subdivisions. A grading plan showing building pad locations shall be submitted for residential subdivisions, unless a modification application is approved, zoned for a lot size of less than 12,000 square feet or a density of four units per acre or more. The intent of this regulation is to ensure adequate lot-to-lot drainage. Granting a modification will not nullify the intent of these regulations when the layout has a minimum lot area of 14,520 square feet and a minimum lot width of 90 feet. The grading plan may be used as a construction document prior to approval of the final plat or as a guidance document for individual lot grading after approval of the final plat.
(h)
Grading for roads and ditches. Grading for roads and improved ditches shall be shown.
(Ord. No. 2013-01-02, art. 8, § 8.1, 1-29-2013)
Sec. 34-188. - Culverts and piped drainage systems.
(a)
Drainage improvements required. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, storm drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, and ditches, shall be provided for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the requirements of these regulations.
(b)
Design criteria; general.
(1)
All stormwater conveyance facility design calculations shall be certified by the authorized registered professional (refer to section 34-187(a)(1)).
(2)
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the city stormwater systems and facilities installation standards and specifications.
(3)
The USGS Method shall be used, where applicable, to check the magnitude of peak flows when other hydrologic methods recommended in the manual are used.
(4)
All portions of a stormwater conveyance system which drain areas falling within the same size category above shall be analyzed using the same methodology.
(5)
Runoff coefficients used for the Rational Method and runoff curve numbers used for the SCS Method shall be consistent with those shown in the city stormwater systems and facilities installation standards and specifications.
(c)
Design criteria; culverts.
(1)
Culvert design is to be in accordance with the methods contained in the city stormwater systems and facilities installation standards and specifications and shall include a thorough analysis of both inlet and outlet control conditions.
(2)
The 100-year ponding limits at and upstream of the culvert shall be shown on the development plans and on the final plat, if applicable.
(Ord. No. 2013-01-02, art. 8, § 8.3, 1-29-2013; Ord. No. 2020-10-181, 11-17-2020)
Note— Formerly § 34-189. See editor's note for art. VII.
Sec. 34-189. - Erosion control.
(a)
Design standards. The procedures and requirements of the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance, as may be amended from time to time, shall be applicable whenever any land disturbance is proposed to occur which requires a permit to be obtained by these regulations and shall continue to apply until the project has been completed.
(b)
Abandoned projects. Any project, whose permit has lapsed under the terms expressed in article III of this chapter, shall immediately have all disturbed areas stabilized. This responsibility shall fall upon the owner, developer, contractor, or any and all other responsible parties involved in the land disturbance activity.
