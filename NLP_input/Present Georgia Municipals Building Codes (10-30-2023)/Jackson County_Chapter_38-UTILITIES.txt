(b)
The public shall be notified that this article is in effect, and which step is being implemented, through the news media and by posting notice thereof on the authority's bulletin board at its offices and on the bulletin board located at the county courthouse at least 24 hours prior to this article, or to the particular step, being enforced.

The increased water supply generated by any restrictions to best promote public health and safety.
