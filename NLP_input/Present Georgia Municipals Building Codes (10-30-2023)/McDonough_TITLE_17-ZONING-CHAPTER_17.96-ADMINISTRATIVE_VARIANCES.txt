Sections:
17.96.010 - General provisions.
The director shall have the authority to reduce the setback, buffers, lot sizes and other such regulations, including regulations and limitations placed as conditions by the mayor and council by zoning map amendment, on any lot by an amount not to exceed ten (10) percent of that otherwise required where such variance is warranted by good planning practices and where the goals of this Ccapter are respected. There shall be a fee as established by the director of community development for the consideration of such variance requests.

17.96.020 - Decisions rendered.
The specifics of the request, basis for decision and action taken shall be copied to the mayor and council, and to the chairperson of the board of zoning appeals. The mayor and council may, by simple majority at the next regular meeting after receipt of the communication from the director, veto the decision of the director. Absent veto, the decision of the director shall become final the day after the next regularly scheduled meeting of the mayor and council. Administrative variance decisions shall be maintained for public inspection in the community development department of the city.
(Ord. No. 08-12-29, § XV, 12-29-2008)
17.96.030 - Eminent domain.
If the city or any other lawfully constituted state or federal governmental authority, agency or body or utility having the authority of eminent domain condemns or acquires property in the city, and, as the sole result of such condemnation or acquisition, any nonconformity is created in setback lines, required lot size, density, or parking regulations, the director shall be authorized to grant such administrative variances as are necessary to bring any structure, sign (including a sign as may be relocated in accordance with Section 17.108.160 of the City Code), building or property into conformance upon receipt of a properly documented request, to remain as it exists at the time of condemnation or acquisition. The Director shall be required to maintain records which support the basis for granting such variance. Any variance granted under this section shall only apply to the current zoning district and existing structure, sign or use such that if there is any legally existing nonconformity, the same is not unduly expanded in degree.
( Ord. No. 20-09-21 , § 1, 9-21-2020)
