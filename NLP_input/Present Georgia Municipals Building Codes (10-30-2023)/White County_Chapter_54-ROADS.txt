(Res. No. 94-25, 7-12-94; Res. No. 2002-27, 7-2-02)
Sec. 54-39. - Setting maximum speed limits on roads.
(a)
Determining speed limits for posting.
(1)
The primary purpose of the speed limit is to advise drivers of the maximum reasonable and safe operating speed under favorable conditions.
(2)
Where statutory limits do not fit specific road, traffic, or land uses conditions, pursuant to section 40-06-183 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, local governments have the power to establish and alter speed limits to reflect the safe maximum reasonable speed.
(3)
Legal speed limits are established by law and may be changed only when justified on the basis of an engineering study and in accordance with established traffic engineering practices in conjunction with local and state statutes.
(4)
A widely accepted principle in North America is to set speed limits as near as practicable to the speed below which 85 percent of the vehicles are traveling on the highway. This is called "The Engineering Approach" using the "Operating Speed Method". Experience has shown that approximately 85 percent of motorists drive at a speed that is reasonable and prudent for given traffic and roadway conditions. The 85th percentile speed can be slightly adjusted on the basis of engineering and traffic investigation of each roadway section to be zoned. Speed limits thus established encourage voluntary compliance because they appear reasonable to the public. Those 15 percent of drivers who will not comply with reasonable speed limits are the drivers who are subject to enforcement action.
(b)
Impact of posted speed limits on actual traffic speeds.
(1)
There is a common belief among laymen, and even by some officials, that the mere posting of speed limit signs will cause drivers to react accordingly. This is not true and is why posted speed limits must be realistic to receive compliance.
(2)
It is important to note that setting speed limits lower than 85th percentile speed does not encourage compliance with the posted speed limit unless there is clear and observable existing criterion that dictates lower operating speeds.
(3)
Unrealistically low speed limits will invite violation by responsible drivers. Enforcement of unreasonably low limits sets up the so-called "speed trap" that results in poor public relations. The posting of proper speed limits has the beneficial effects of smoothing traffic flow, aiding effective law enforcement, possibly reducing the potential for vehicle crashes, and promoting driver compliance.

ARTICLE IV. - FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Sec. 54-151. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Res. No. 2003-34, adopted Oct. 7, 2003, repealed section 54-151 in its entirety. Former section 54-151 pertained to establishment of the committee and derived from Res. No. 94-26, adopted July 12, 1994; Res. No. 96-17, adopted May 7, 1996; Res. No. 99-02, § 1, adopted Feb. 2, 1999.
Sec. 54-152. - Standard adopted.
The director of public works will utilize the latest published version of Highway Functional Classification, Concepts, Criteria and Procedures from U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. The director of public works will attempt to adhere to guidelines of the above referenced publication to develop a functional classification system for all county-owned or maintained roads.
(Res. No. 94-26, 7-12-94; Res. No. 96-17, 5-7-96; Res. No. 99-02, § 2, 2-2-99; Res. No. 2003-34, 10-7-03)
Sec. 54-153. - Classification formula.
The director of public works will rank all roads within each functional classification utilizing the following formulas:
(1)
For unpaved county roads: Ranking equals (average daily traffic count divided by rating number) multiplied by type factor multiplied by classification factor and then multiplied by the cost per mile for county maintenance; or
R = (ADT/rate) × type × class factor × cost per mile; and
(2)
For paved county roads: Ranking equals rate multiplied by type factor multiplied by classification factor; or
R = Rate × type × class factor;
where:
a.
Average daily traffic count, if required in the formula, is to be supplied by the planning director;
b.
Rating number of a road is determined by the planning director and public works director utilizing:
1.
PACES rating system of the state department of transportation for paved roads; and
2.
Special Report 8-15, latest version of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers "Rating Unsurfaced Roads" for unpaved roads in the county.
c.
Type factor is:
1.
"Two" for an unpaved road; and
2.
"One" for a paved road.
d.
Classification factor is:
1.
"Two" for roads classified by the director of public works as an artery;
2.
"One and one-half" for roads classified by the director of public works as minor artery; and
3.
"One" for roads classified by the Director of Public Works as local road.
e.
Cost per mile is determined by using the cost of road maintenance for the last ten months and dividing that by the length of the road.
(Res. No. 94-26, 7-12-94; Res. No. 96-17, 5-7-96; Res. No. 99-02, § 3, 2-2-99; Res. No. 2002-34, 8-6-02; Res. No. 2003-34, 10-7-03)
Sec. 54-154. - Final ranking.
After the classification of roads pursuant to this article, the director of public works and the director of planning will present to the board of commissioners a final ranking of all roads, utilizing the ranking formula set out in this article. This final road ranking list will be used to prioritize the future paving of unpaved roads.
(Res. No. 2003-34, 10-7-03)
Editor's note— Res. No. 2003-34, adopted Oct. 7, 2003, repealed section 54-154 in its entirety and replaced it with a new section 54-154. Former section 54-154 pertained to the map of roads and derived from Res. No. 94-26, adopted July 12, 1994; Res. No. 96-17, adopted May 7, 1996; Res. No. 99-02, § 4, adopted Feb. 2, 1999.

(Ord. No. 2009-13, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 2010-28, 10-4-10)
Sec. 54-199. - Location, design and construction of the driveway.
(a)
The location, design and construction of the driveway shall be in accordance with the following standards.
(1)
The director shall authorize all modification to these standards in writing:
a.
A driveway shall be located and restricted as to width as necessary so that the entire driveway and its appurtenances are contained within the frontage along the roadway of the property served. At public roadway intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the public roadway intersection area and shall not encroach on or occupy areas of the roadway or right-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control or for roadway signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the roadway (see figure 6 at the end of this article).
b.
The number of driveways permitted serving a single property frontage shall be a maximum of two unless the director deems more necessary by for reasonable service to the property without undue impairment of safety, convenience and utility of roadway.
c.
If the property has frontage on more than one street, the director may request a recommendation from the director of planning as to the potential adverse affects, which may result. If it is determined that the construction of such a driveway would cause a nuisance to the surrounding area, a traffic hazard or unduly congested traffic, the director shall deny the permit.
d.
Subdivision of arterial street frontage where a tract of land is subdivided on an arterial street after the adoption of this provision such that a lot with less than 60 feet of frontage is created, access to such lot shall be from either:
1.
A driveway serving the remainder of the tract from which the lot was cut; or
2.
A joint driveway; or
3.
A frontage road; or
4.
An adjacent non-arterial street if a corner of double-frontage lot.
e.
The island area on the right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the roadway shoulder and right-of-way line shall remain unimproved for vehicular travel or parking. Such areas shall be considered as restricted and may be filled in or graded down only as hereinafter provided in subsection h. of this section.
f.
The surface of the driveway connecting with rural type roadway sections shall slope down and away from the roadway shoulder a sufficient amount and distance, to preclude ordinary surface water drainage from the driveway area flooding onto the roadway roadbed. In cases where terrain will not allow adequate surface water drainage, the director will determine the best possible typical section to ensure the least amount of surface water flooding the roadbed.
g.
The driveway shall not obstruct or impair drainage in side ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where necessary, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the roadway and in no case be less than equivalent of 15-inch diameter corrugated metal pipe. The director shall determine culvert diameter during the driveway permitting process. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall be not less than ten feet except as provided for in subsection h of this section.
h.
When driveway construction requires the removal of curb and gutter, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns provided or restored in a neat, competent manner acceptable to the director. The driveway surface shall connect with the roadway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a neat, competent manner. The driveway construction shall include replacement due to vehicular travel across the sidewalk.
i.
The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in or graded down only when the following requirements are fully complied with:
1.
The filling or grading down to grades approved by the director, water drainage shall be directed away from the roadway except where drainage is by means of curb and gutter.
2.
Culvert extension under the restricted area shall be of like size and equivalent acceptable material of the driveway culvert, and intermediate manholes or drop inlets adequate for clean-out purposes may be required where the total culvert length exceeds 60 feet. The director must approve any deviation to this length.
3.
Permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the roadway roadbed, to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts deemed adequate by the director where no side ditch separates the restricted area from the roadbed.
(Ord. No. 2009-13, 6-1-09)
Sec. 54-200. - Specific design standards.

b.
Where it is apparent that the intent is not to provide access but to provide parking only, The Director shall not issue an approval. A driveway approach must provide access to something definite on private property such as a parking area considerably greater in extent than the width of the driveway, or provide access to a driveway, or to a door at least nine feet wide intended for the entrance of vehicles, etc. (Not applicable for residential driveways.)
(5)
Distance to side property lines: The development of a driveway is permissible on public right-of-way (E) within five feet of the frontage boundary line.
a.
A minimum of one and one-half feet of pavement edge or curb, shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each frontage boundary line to serve as an island area. This measurement is the distance between the frontage boundary line and the point of tangency of the driveway radius and edge of pavement, measured along the edge of pavement.
b.
Subsection "a" or "b" of this section shall apply, whichever is more restrictive.
c.
The director may waive these requirements when a single driveway serves two adjacent lots.
(6)
Island areas.
a.
Minimum island dimensions:
1.
The distance between double driveways (D) shall be 20 feet minimum at the narrowest point at the street side; and
2.
The minimum island depth shall be four feet where parking abuts street right-of-way line.
b.
Treatment of island or buffer area. In the development of private property and the construction of driveways thereto, it may be necessary to re-grade the buffer area by cutting or filling. Such work shall insure adequate sight distance for traffic operations, proper drainage, suitable slopes for maintenance operations, and good appearance. The grading, use of curbs, rails, guideposts, low walls, low shrubs, etc. in a manner, which will not impair clear sight across the area shall prohibit vehicles in the buffer area.
c.
Visibility clearance. No landscaping, fences, terraces or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety, nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians.

Multifamily residential use. Beginning at point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of ten feet along the right-of-way in the direction approaching traffic, thence to a point of ten feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to point of beginning. See figure 5B at the end of this article.
(7)
Intersection clearance. The length, width and shape of corner island areas will vary for different locations. The angle of intersection, angle of driveways, width of the right-of-way on both approaches, channelization radii, and other conditions will influence the location of driveways at intersections. The location and angle of an approach in relation to the roadway intersection shall be such that a vehicle:
a.
Leaving the service facility may be merged in the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction before crossing the intersection; and
b.
Entering the facility from the intersection may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of interference to through traffic.
(7.1)
The following conditions may be applicable in most instances:
a.
No driveway shall encroach upon pavement edge radii.
b.
The following minimum distances from the intersection right-of-way line (C) shall apply where there is no conflict with the foregoing conditions:
1.
Average daily traffic of 1,500 or less, 20 feet; and
2.
Average daily traffic over 1,500 but less than 10,000, 35 feet; and
3.
Average daily traffic over 10,000 but less than 15,000, 50 feet; and
4.
Average daily traffic over 15,000, 65 feet. The director shall have the authority to increase these distances if in his opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic. The director may also modify these requirements if justifiable based on site conditions; and
5.
The planning department may provide projected traffic volumes in determining minimum distances rather than current traffic volumes.
(8)
Parking and storage areas.
a.
Each roadside business establishment, when providing off-street parking or storage space, shall provide such parking or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the travel way. The need is for businesses where a number of vehicles will be leaving and entering at the same time.
b.
The director shall pay particular attention to drive-in facilities such as banks, minute car washes, drive-in restaurants, drive-in bill paying facilities and other service facilities that serve motorist while in their vehicles, to insure that queues of vehicles will not extend out onto the public streets.
(9)
Driveway grade.
a.
Apartments, commercial and industrial driveways. The maximum grade permitted is eight percent.
b.
Existing shoulder slope, utilities or existing and future sidewalk elevations in the right-of-way shall determine the grade.
c.
The underside clearance and/or break over angle of driveways for special use vehicles shall dictate the maximum driveway grade.
(10)
Paving.
a.
When driveways access paved county roads, the pavement shall continue to the right-of-way line, prescriptive easement line or be paved 20 feet in length, whichever option is greater.
b.
The paving of acceleration and deceleration lanes is required. Pavement structure shall at least match that of the adjoining existing pavement and shall not be less than specified in writing or drawings by the county director. Materials and construction methods shall meet county standards.
(11)
Left-turn restrictions.
a.
On arterial streets and if in the judgment of the director necessary on collector and local streets, left turns into or out of driveways shall be denied by the construction of channelizing structures under the following conditions:
1.
Inadequate corner clearance; or
2.
Inadequate sight distance; or
3.
Inadequate driveway spacing; or
4.
Site has a signalized driveway on the same arterial at which left turns can be made; or
5.
Other capacity, delay or safety conditions make specific left turns dangerous.
(12)
Acceleration, deceleration lanes.
a.
Required. If driveways provide access to a non-residential use facility utilizing a common driveway entrance on an arterial street, the property owner shall construct acceleration and deceleration lanes. An acceleration lane shall not generally be required, but the driveway radius shall turn out as if construction of a lane and taper were to be constructed. An acceleration lane shall be required where the required taper will merge with the taper of an existing deceleration lane or is within 20 feet of merging.
b.
Length. Each such lane shall be 150 feet in length, with an additional tapered transition section 50 feet in length. Lane pavement width shall be 12 feet.
c.
Property lines. The director may approve an altered design where a lane or taper would merge with a lane or taper provided for adjoining property or would encroach on the corner radius of a street intersection. If there is adequate, right-of-way in front of the adjoining, property and a lane or taper would extend across a frontage boundary line such lane or taper shall be constructed
d.
Right-of-way dedication. The property owner by way of recorded right of way deed shall dedicate any additional right-of-way necessary for construction of a lane and the abutting curb and gutter and the accommodation of utilities to the county.
e.
All driveways requiring acceleration or deceleration lanes shall have site plans submitted to and approved by the director. A performance bond or letter of credit will be required in an amount equal to all work proposed for acceleration or deceleration lanes in the county right of way.
f.
Exceptions. The following land uses are excluded from the requirement for acceleration/deceleration lanes:
1.
Warehouse use with less than 10,000 square feet of building area; and
2.
Manufacturing use with less than 13,000 square feet of building; and
3.
Light industrial use with less than 7,000 square feet of building area; and
4.
Heavy industrial use with less than 33,000 square feet of building area; and
5.
Nursing home with fewer than 19 beds; and
6.
Medical office use with less than 1,000 square feet of building area; and
7.
General office use with less than 3,000 square feet of building area; and
8.
Office park (mixed office uses) with less than 2,000 square feet of building area.
g.
A mixture of the above uses will require a case-by-case determination of traffic generation by the director. Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be required when sufficient additional development occurs on property previously excepted from the requirement.
(13)
Temporary driveways. Temporary condition permits are typically driveways constructed to perform logging operations or other short duration activity such as construction entrances. Where property owner's desire access to property but will delay building upon that property for six months or longer, a temporary driveway may be used. The director based on use, needs of the property owner, and considerations towards protecting county right of way and roadways, will consider design standards for any temporary driveway case by case.
(14)
The department shall permit all driveways, regardless of use or type, in collaboration with planning and building inspections.
