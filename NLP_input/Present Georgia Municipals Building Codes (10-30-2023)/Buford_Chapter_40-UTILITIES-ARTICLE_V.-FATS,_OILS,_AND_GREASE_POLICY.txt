Recyclable fats, oils and greases shall not be discharged into the POTW. Any violation in the removal of grease waste shall result in prosecution under state law. Maintenance shall be performed at frequencies as required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Outdoor grease interceptor. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals required by the city to keep effluent FOG levels at less than 100 mg/L. Where the city requirement is not stated, maintenance intervals shall be at least once every 90 days unless approved by the city. While the 30 percent rule may be followed, it does not ensure compliance with the mandatory limit of 100 mg/L. In general, the 30 percent rule is as follows: The depth of both bottom solids and oil/grease in a trap shall not equal or be greater than 30 percent of the total operating depth of the trap; the operating depth of a trap is the internal depth from the inlet or outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap. Any solids interceptor should be emptied and cleaned daily. Outdoor grease interceptors shall have a minimum of 1,500-gallon capacity.
(2)
Indoor grease trap. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals at least once every 30 days. A variance is required to operate an indoor grease trap in place of a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor interceptor. Indoor grease traps shall have a minimum of 100-pound capacity. Any current user connected to the city sewage collection system that currently operates an indoor grease trap, regardless of size, shall prove to the satisfaction of the city that they are not discharging illegally, or the user shall be required to upgrade to a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor grease interceptor. Users may not operate indoor grease traps with a capacity less than 100 pounds. A solids interceptor tied to an indoor grease trap should be emptied and cleaned daily. Waste solids must be placed into a receptable to be picked up by a licensed waste hauler and not be disposed into the city sanitary sewer.
(3)
Pumping variance. Variances may be granted if the owner/user can prove at their expense to the city's satisfaction that the discharge from the owner/user's grease trap or interceptor is meeting the city's discharge limit up to 180 consecutive days for outdoor grease interceptors or 120 consecutive days for indoor grease traps.
(4)
Additives. It is specifically prohibited to use any additive, such as enzymes, chemicals, or bacteria as a substitute for grease trap maintenance. The direct addition of such additives to a grease trap is also prohibited.
(5)
Waste removal. The owner/user shall be responsible for the proper removal and legal disposal of the grease trap waste. All waste removed from each grease trap shall be tracked by an approved three-part manifest and the contents shall be disposed of at a facility permitted to receive such waste. In no manner shall any grease trap contents be discharged to the city sewer or stormwater system.
(6)
Manifest transmittal. The user shall maintain a legible copy of the completed three-part manifest on site for each service event. Failure to provide all manifests for review by city grease inspectors may result in a fine at the discretion of the city.
(Ord. of 1-5-2015(2), § 4.2)
Sec. 40-541. - Recordkeeping by user.
It shall be a violation of this policy for a user to allow the removal of their grease trap waste without documentation by an approved three-part manifest.

Sec. 40-542. - Grease trap/interceptor inspections by the city.
(a)
Failed inspection. If a grease trap or interceptor fails the initial inspection, the inspector may notify the owner/user that the grease trap shall be cleaned out within seven calendar days. After seven calendar days, the grease trap or interceptor should be re-inspected.
(b)
Failed reinspection. If, at the first re-inspection, the grease trap or interceptor is found to still be in noncompliance, a notice of violation may be issued and the owner/user may be told that the grease trap or interceptor shall be cleaned immediately. After three weekdays, the grease trap may be re-inspected.
(c)
Disregard of FOG NOV. If an owner/user served with a NOV fails to initiate/complete corrective action within the time frame specified within the NOV, the city may pursue one or more of the following options:
(1)
Have the grease trap or interceptor pumped and place the appropriate charge on the user's monthly water and sewer bill.
(2)
Terminate water and sewer service to the establishment.
(3)
File an appropriate action in the courts to compel compliance.
(4)
Any combination of the enforcement actions provided in subsections (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(Ord. of 1-5-2015(2), § 4.4)
Sec. 40-543. - FOG best management practices (FOG BMPs).
In order to enhance the overall efficiency of the grease trap or interceptor, food establishments should implement FOG BMPs to reduce FOG and solids loading to their grease trap or interceptor. Examples of FOG BMPs are:
(1)
Scraping food from pots, pans, plates and utensils into a garbage can;
(2)
Installation of a solid waste interceptor;
(3)
Pre-washing plates by spraying them off with cold water over a small mesh catchbasin positioned over a drain. The catchbasin should be cleaned into a garbage can as needed; and
