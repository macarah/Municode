Sec. 18-269. - Purpose.
This division is enacted to promote the general welfare of the city; to establish reasonable and ascertainable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing of establishments classified as general pawnbrokers and vehicle pawnbrokers as defined by this division; and to prevent undesirable persons from engaging in or having an interest in establishments classified as general pawnbrokers and vehicle pawnbrokers as defined by this division.
(Code 1991, § 18-211; Ord. of 9-23-1991, § I(14-72))
Sec. 18-270. - Compliance with chapter required.
It shall be unlawful for any person to operate as a pawnbroker as defined in section 18-268, which shall include general pawnbrokers and vehicle pawnbrokers, without first having complied with the provisions of this chapter, but the properly licensed operation of same is hereby declared lawful.
(Code 1991, § 18-212; Ord. of 9-23-1991, § I(14-73))
Sec. 18-271. - License required; consideration and approval; subsequent issuance; conditional approval.
Each application provided for in this division shall be considered and passed upon by the city council or its designee in regular or special session, legally assembled. No license shall be granted to any person unless it is made to appear to the city council that the applicant is a suitable and fit person to carry on such business, and that the business will be conducted in an orderly manner and in compliance with all laws, municipal, state and federal. Upon approval of the application and payment of the required license fee, the applicant shall be entitled to the issuance of the license; provided, however, the council reserves the right to approve such issuance of the license conditioned upon the full and final compliance by the licensee with all applicable city ordinances.
(Code 1991, § 18-213; Ord. of 9-23-1991, § I(14-74))
Sec. 18-272. - Disqualification provisions.
When contrary to the public interest and welfare, no original application shall be considered and no license to operate as a pawnbroker shall be issued by the city council to or for:
(1)
Any person as determined by the city council by reason of such person's business experience, financial standing, moral character, mental capacity, trade associations, personal associations, record of arrest, or reputation in any community in which the person has resided, who is not likely to maintain the operation for which the person is seeking license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations.
(2)
Any person who shall have been convicted or who shell have entered a plea of nolo contendere or forfeited a bond, to any felony within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of any such application or to any misdemeanor within a period of five years immediately prior to the filing of any such application, for any felony or misdemeanor of any state, or of the United States, or any municipal ordinance except a traffic violation, particularly, but not limited to, those involving force or violence, prostitution, alcoholic beverages, gambling or tax law violation, if such conviction, plea or forfeiture tends to indicate that the applicant will not maintain the operation for which the person is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations. The term "conviction" shall include an adjudication of guilt or plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere or the forfeiture of a bond by a person charged with a crime. Notwithstanding this provision, the city council, in its sole discretion, may direct the issuance of a license to a person who has in the past been convicted of, or plead guilty to, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or forfeited a bond on any crime, and the city council after a thorough investigation of all the facts, including parole or probation officer's reports, judge's recommendations, and any other evidence bearing on the character of the applicant has determined that such action is in keeping with the public good and ends of justice or the public interest and welfare.
(Code 1991, § 18-214; Ord. of 9-23-1991, § I(14-75))
Sec. 18-273. - Application forms; license not to issue under certain conditions.
(a)
All applications for licenses shall be made on forms furnished the applicant by the tax and licensing official and shall indicate, along with all reasonable information necessary to complete the form, which of the following is to be considered for licensing of the applicant to conduct:
(1)
Pawnbroker—General.
(2)
Pawnbroker—Vehicle pawn.
(b)
Upon approval by the city council of an original or renewal application for license of one or more of the above types of businesses, such business may be conducted by the applicant after a license is issued for all or the remaining part of the calendar year in which the license is issued unless the license is revoked or suspended for due cause as provided in section 18-275. An application for renewal of license to operate as a pawnbroker shall be filed with the tax and licensing official no later than 5:00 p.m. on January 15th of each year. The annual fee for the license sought to be renewed shall be paid to the city at the time the application for renewal is filed. Failure of any holder of a license to operate as a pawnbroker to file the application for renewal by the date and time specified shall render the license void, effective the last legal hour on January 15th of that year for such business. In order to operate as a pawnbroker a license holder who has allowed the license to lapse shall file a new application for license as if a license had never been held and pursuant to the previous sections of this article. Where an application for renewal is timely filed as provided in this article, the license holder shall be permitted to continue operating as a pawnbroker under the previous year's license until the city council has acted upon the license holder's application for renewal.
(c)
The tax and licensing official of the city shall cause an inquiry to be made into the records of the city to determine if any applicant or other parties interested in an application have any outstanding taxes or special assessments that are delinquent or any other moneys owing to the city. No license shall be issued nor shall a license be renewed until all such debts are paid in full.
(d)
All applications required by this chapter shall be investigated by the city police department and the report of the investigation presented to the city council for consideration with the application.

The following annual fees shall be paid the city before any license to operate as a pawnbroker is issued:
(1)
General pawnbrokers: $150.00.
(2)

(b)
Upon filing an original application or reapplication (except renewals) with the tax and licensing official of the city, the applicant shall deposit in cash or by a check a processing fee of $100.00 total, for all licenses applied for, to cover the expense of investigation and processing the application, which fee shall not be refundable and shall not be applied against the cost of any license hereunder.
(c)
In subsection (a) of this section, the fees shall be prorated on a monthly basis (all of any part of a month) and should the business be sold, the license fee, if previously paid, may be transferred in favor of a new applicant. If the business should close voluntarily or if the licensee ceases operating as a pawnbroker other than because the license is suspended or revoked, then an amount may be refunded, upon application by the licensee, prorated on the basis of the amount of the fee previously paid per month multiplied by number of full months remaining in the calendar year, which sum shall be the refunded amount.
(Code 1991, § 18-216; Ord. of 9-23-1991, § I(14-77))
Sec. 18-275. - Suspension; revocation of license; denial of renewal or transfer.
(a)
Notice, hearing. Any license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the city to any licensee may be denied, suspended or revoked or transfer refused, by the city council for due cause. Before the city council shall deny any application for a license or shall deny the transfer of any license, or shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the tax and licensing official to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice, why the application for, or renewal of, a license or for transfer of license should not be denied, or why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefor. At the appointed time and place the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exists, why the application should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing provided for in this section need not be at a regular meeting of the city council, but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice. All decisions denying, suspending or revoking any license or application shall be in writing, with the reasons therefor stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided in this section, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, and have testimony recorded at the party's expense.
(b)
Due cause generally.
(1)
Due cause for the suspension, revocation or denial of the renewal or transfer of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the city council, after a hearing as above provided, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any city ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances, or failure of the licensee or the licensee's employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinance.
(2)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof, or the owner or any person connected therewith ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter.
(3)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(c)
Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with the city police acting in the line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or any employee thereof to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all police powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the chief of police shall immediately order all pawnbroking business suspended until after a hearing as set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (a) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(d)
Refund of license fee. When a license is so revoked or suspended, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.
(e)
Emergency situation. The mayor is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in an emergency situation, and such suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the city council.
(f)
Penalties for failure to comply. Any violators of the provisions set out in this division shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of section 1-7.
(Code 1991, § 18-217; Ord. of 9-25-1991, § I(14-78))
Sec. 18-276. - Transfer of license; changes of ownership, locations.
(a)
Licenses hereunder shall not be transferable except as otherwise provided in this section.
(b)
In the case of the death of any person owning a license or any interest therein, with the approval of the city council and subject to the terms of this section, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor or personal representative of the deceased person, or to the heirs at law of the deceased person, if such administrator, executor or personal representative or heirs meet all of the other qualifications contained in this section. The license of such deceased person shall be held by the administrator, executor or personal representative of such deceased person only for the time necessary to complete execution of such deceased person's estate and disposition of the license or such deceased person's interest therein, but in no event to exceed six months.
(c)
Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license from withdrawing from the partnership and assigning the partner's interest in such partnership to one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. Such withdrawal shall not, however, serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership, unless all provisions of this section are fully complied with, and then only upon the approval of the city council.
(d)
Any change in the ownership interests contained on the application shall cause the immediate cessation of pawnbrokering business and no such business shall be conducted until any such change in the ownership interests are approved by the city council; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply in a situation where one or more individuals who have ownership interests in the license cease to have such ownership interest, but the remaining ownership interests remain unchanged except as to the division of the remaining interests.
(e)
An application for a new license for an existing licensed location shall meet the requirements of a new license to be issued hereunder, except payment of license fee shall be waived only in the case of a purchaser of a business where an existing license remains valid. The investigation fee will accompany the application and the unearned portion of the license fee may be transferred to the new license in the event the transfer or issuance of a new license on an existing licensed location is approved by the city council.
