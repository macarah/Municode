Sec. 10-91. - Conditions of the permit.
(a)
Intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes.
(1)
Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced.
(2)
Notwithstanding the initiation of work pursuant to a building permit, a building permit shall be subject to a utilization period of 24 months from date of issuance. The permit shall expire and become invalid after the given utilization period has elapsed. The utilization period begins on the date of permit issuance. The expiration date for the building permit shall be specified on the permit. An exception to the 24-month expiration may be granted in accordance with [subsection] (3) below.
(3)
Upon request of the applicant for a building permit at the time of the initial application, the building official may approve an expiration date exceeding the utilization period if the applicant demonstrates that the complexity and size of the project makes completion of the project within the utilization period unreasonable.
(4)
A request for an extension of the utilization period may be submitted no later than 20 calendar days prior to the expiration of the utilization period. The building official may extend the building permit one time for a period up to and not exceeding 180 calendar days if the applicant shows that the work pursuant to the permit cannot be completed within the utilization period due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control. The applicant's name, address, telephone number, the building permit number, site address and a description of the circumstances beyond the applicant's control which prevented completion of the work prior to the expiration date shall be submitted to the building official. If the project is less than 50 percent complete (as determined by the building official), the building official shall require a performance bond to be submitted prior to approval of the extension. If a performance bond is required, the amount of the bond shall be justified with a cost estimate from the applicant for the completion of the project.
(b)
Issued on basis of affidavit.
(1)
Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work.
(2)
In addition, the architect or engineer shall be responsible for:
a.
Conformity with the permit;
b.
Providing copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed; and
c.
Upon completion make and file with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes.
(3)
In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his or her place a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official.
(c)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he or she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance."
(1)
One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant.
(2)
The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his or her authorized representative.
(Ord. No. 06-11-58, § 1(ch. 9, art. 2, § 7(f)), 11-21-2006; Ord. No. 07-02-09, § 1(ch. 9, art. 2, § 7(f)), 2-15-2007; Ord. No. 12-07-139, § 1, 7-16-2012)

(a)
Required. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or gas systems, etc., has been paid.
(b)
Work commencing before permit issuance; penalty. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure or electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees.
(c)
Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of:
(1)
All permit fees and other money collected; and
(2)
The names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof.
(d)
Schedule. On all buildings, structures or electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing an application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the governing body.
(e)
Building permit valuations.
(1)
Denied if underestimated. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official.
(2)
Included in calculation. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment, and other systems, including materials and labor.
