C.
The I-20 Corridor Overlay District shall be divided into three (3) tiers to guide future development and redevelopment. The tiers are based on the future land use recommendations.
Tier 1—High-intensity area focused around the four (4) activity centers of Panola, Wesley Chapel, Candler Road and the Gresham Road area. The purpose of this tier is to allow the most intense mixed-use development. The goal is to allow for redevelopment of the oversized parking areas with new buildings including retail, office, and residential on one (1) parcel to decrease the need for vehicular trips. The maximum height shall be up to twenty (20) stories and sixty (60) dwelling units/acre.
Tier 2—Medium-intensity area wraps around the high-intensity area or at the locations of Snapfinger Woods and I-20/I-285 intersections. The purpose of this tier is to allow medium-density development in a mixed-use development. The maximum height shall be up to eight (8) stories and allows for up to forty (40) dwelling units per acre.
Tier 3—Low-intensity area which provides for a transition from the higher-intensity areas and more compatibility to the single-family neighborhoods adjacent to the overlay boundaries. The maximum height shall be up to four (4) stories and allows up to forty (40) dwelling units per acre.
