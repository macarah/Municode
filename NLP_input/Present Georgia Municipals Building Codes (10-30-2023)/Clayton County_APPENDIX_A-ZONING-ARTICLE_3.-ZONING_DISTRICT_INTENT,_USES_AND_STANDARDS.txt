Sec. 3.35 - MX—Mixed Use District.
*See Attachment A for list of permitted uses.
Sec. 1.0 District Intent
National trends toward urbanization are bolstering many "town centers" and neighborhood commercial districts, creating new destinations across the Atlanta region. The success of these new places is driven by burgeoning traffic congestion in Atlanta and market demand being generated by Millennials. This age cohort is seeking reduced commuting times and environments that offer a wide range of services and activities. Mixed Use Districts have been devised that revisit traditional development patterns. These districts can deliver a variety of housing options in close proximity to employment, consumer services, entertainment, recreation, public art and gathering spaces all within a setting that emphasizes walking rather than vehicle trips.
The Mixed Use District is intended to capitalize on this market demand by establishing standards more consistent with that market than commercial districts of the past that are more suburban in character. These standards allow the flexibility developers of mixed use projects desire.
The District promotes tailoring of development scale to the context by introducing a site plan specific process in which the development standards of the District are woven into an approved site plan. In this manner, development scale may be referenced to a neighborhood context as well as to a development setting more regional in scale.
A full range of urban housing, employment, retail and entertainment options is accommodated by the Mixed Use District. Development standards are geared toward traditional downtowns with buildings at the street, dwellings above store fronts and offices and broad sidewalks and streetscapes designed to encourage a lively street scene.
The Millennial market is generating demand for active and passive recreation, alternate transportation modes and greater social interaction. The creation of destinations that offer such public amenities proximate to developer generated housing, employment and shopping is a central tenet of the Mixed Use District.

Sec. 11.0 Architectural Standards
A.
Fenestration in the MX District. Architectural design of all buildings and structures shall adhere to the following standards:

Display windows and pedestrian entrances shall be provided on all primary building facades. Buildings on corner lots shall also provide display windows on the secondary facade with pedestrian entrances on such facades provided at the owner's option.
2.
Primary facades shall be detailed as storefronts and glazed with clear glass no less than 60 percent of the length of the facade to a minimum height of eight feet.
3.
The length of primary facades shall not exceed 20 feet without intervening fenestration, architectural detailing or entryway.
4.
Significant building elements such as balconies, porches, canopies, towers, entry features, etc. that visually divide the facade shall be incorporated into building design.
5.
A maximum of 15 percent of fenestration treatments may utilize architectural detailing in lieu of glass materials to meet the fenestration treatment standards.
6.
Pedestrian entrances may be used to comply with the fenestration treatment standards.
7.
Multi-level buildings with commercial, office, service or residential uses shall create a clearly-defined street edge and provide upper-story activities, which overlook the street and plazas.
8.
Service/utility areas or enclosures shall not be located in or be visible from public plazas or courts.
B.
Building Materials. Exterior facades visible from any thoroughfare shall utilize brick, glass, wood, hard coat stucco or approved Dryvit stucco, stone (including faux stone) or cement-based siding materials. Metal or metallic materials may be permitted, but shall not constitute more than 30 percent of any individual facade.
C.
Streetscape/Pedestrian Scale.
1.
Pavements, street trees, pedestrian scale lighting, street lights, benches, signs, trash receptacles, etc. along streets should be consistent and help create an identifiable character for the area.
2.
Street trees with tree grates and landscaping are required on primary and secondary streets and medians.
3.
Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete. Special textured pavers, brick, colored concrete, and pavers or a combination of these materials that provide patterns and/or decorative tones shall be used to accent sidewalk and plaza areas.
4.
A 14-foot wide streetscape is required on both sides of the street that includes ground floor retail and office uses. The streetscape includes a 4-foot curb zone (for street trees, street lights, landscaping and pedestrian amenities) and a 10-foot wide sidewalk.
5.
Pedestrian-oriented ground-floor retail, restaurant or other pedestrian-oriented use is required on building fronts. Public facilities such as a library or community center would also be considered pedestrian-oriented uses.
D.
Parking Lot Landscaping.
1.
One (1) canopy tree for every four parking spaces distributed throughout designated parking areas shall be provided.
2.
Individual parking bays shall be separated by a landscape median having a minimum width of eight feet. In addition, end aisle landscaped islands having a minimum width of eight feet and a minimum depth of 16 feet shall be established for every 10 parking spaces.
3.
Parking lots fronting on any street shall be screened by a landscaped buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of five feet and using the following, additional screening techniques. Acceptable screening shall be of durable construction materials and/or appropriate landscaping including:
a.
A trellis or grillwork of steel or cast iron with vines;
b.
A low masonry or stone wall or planter between 36 and 42 inches high combined with a five-foot landscaped buffer;
c.
Landscaped buffer of trees and evergreen shrubs sufficient to form a solid screen; or
d.
Landscaped berm of sufficient height and width to visually obscure parking areas.
E.
Parking Lot Standards.
1.
Shared parking between land uses is encouraged where it can be demonstrated that parking demands of the respective uses occur at different times of the day or on different days.
2.
On-street parking on public streets in the Mixed Use District may be credited toward required parking, provided the spaces are located along the frontage of the property accepting this parking credit.
3.
Parking areas shall be designed as smaller, scattered lots rather than large lots and be screened from view from adjacent streets and building occupants. A guideline of 48 spaces as an upper limit is encouraged.
4.
Parking lots shall not be located between the primary facade of commercial buildings and the street.
5.
Parking lots exceeding 48 spaces on a collector or local street or 100 spaces on an arterial shall be divided into smaller connected lots to minimize the impact of vehicles. Creation of substantially landscaped areas no less than eight feet wide shall be provided to divide large parking areas.
6.
Curb cuts for parking lots should be minimized by requiring shared entrances and exits, where appropriate. All developments shall provide interparcel access, with written agreements between adjacent property owners subject to approval by the Clayton County Department of Transportation.
7.
A pedestrian crosswalk shall be provided at all parking lot entrances and exits.
8.
Lighting shall be provided in parking lots and adjacent landscaped areas for greater visibility and security. All such lighting shall be directed downward and into the site to avoid spillover.
9.
Permeable pavements, excluding such materials intended for industrial applications such as #57 stone, are permitted. Parking requirements may be reduced up to 10 percent in exchange for application of Low Impact Development design that routes stormwater into landscaped areas rather than sheet flowing to a stormwater collection device.
