ARTICLE X. - SIGNS

Sec. 111-366. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose. The purposes of these sign regulations are to encourage the efficient and effective use of signs as a means of communications in the city; to balance, maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment of the city and its ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic flow and safety; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. These concerns are reflected by the city actively participating in and regulating the size, location and number of signs and the overall appearance and design of signs.
(b)
Goals. The following goals are incorporated into the regulations:
(1)
Communication. Signs should not deny other persons or groups the use of sight lines on or to public rights-of-way, should not obscure important public messages or warnings, and should not overwhelm readers with too many messages.
(2)
Preservation of the city's beauty. The city includes an historic district, as well as commercial centers and residential areas. The city relies heavily on the beautification efforts of its active population to obtain and maintain an economic advantage in the region.
(3)
Property value protection. Signs should not create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, brightness or movement. They should be in harmony with buildings, the neighborhood, and other conforming signs in the area.

(1)
Temporary signs. The city finds that, in view of the inexpensive nature of these signs and the administrative burden which would be imposed by elaborate procedural prerequisites prior to removal, any procedure other than summary removal of these signs when unlawfully erected and maintained would defeat the purpose of regulating such signs.

After removal of a sign pursuant to this section, and in addition to any notice of violation, citation or summons issued, a notice will be sent, either by hand delivery or by first-class mail to the occupant of the property from which the sign was removed, or if the sign identifies a party other than the occupant of the property, the party so identified. The notice shall advise that the sign has been removed and shall state that the sign may be retrieved within 30 days of the date of the notice upon payment of the fee established therefor, and that, if the sign is not retrieved within 30 days, it will be disposed by the city.
(2)
Permanent signs. Signs and sign structures not subject to removal pursuant to the provisions above, which are or have been erected or maintained unlawfully, are subject to all remedies available at law or equity to it to remove signs or sign structures which are or have been unlawfully erected or maintained.
