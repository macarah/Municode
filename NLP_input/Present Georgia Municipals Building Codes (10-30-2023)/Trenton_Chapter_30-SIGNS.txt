ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 30-1. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever-increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises.
(b)
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens.
(c)
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefitting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(d)
The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

The mayor and council shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 days following the close of the appeal hearing. Decisions of the mayor and council to affirm the decision of the building official or to overrule the decision of the building official and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation. Such decision shall constitute a final determination by the city.

(d)
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the building official ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within 20 business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be handled as provided in section 30-6(h).
(e)
If the person to whom notice is directed fails to take corrective action within the time period prescribed, or if on appeal the mayor and council affirm the decision of the building official and the person fails to take corrective action or remove the offending sign within the time period prescribed, then; the building official shall proceed to have the sign removed or corrected to bring such sign into compliance with this article or to remove any unsafe condition.
(f)
When it is determined by the building official that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety and contact cannot be made with the sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served prior to removal. In such emergency situation, the building official shall document the unsafe condition and may correct the danger, with all costs being charged to the sign owner or the property owner.
(g)
If it shall be necessary for the building official to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the building official may sell or salvage any material derived in the removal.

Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known, or if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for benefit of the owner for a period of three years. At the end of three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become the property the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the costs of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located.
