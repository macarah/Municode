Sec. 6-2. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide regulations governing the construction, reconstruction, and alteration of streets and blocks within the city.
Sec. 6-3. - Measurements.
A.
Block and lot standard measurements shall be made at the edge of the full right-of-way.
B.
Sidewalk landscaped area width and total sidewalk width measurements shall be taken from the back of curb nearest the sidewalk.

Sec. 6-4. - Block sizes.
Whenever a development of four acres or greater is to be developed or redeveloped, maximum block size requirements shall apply.
A.
The maximum block size is 200 feet by 400 feet.

B.
The minimum length of a single block face is 180 feet. A decrease in block face length may be approved by the mayor and council when it is determined that such minimum length is not feasible due to limitations imposed by existing street locations or other fixed structural or topographical features, and that pedestrian and vehicular safety is not impaired.

Blocks shall be formed by streets, not alleys.
Sec. 6-5. - Sidewalks.
A sidewalk shall be located at the sole expense of the developer or builder along all streets within the Commercial District, and along all arterial and collector streets within the city, in keeping with the following requirements
A.
Three parts of a sidewalk: Sidewalks consist of three required areas, a sidewalk landscape zone for street trees and street furniture, a sidewalk clear zone for pedestrian travel, and a supplemental front yard for commercial outdoor dining and product displays, and for residential steps, stoops and porches. Width requirements for each of the three areas of the sidewalk are as indicated on the street type and sidewalk area table located at the end of this section.
B.
Street configuration shall not intrude into the required sidewalk area: Buildings shall be located a sufficient distance from the back of the street curb, in order to ensure that all required sidewalk landscaped zone, clear zone, and supplemental yard widths are met or exceeded. Further, sidewalk width, including the sidewalk landscaped zone, shall not be reduced adjacent to a street's right-turn lane.
C.
Reduction of sidewalk landscaped zone at intersections: At street intersections and driveway crossings, the landscaped zone may be reduced within the area where street pavement widens to provide a turning radius for right-turning vehicles.
D.
At street intersections, the corners of buildings shall be cut at an angle, curved, or otherwise setback an additional distance, where needed to ensure that all sidewalk clear zone and supplemental zone requirements are met or exceeded.
E.
Within the sidewalk landscape zone, the following applies.

Newly planted trees shall be a minimum caliper of three and one-half inches measured 12 inches above ground level and have a minimum mature height of 50 feet. Trees may be reduced in size, subject to a variance and only upon the zoning official making a written determination that an overhead or underground obstruction such as utilities or bedrock, prevent trees of a greater height, and approving an alternate tree size or type, subject to meeting all other street tree requirements.
3.
Street trees shall be planted a maximum of 50 feet on center and spaced equal distance between streetlights and in-line with end stripes of any adjacent parallel parking spaces. New street trees may be planted a greater distance from existing trees, subject to a variance and only upon the mayor and council approving an alternate location and making a written determination that either a new tree should be moved from beneath an existing, healthy tree canopy; or a determination that strictly meeting minimum spacing requirements would be detrimental to the health of a tree; and subject to meeting all other street tree requirements.

New trees installed within the Commercial District shall be 16 feet or taller. Street trees shall be pruned to a minimum height of ten feet above the sidewalk surface at the time of planting when located in the Commercial District.

6.
Tree planting areas and unpaved areas between tree planting areas shall be planted with evergreen ground cover such as Liriope Spicata, Mondo Grass, or other evergreen ground cover with a maximum mature height of 18 inches, as approved by the city. Evergreen shrubs with a maximum mature height of three feet may be planted, when such areas are located adjacent to arterial streets and not adjacent to on-street parking.
7.
Street furniture and trees: Street furniture and pavers where installed, and all street trees, shall have a location and type subject to approval by the city, including but not limited to the following: benches, waste receptacles, tree grates, bicycle racks, newspaper stands and pedestrian lights.

Any pedestrian lights shall be spaced equal distance between street trees.
8.
On-street parking on a narrow street: On narrow local streets where street width is limited, and on-street parking is required or desired, street trees may be provided in landscaped areas located between on-street parking spaces, also known as landscaped bulb-outs, subject to approval by the mayor and council. The minimum planting area within such landscaped bulb-outs shall be 60 square feet.
