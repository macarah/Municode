(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-3.60), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015)
Sec. 16-32. - Variances.
(a)
Authorized variances. Except as further limited herein, an applicant may request a variance from the grading regulations of article II, division 2, the soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control regulations of article II, division 3, the stream buffer regulations of article II, division 4, and the stormwater management regulations of article II, division 5. See section 16-141 for information about variances to flood damage prevention regulations.
(b)
Authority to hear and consider. The zoning board of appeals is authorized to hear variance requests. The zoning board of appeals may not consider or grant variances that are the responsibility of the director of the environmental protection division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and other relevant state statutes and regulations.
(1)
Improvements related to city approved plans. City council is authorized to consider applications for variances to the stream buffer requirements of section 16-78 but not within the 25-foot state buffer zone adjacent to waters of the state as set forth in section 16-59 for city improvements that are part of a city council-approved plan. All public notice requirements as outlined in chapter 27 and all appeal processes as outlined in chapter 16, section 16-34 apply.
(c)
Stream buffer variances. The zoning board of appeals is authorized to consider applications for variances to the stream buffer requirements of section 16-78 but not within the 25-foot state buffer zone adjacent to waters of the state as set forth in section 16-59. Where variances involving the same project are requested from both the state director of the environmental protection division and the community development director, the community development director may not take action on any such request for variance until the state acts on the subject application. Receiving a variance from the director of the environmental protection division does not obligate the zoning board of appeals to permit the project to proceed if the project does not also meet all the other requirements of this chapter. No variance from the provisions of this chapter may be authorized except as expressly authorized in this section or another section of this chapter.
(d)
Applications. Applications for variances authorized in subsection (a) must be made in writing to the community development director and must contain all of materials and documents necessary to demonstrate that the request meets the criteria for granting variances. The community development director must review the variance request and make a recommendation of approval or denial to the zoning board of appeals.
(e)
Decision-making criteria. In considering a request for a variance authorized in subsection (a), the zoning board of appeals must make all of the following findings:
(1)
The request, while not strictly meeting the requirements of this chapter, will be, in the judgment of the zoning board of appeals, at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as would a plan which met the strict application of these requirements. In making such a judgment, the zoning board of appeals must examine whether the request will be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment with regard to the following factors:
a.
Stream bank or soil stabilization;
b.
Trapping of sediment in surface runoff;
c.
Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants from surface runoff;
d.
Terrestrial habitat, food chain, and migration corridor;
e.
Buffering of flood flows;
f.
Infiltration of surface runoff;
g.
Noise and visual buffers;
h.
Downstream water quality; and
i.
Impact on threatened and endangered species, as those species are designated by law or federal or state regulation.
(2)
By reason of exceptional topographic or other relevant physical conditions of the subject property that were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a variance is granted.
(3)
The request does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties that are similarly situated.
(4)
The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located.
(5)
The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this chapter would cause an extreme hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the owner.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-3.70), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2019-02-05, § 1, 2-11-2019)

(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-5.30), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-03-06, § 1, 3-27-2017)
Sec. 16-59. - Regulations.
(a)
Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not expressly exempted by this division must contain provisions for soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. These provisions must be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices must be applied to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, stormwater management facilities, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures must be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. The community development director may require that land-disturbing activities be phased. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans must address appropriate measures to effectively control soil erosion during successive phases of construction.
(b)
Best management practices.
(1)
The best management practices set forth of this section (subsection (b)) and the minimum protections established in subsection (c) are required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design by phases, installation and maintenance of best management practices constitutes a complete defense to any action by the director of the environmental protection division or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained constitutes a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the environmental protection division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters must be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director of the environmental protection division. This section does not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes that are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices constitutes a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the environmental protection division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director of the environmental protection division may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(c)
Protections. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities require, at a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, grading and other development activities must be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential.
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation must be retained, protected and supplemented as provided in article II, division 6.
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements must be kept to a practicable minimum.
(6)
Disturbed soil must be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching must be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices must be installed as soon as practicable.
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this section, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills.
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property.
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners.
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control must include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediment on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2).
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16), there is established a 25-foot state buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director of the environmental protection division approves a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director of the environmental protection division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this section, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that, under normal circumstances, has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, must remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director of the environmental protection division, as provided in this section. The following requirements apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities may be conducted within a buffer and a buffer must remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer does not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented at:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines;
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less must have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director of the environmental protection division may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities may be conducted within a buffer and a buffer must remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer does not apply to stream crossings for water lines or stream crossings for sewer lines, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented at stream crossings for the sewer or water lines.
(d)
Injury to other property. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another does not constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-5.40), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-03-06, § 1, 3-27-2017)
Sec. 16-60. - Land-disturbance permits.
(a)
Required. No person may conduct any land-disturbing activity within the city without first obtaining a land-disturbance permit from the community development director to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent to the environmental protection division, if applicable.
(b)
Review of plans and ordinances. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers must review the general development plans and detailed plans of the Local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They must review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local issuing authority. However, the owner is the only party who may obtain a permit.
(c)
Applications.
(1)
The application for a permit must be submitted to the community development director and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. The plans must include, at a minimum, the data specified in subsection (d). Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans must conform to the provisions of section 16-59. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by eight copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications must contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources.
(2)
A permitting fee, as determined by the city council must be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees may not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees must be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees must be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied must be submitted to the EPD; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) must be submitted in full to the EPD, regardless of the existence of a Local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local issuing authority must refer the application and plan to the soil and water conservation district for its review and approval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The soil and water conservation district must approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the soil and water conservation district to act within 35 days will be construed as an approval of the pending plan. The results of the soil and water conservation district review must be forwarded to the Local issuing authority. No permit may be issued unless the plan has been approved by the soil and water conservation district, all required fees have been paid and any variances required by section 16-59 and any financial guarantees required in accordance with subsection (c)(6) have been obtained. Such a review will not be required if the Local issuing authority and the soil and water conservation district have entered into an agreement which allows the Local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the soil and water conservation district. The Local issuing authority must approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt of a complete application. Failure of the Local issuing authority to take action within this required 35-day period means that the revised plan has been deemed approved by the issuing authority.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the community development director may deny the permit application.
(6)
The community development director may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the community development director may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)

(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-5.50), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-03-06, §§ 1, 2, 3-27-2017)
Sec. 16-61. - Appeals.
The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the city upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions entitles the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section 16-33.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-5.60), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015)
Sec. 16-62. - Enforcement and penalties.
(a)
Enforcement.
(1)
The community development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion, sedimentation and pollution.
(2)
The city must regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees are responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary and tertiary permittees are responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the permittees are conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this division, a written notice to comply must be served upon that person by the community development director. The notice must set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and must state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, that person will be deemed in violation of this division.
(3)
The community development director has the power to conduct any investigations necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this division, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(4)
No person may refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the soil and water conservation commission, or the soil and water conservation district who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor may any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(5)
The soil and water conservation district or the soil and water conservation commission or both may periodically review the actions of the city. The soil and water conservation district or the soil and water conservation commission or both may provide technical assistance to the city for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the city's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The soil and water conservation district or the soil and water conservation commission must notify the EPD and request investigation by the EPD if the city's program is found to be deficient or ineffective.
(6)
The Georgia Board of Natural Resources may promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a Local issuing authority. The EPD may periodically review the actions of the city which has been certified as a Local issuing authority pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include review of the administration and enforcement of the city's ordinances. If such review indicates that the city has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the EPD must notify the city governing authority in writing. Upon receipt of the notification, the governing authority has 90 days to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local issuing authority. If the city does not take necessary action within 90 days after notification by the EPD, the EPD may revoke the certification of the city as a Local issuing authority.
(b)
Penalties.
(1)
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining the permit, the person is subject to revocation of their business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the city.
(2)
Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the community development director or other city authorized representative, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, must be immediately stopped. Such notice must be in writing and must be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person in charge of the activity on the property, and must state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice is required.

For the first and second violations of the provisions of this division on a site, the community development director must issue a written notice of violation. The violator has five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the EPD or the Local issuing authority must issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the EPD or the Local issuing authority must issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning.
b.
For a third and each subsequent violation on a site, the EPD or the Local issuing authority must issue an immediate stop-work order. All stop-work orders are effective immediately upon issuance and remain in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
c.
When a violation in the form of land-disturbance without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the Local issuing authority or by the EPD director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order must be issued by the Local issuing authority or by the EPD director or his designee. All such stop-work orders are effective immediately upon issuance and remain in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Stop-work orders apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
(3)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply must be served by the community development director upon that person. The notice must set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and must state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, they will be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, will be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 16-60. The community development director may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(4)
Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this division, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this division, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the community development director issued as provided in this division, is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of city ordinances, the municipal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought under city ordinances approved under this division is authorized to impose penalties for such violations, not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues constitutes a separate violation.

Stormwater management standards. Subject to the applicability criteria in section 16-91(c) and exemptions in section 16-91(d), the following standards apply:
(1)
Design of stormwater management system: The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the community development director, or designee. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and rules for dam safety as applicable;
(2)
Natural resources inventory: Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicanble):
a.
Topography (min. of 2-foot contours) and steep slopes (slopes >15 percent).
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns.
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressed areas).
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas (such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors).
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing, predominant vegetation, including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation;
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater mangaement. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater funoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable;
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 6, 2020, the applicant may choose either (A) Runoff reduction or (B) Water quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 6, 2020, the applicant shall chose (A) Runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (A) Runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (B) Water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
(A)
Runoff reduction - The stormwater management system shall be designated to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods to the maximum extent practicable.
(B)
Water quality - the stormwater management system shall be designed to removed at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development TSS load from a 1.2 inch rainfall event, or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot, the City of Dunwoody may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site;
(5)
Stream channel protection: Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(6)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection must be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the predevelopment rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided;
(7)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection must be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated;
(8)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream of the site. A downstream peak flow analysis must be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management downstream from the project to a point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin area (GSMM, section 3.1.9). This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need to be given to any planned future upstream land use changes.
(9)
Stormwater system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the City of Dunwoody, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in section 16-92.
(f)
Information required with land development permit pplications. Except as otherwise expressly exempted, land development permit applications must be accompanied by the following information:

The owner shall execute an inspection and maintenance agreement with the City of Dunwoody obligating the owner to inspect, clean, maintain, and repair the stormwater management system, including vegetation in the final BMP landscaping plan. The form of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall be the form provided by the City of Dunwoody. After the inspection and maintenance agreement has been signed by the owner and the City of Dunwoody, the owner shall promptly record such agreement at the owner's cost in the property record for all parcels that make up the site.
(b)
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall identify by name or official title the person(s) serving as the point of contact for carrying out the owner's obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The owner shall update the point of contact from time to time as needed and upon request by the City of Dunwoody. Upon any sale or transfer of the site, the new owner shall notify the City of Dunwoody in writing within 30 days of the name of official title of the new person(s) serving as the point of contact for the new owner. Any failure of an owner to keep the point of contact up to date shall, following 30 days' notice, constitute a failure to maintain the stormwater management system.
(c)
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall run with the land and bind all future successors-in-title of the site. If there is a future sale or transfer of only a portion of the site, then:
(1)
The parties to such sale or transfer may enter into and record an assignment agreement designating the owner responsible for each portion of the site and associated obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement. The parties shall record and provide written notice and a copy of such assignment agreement to the City of Dunwoody.
(2)
In the absence of a recorded assignment agreement, all owners of the site shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the inspection and maintenance agreement regardless of what portion of the site they own.
(3)
As part of the inspection and maintenance agreement, a schedule must be developed for when and how often routine inspection and maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility or practice. The agreement must also include plans for annual inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled maintenance and include remedies for the default thereof.
(4)
The city, in lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this division and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(Ord. No. 2020-11-21, § I, 11-30-2020)
Sec. 16-97. - Design.
(a)
Detention designs. Detention designs may be rejected if they incorporate structures and facilities that will demand considerable maintenance or will be difficult to maintain or will utilize numerous small structures if other alternatives are physically possible.
(b)
Discharge velocities. Discharge velocities from detention facilities must be reduced to provide a nonerosive velocity flow from a structure, channel, or other control measure as set forth in the approved Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(c)
Design storm. The drainage system being developed must have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a 100-year storm event.
(d)
Drainage outfalls. The drainage system from a proposed development must discharge into an outfall that has adequate capacity to accommodate the runoff from the development. If the connecting downstream system is not able to accommodate the allowable design flow from the site, then the design engineer must design on-site drainage facilities that result in no exacerbation of existing downstream conditions.
(e)
Detention storage.
(1)
The live detention storage to be provided must be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The detention system must be adequate for the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the post-development, with a release rate that does not exceed the pre-development release rate during the same duration storm. Detention control structures and other drainage improvements must be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners.
(2)
Detention and sedimentation control facilities may not be placed in any of the following:
a.
Transitional buffer zones as defined by the city zoning ordinance.
b.
Floodplains.
c.
Wetlands.
d.
Stream buffer zones.
e.
State buffer zones.
(3)
Perforated standpipes or a French drain, in accordance with published design standards available from the community development department, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing water and inadequate drainage, must be installed within all the detention and sedimentation control facilities.
(f)
Combined detention. When the applicant requests and the community development director determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention or other stormwater management facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more applicants.
(g)
Fencing.
(1)
Permanent fencing at least four feet in height is required around all stormwater and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater if they have a water storage depth of greater than four feet or they are designated by the city or board of health as a public health hazard.
(2)
Required fencing must be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment into the facility. Fencing must be established on the outside edge of a facility. The fence must include a gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. The gate must be placed in a manner such that the gate does not obstruct reasonable access or become obstructive. The community development director may waive fencing in nonresidential areas where a pond is more than 500 feet from a residential zoning district and in residential zoning districts when detention is provided in natural areas such as stream channels and fencing in the opinion of the community development director would damage the environment or affect stream flow.
(h)
Special flood hazard area elevation contours. In residential districts, not less than 70 percent of the minimum lot area, as established by applicable zoning district development standards, must be above the special flood hazard area elevation contours with the exception that lots in the R-150 district must conform to requirements of the R-100 district.
(i)
Street centerline elevations. The profile elevation of the centerline of all public streets must be constructed a minimum of one foot above special flood hazard area elevation contours. The community development director may grant exceptions to this provision in cases where construction of the street elevation is within a special flood hazard area and elevation contours would improve drainage or reduce the effects of flooding.
(Ord. No. 2020-11-21, § I, 11-30-2020)

Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices.
(e)
Right-of-entry—Maintenance agreements. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement must provide for the right of entry for authorized city or city contracted officials for the purpose of maintenance inspections and other specified purposes. If a site was developed before the requirement to have an inspection and maintenance agreement or an inspection and maintenance agreement was for any reason entered into, recorded, or has otherwise invalidated or deemed insufficient, the City of Dunwoody shall have the right to enter an make inspections pursuant to the City of Dunwoody's general provisions for right of entry in chapter 8 of the Dunwoody Code of Ordinances.
(f)
Maintenance responsibilities.
(1)
Except as otherwise provided in this section, commercial and/or multifamily residential property owner is responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance and certification obligation is binding on all future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
(2)
Stormwater management facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the adoption of the city ordinance assigning maintenance responsibility will not be accepted for city maintenance unless individually approved by and at the discretion of the public works director and suitable access easements are provided. The public works director shall make a decision within 30 days of submittal of the request. The applicant shall be empowered to appeal the decision of the public works director to the mayor and city council, which shall hear the appeal within 30 days of receipt of the appeal.
(g)
Owner's failure to maintain the stormwater management system. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for what constitutes a failure to maintain a stormwater management system and the enforcement options available to the City of Dunwoody. If a site was developed before the requirement to have an inspection and maintenance agreement or an inspection and maintenance agreement was for any reason not entered into, recorded, or has otherwise been invalidated or deemed insufficient, then:
(1)
An owner's failure to maintain the stormwater management system so that it performs as it was originally designed shall be addressed as a violation of, or failure to comply with, owner's property maintenance obligations pursuant to section 8-1 (State Minimum Standard Codes) and
(2)
To address such failure to maintain the stormwater management system, the City of Dunwoody shall have all the powers and remedies that are available to it for other violations of an owner's property maintenance obligations, including, without limitation, prosecution, penalties, abatement, and emergency measure.
If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the public works director, after 30 days' written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24-hour notice is deemed sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The city may assess the owners of the facility for the cost of repair work, which will be a lien on the property, and may be placed on the ad valorem tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes.
(h)
Special drainage system maintenance requirements.
(1)
Pursuant to all applicable city and county law, trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris may not be deposited in any part of the drainage system.
(2)
No restriction or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system or special flood hazard areas without first obtaining a development permit. When on-site or off-site debris has accumulated within a special flood hazard area in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to special flood hazard areas, the community development director must require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water.
(3)
No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre-foot of runoff may be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which may only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the applicant show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties.

(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-8.20), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2018-07-13, § I, 7-23-2018)
Sec. 16-108. - Protected zones.
(a)
Nothing in these regulations may be construed as allowing the removal of vegetation in a natural, undisturbed buffer required by zoning or land development regulations.
(b)
Trees may not be removed from any protected zone. When preserving trees in a protected zone will result in a documented hardship, an appeal may be made to the community development director or the zoning board of appeals, pursuant to section 116-114(c). The documentation proving the hardship must be submitted as part of the tree protection plan and submitted variance application.
(c)
When no trees are present in a protected zone or when it is proposed that any portion of a protected zone be disturbed, it is the responsibility of the owner/developer to landscape the areas (where improvements are not constructed) with trees or other plant materials.
(d)
Trees may not be removed from a floodplain or stream buffer except as follows:
(1)
Those trees found to be hazardous, dead, diseased, or insect-infested by the city arborist as prescribed in section 16-106; and
(2)
As necessary for construction, repair, or maintenance of public roads, utilities, or drainage structures.
(e)
No person shall intentionally or unintentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant, or remove any tree in a stream buffer; attach any rope, wire, nails; allow gaseous liquid or solid substance which is harmful to such trees to come in contact with them; or set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree.
(f)
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-8.30), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-10-19, § I, 10-9-2017; Ord. No. 2018-07-13, § I, 7-23-2018)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-07-13, § I, adopted July 23, 2018, changed the title of § 16-108 from "Tree removal" to read as herein set out.
Sec. 16-109. - Tree replacement and revegetation.
(a)
Applicability. Replacement of trees in the minimum required landscape areas, as determined by this section, must occur under the following conditions:
(1)
To establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site.
(2)
Where grading occurs outside the buildable area of the lot.
(3)
If the buildable area of the lot leaves no protected zone.
(4)
If no trees are present within an existing protected zone.
(5)
Where specimen trees or specimen stands of trees within the buildable portion of the lot are to be removed.
(6)
Where specimen trees or specimen stands of trees, and trees within otherwise designated tree protective zones have been irreparably damaged or removed through development or construction activities.
(b)
Replacement quantity.
(1)
Except as specified for single-family residential lots in subsection (b)(2), the quantity of replacement trees on a site must be sufficient to produce a total site tree density factor of no less than 20 density units per acre (Note: the terms unit and tree are not interchangeable). Procedures for determining the site density requirements and the subsequent tree replacement requirements are provided in appendix A. A required buffer or trees located in the floodplain may not be counted towards tree density. Understory trees may constitute no more than 25 percent of the required replacement trees, but lots smaller than 8,000 square feet in area are exempt from this limit.
(2)
The following number of trees must be planted or preserved on all single-family residential lots developed in the city:
EXPAND
Lot Size Number of Required Trees
≤8,000 square feet 1 tree
8,001 to 15,000 square feet 2 trees
15,001 to 20,000 square feet 3 trees
20,001 to 25,000 square feet 4 trees
25,001 to 30,000 square feet 5 trees
≥30,001 square feet 1 tree per 5,000 square feet of lot size
  (c)
Spacing. The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial limitations, and within responsible considerations towards potential species size.
(d)
Specimen trees. All reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. ("Reasonable effort" includes alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention location and equivalent or similar measures).
(e)
Tree save areas. Tree save areas are encouraged and will be given credit of up to 50 percent individual lot requirements when the number of trees in the tree save areas is equal to or greater than the total number of trees required on the total number of lots within the subdivision.
(f)
Tree replacement fund. Occasionally, the tree replacement requirements of this section cannot be met because a project site will not accommodate the required density of trees. In this case, the city arborist is authorized to approve a contribution to the City of Dunwoody Tree Replacement Fund. The following standards have been established for administering these contributions:
(1)
The city arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance may 100 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question.
(2)
No permit may be issued until the required contribution has been made to the tree replacement fund.
(3)
The amount of the contribution must be determined from the fee schedule for the community development department.
(4)
The City of Dunwoody Tree Replacement Fund must be used for planting trees on public property. Funds may be used for the purchase of trees, installation of trees and irrigation, and the purchase of mulch and soil amendments for the planted areas.
(5)
Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. No single tree species may be used for more than 35 percent of replacement trees. Evergreens may not be used for more than 25 percent of the trees in non-buffer areas. Standards for transplanting and selecting quality replacement stock must be in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture, National Association of Arborists, American Standard for Nursery Stock and appendix B.
(6)
Understory replacement trees may account for no greater than 25 percent of the required tree density units. The city arborist is authorized to approve the additional use of understory trees for meeting density requirements on single-family lots if the size and/or layout of the lot does not allow for large overstory trees.
(7)
Species selection and replacement densities are subject to approval by the city arborist.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-8.40), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-10-19, § I, 10-9-2017)
Sec. 16-110. - Specimen and special trees.
(a)
Criteria. Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen or special trees. The following criteria are used by the city arborist to identify specimen and special trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify.
(1)
Tree size.
EXPAND
Criteria Special Trees Specimen Trees
Minimum size for hardwoods 14" to 23" DBH 24" DBH
Minimum size for softwoods 20" to 29" DBH 30" DBH
Minimum size for understory trees 4" to 5" DBH 6" DBH
Minimum Life Expectancy 25 years 15 years
  (2)
Tree condition.
a.

(b)
Tree density credit. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen and special trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen and special trees which are successfully saved and maintained. Credit for any specimen or special tree thus saved would be one and one-half times the assigned unit value shown in appendix A. Should the property owner retain the services of a certified arborist to improve the quality of the trees (services include, but are not limited to, installation of cabling and bracing, installation of lighting protection, corrective pruning, removal of deadwood, supplemental irrigation, introduction of mycorrhizae, etc.), the density credit will be increased to two times the assigned value designated in appendix A. The property owner must supply a letter of commitment from the certified arborist and/or provide documentation of services provided in order to receive the increased density credit.
(c)
Preservation of tree stands. The city arborist may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one or more specimen or special trees and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed.
(d)
Removal of specimen trees. All specimen trees must be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality with three-inch caliper or larger trees at a density of one and one-half times the unit value of the tree removed; for example, a 30-inch DBH specimen tree (4.9 density units) must be replaced with 7.35 units. Specimen tree replacement density is in addition to the minimum required density for the site.
(1)
Any specimen tree which is fatally damaged during construction, as determined by the city arborist, or removed without the appropriate review and approval of the city arborist, must be replaced with four-inch caliper or larger trees with a total density up to three times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. Additionally, the area that encompassed the critical root zone of the specimen tree must remain undisturbed to allow for the planting of replacement trees.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-8.50), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2018-07-13, § I, 7-23-2018)
Sec. 16-111. - Tree protection measures.
The following minimum tree protection measures must be in place for all tree save areas:
(1)
Tree protection fencing. Trees identified for preservation must have protection fencing that is a minimum of four feet high installed at the edge of the critical root zones. The city arborist is authorized to require the installation of four-foot fencing in those areas where the likelihood of possible encroachment occurs. All tree protection zones must be designated as such with signage posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. Signs requesting workers' cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended at the site entrance(s).
(2)
Silt fences. All tree protection zones must be designed to prevent the sedimentation of erosion material. Silt fences must be placed along the outer uphill edges of tree protection zones at the development interface.
(3)
Encroachment. No person may encroach into the tree protection zones. Construction activities, including but not limited to, parking, vehicle and foot traffic, material storage, concrete washout, debris burning, and other activities must be arranged so as to prevent disturbance within the protected areas.
(4)
Utilities. Reasonable efforts must be made to locate utility lines along corridors between tree protection zones. If utility lines must encroach into the protection zones, they must be installed by tunneling rather than trenching.
(5)
Maintenance of tree protection. All tree protection devices must remain in fully functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued.
a.
Any tree, designated for preservation, which is negligently damaged during construction or removed without the appropriate review and approval, as determined by the city arborist, must be treated in accordance with the National Arborists Association Standards. If fatally damaged, the tree(s) must be replaced with four-inch caliper trees equal to the unit value of the tree removed. Any specimen tree damaged as described above must be replaced with trees equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed.
b.
All tree protection zones must be mulched with at least four inches and not more than eight inches of organic mulch, such as pine straw, wood chips, tree leaves, or compost.
c.
Construction activity is prohibited inside the tree save areas, including but not limited to, grading, paving, and construction of buildings and other structures.
d.
The site must be designed and maintained in a manner to ensure proper drainage in tree save areas during and after construction.
(6)
Tree protection supervisors. The developer must designate a tree protection supervisor. This person must demonstrate knowledge in the area of tree protection practices during construction and must be on-site to ensure tree protection measures are enforced. The tree protection supervisor must participate in a pre-construction conference with the city prior to the commencement of any development. The tree protection supervisor must notify the city arborist immediately should any tree damage occur on the site.
(7)
Inspections. Tree protection inspections must be performed by a certified arborist or registered forester during construction. The inspections must be conducted prior to the commencement of development, immediately following the clearing and grubbing phase, immediately following the grading phase, and at the end of the project before a certificate of occupancy (commercial developments) is issued or the final plat approved (residential developments). The site must be inspected to ensure all tree protection regulations are being met and to identify any existing or developing tree-related problems that require treatment. An inspection report must be prepared and certified by the inspector and submitted to the city arborist. Any damage noted must be treated in accordance with the recommendation of the inspector prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval of the final plat. The city arborist is authorized to require additional reports should he/she determine significant construction damage has occurred, the tree protection supervisor has failed to enforce minimum protection standards, or if other development processes, including but not limited to utility placement and building construction, may impact the tree save areas.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-14, 1(Exh. A § 16-8.60), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-10-19, § I, 10-9-2017)
Sec. 16-112. - Maintenance.
All maintenance activities performed on preserved or planted trees to be included in the tree density requirements must be performed in accordance with the most current professional standards, including, but not limited to, the standards described below. It is the responsibility of the property owner to ensure such work is in compliance. Should maintenance activities on the trees not be in compliance with such professional standards, the property owner will be responsible for replacing the damaged trees with new trees of an equivalent density value, based on the DBH at the time damage occurs.
(1)
Nursery stock. All nursery stock must meet standards defined in the American Standard for Nursery Stock ANSI Z60.(1).
(2)
Pruning. All pruning must be done in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 1) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Pruning. Tree topping is not allowed. Crown reduction pruning must be used instead to reduce the height of a tree when necessary. Topped trees may not be counted toward tree density requirements.
(3)
Fertilization. All tree fertilization must be performed in accordance with ANSI A 300 (Part 2) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Fertilization.
(4)
Cabling and bracing. All cabling and bracing installation and maintenance must be performed in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 3) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Cabling and Bracing.
(5)
Lightning protection. All lightning protection installation and maintenance must be performed in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 4) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Lightning Protection.
(6)
Safety. All tree-related work must be performed in accordance with ANSI Z13(3)1 Standards for Tree Care Operations—Safe Work Practices.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-10-16, adopted Oct. 8, 2018, amended div. 8 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 8, §§ 16-136—16-141 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2013-10-14, § 1(Exh. A §§ 16-10.10—16-10.60), adopted Oct. 14, 2013; and Ord. No. 2015-01-04, § 1, adopted Jan. 26, 2015.

Sec. 16-136. - General.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effects of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to flood damage and loss.
(b)
Purposes. It is the purpose of the flood damage prevention regulations of this division to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
(7)
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area; and
(8)
Ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions.
(c)
Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this division includes methods and provisions to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(d)
Applicability. The flood damage prevention regulations of this division apply to all areas within the City of Dunwoody.
(e)
Compliance. All structures and land may hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered only in full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations.
(f)
Violations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) constitutes a violation of this chapter. Any person who violates the flood damage prevention regulations of this division or who fails to comply with any of its requirements will, upon conviction, be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment in accordance with section 1-6 of the municipal code. Each day such violation continues is a separate offense. The city council may take any other lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. See also the general enforcement provisions of section 16-35.
(g)
Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas.
(1)
The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administration of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the flood insurance study dated June 15, 1994, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps dated June 15, 1994, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this division.
(2)
The flood insurance study and accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps depict the minimum area of applicability of this division and may be supplemented by studies for other areas that allow implementation of this division and that are recommended to the city council by the floodplain coordinator.
(3)
Examples of other studies that may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the 100-year floodplain and floodprone areas include:
a.
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency; or
b.
Any base flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia that has been prepared by FEMA-approved methodology and approved by the community development director.
(4)
Examples of other studies that may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and floodprone areas include:
a.
Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency; or
b.
Any future-conditions flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia that has been prepared by FEMA-approved methodology approved by the community development director.
(h)
Repetitive loss structure and cumulative substantial damage. A building must be brought into compliance with requirements for new construction if it has incurred flood-related damages on two or more occasions during a ten-year period in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on average, was 25 percent or more of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event, or if damage of any origin is sustained and the cost of restoring the building to its pre-damage condition is 50 percent or more of the market value of the building before the damage occurred.
(i)
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This division does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This division does not create liability on the part of the city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this division or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. No. 2018-10-16, § II, 10-8-2018)
Sec. 16-139. - Standards for development.
(a)
Floodplain boundaries.
(1)
Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, must be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
(2)
For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations must be provided by the community development director. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the city, then it must be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the community development director.
(b)
Floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway must be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the floodway must be provided by the community development director. If floodway data is not available from the city, then it must be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the community development director.
(c)
General standards.
(1)
No development is allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation by 0.01 foot or more;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or,
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(2)
Any development that is allowed within the future-conditions floodplain pursuant to the preceding paragraph (1) must also comply with the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity must occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and must be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case may any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas must be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
c.
Effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics must be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection (d);
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, must be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and
f.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain must be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal is subject to approval by the community development director using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The applicant is responsible for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant must submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 16-140 apply. This study must be prepared by a registered professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information must be submitted to and approved by the community development director before the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. The study must include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the community development director. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information must be obtained whenever available. Computations must be shown duplicating FIS results and must then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
The study must include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which clearly defines all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within special flood hazard areas are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increasing flood heights. Therefore the following provisions apply within floodways:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the floodway, except for activities expressly allowed in the following paragraph (2).
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide the required supporting technical data and certification of the findings.
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway may be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the community development director.
(f)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner is responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the subject property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The community development director is authorized to direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the community development director.

(Ord. No. 2018-10-16, § II, 10-8-2018)
Sec. 16-141. - Variances.
(a)
Nature of variance.
(1)
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this division would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
(2)
It is the duty of the city to help protect citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance procedures provided in this division are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(b)
Factors for consideration.
(1)
In passing upon requests for variances, the zoning board of appeals must consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this division, and the:
a.
Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b.
Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c.
Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
d.
Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e.
Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
f.
Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
g.
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h.
Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i.
Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j.
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
k.
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(2)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted must be given written notice over the signature of the community development director that:
a.
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and
b.
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice must be recorded by the floodplain coordinator in the office of the clerk of county superior court in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(3)
The floodplain coordinator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(c)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(2)
Variances may not be issued within any mapped floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(3)
Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. The term "minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the zoning board of appeals need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the zoning board of appeals believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. Variances may only be issued upon:
a.
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(4)
Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this section (subsection (c)) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(5)
Variances may not be issued "after the fact."
(6)
Upon consideration of the factors in subsection (b) and the purposes of this division, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division.
(d)
Appeals of zoning board of appeals' decisions. Any person aggrieved by a flood damage prevention variance or appeal decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal the decision to the county superior court by petition for a writ of certiorari pursuant to state law.
