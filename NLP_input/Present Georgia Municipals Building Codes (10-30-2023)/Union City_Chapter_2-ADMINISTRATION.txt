Sec. 2-94. - Employee drug policy.
(a)
Purpose. The mayor and council finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, use, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The mayor and council further finds that the use of alcohol during or prior to working hours is prohibited where alcohol can be measured at the level of .02 grams during working hours, said level being presumptively adverse to the safety of the workplace. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this city, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, use, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs; and further to take all reasonable steps to eradicate the use of alcohol where a level of .02 grams exists, such level adversely affecting the safety of the workplace. With this purpose in mind, the mayor and council declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, use, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner; and from any person whose use of alcohol results in a level of .02 grams during working hours. For this reason, and pursuant to Chapter 23 of Title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the mayor and council enacts this section.
(b)
Definitions. As used in this section the term:
City means Union City, Georgia.
City employee means any person employed by the city.
Controlled substance means any drug, substance, or immediate precursor included in Schedules I through V of O.C.G.A. sections 16-13-25 through 16-13-29 and Schedules I through V of 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1308.

Any city employee in possession of, selling, distributing, trafficking or manufacturing any controlled substance shall be in violation of this policy.
(d)
Prescription drugs. Any city employee under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and who is requested to undergo drug testing, shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, prior to the testing, if that employee is currently taking the prescribed medication. Any person who has been offered employment with the city in a position that has been designated as high risk, and is under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and is currently taking the prescribed medication, shall notify the human resources director, prior to the mandatory preemployment testing.
(e)
Random drug testing. Due to the potential serious consequences of a city employee attempting to perform his/her job functions while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, all safety sensitive city employees are subject to random drug/alcohol testing. Nonsensitive city employees, as listed in (a) above, under the definition for "safety sensitive employees", may also volunteer to participate in the random drug testing. Volunteer participation in the random drug testing may be accomplished by the nonsensitive employee submitting a signed and notarized certificate to their department head, who will approve the voluntary participation in writing and forward the completed certificate to the human resources director for enclosure in the employee's personnel folder. All persons who have been offered employment with the city must undergo drug/alcohol testing as a precondition to employment. All employees are subject to the same disciplinary measures contained in this article for their refusal to undergo the testing.
(f)
Reasonable suspicion. Any city employee who demonstrates an unexplained inability to perform his/her normal job functions safely or productively, and/or exhibits characteristics consistent with the use of a controlled substance or alcohol (e.g., slurred speech, unsteady gait, etc.) will be required to undergo a drug/alcohol test to determine whether or not a violation of this policy has occurred. Whenever any supervisor detects any evidence of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances in the work place, such evidence shall constitute reasonable suspicion that an employee is in violation of this policy.
(g)
Procedures for reasonable suspicion drug/alcohol testing. Any supervisor who has reason to believe an employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, in a nonemergency situation, shall contact the city administrator, or his/her designee, to obtain approval prior to requesting the employee to undergo the testing. In a nonemergency situation, one (1) or more additional supervisors shall observe the employee to corroborate that reasonable suspicion exists warranting a drug/alcohol test.
The employee shall be requested by the supervisor to undergo a drug/alcohol test. If the employee should refuse to submit to the testing, disciplinary measures shall be taken against the employee, ranging from a minimum five-day suspension from work without pay up to and including termination, for refusing to submit to the testing and for insubordination. The next time a supervisor requests the employee to undergo a drug/alcohol test based upon the supervisor's suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, if the employee should refuse to submit to the testing the employee will be terminated.
The employee, after consenting to the testing, shall be transported by the city to the testing facility. Following the test, the employee shall be suspended with pay pending an investigation and the test results. If the test results are positive, the employee will be afforded an opportunity to explain. If no justifiable explanation exists, disciplinary action will be taken up to and including termination. If the test is negative, the supervisor will explain this to the employee and the employee will be assured that this matter has been concluded and nothing will be placed in the employee's personnel file. The employee will then immediately assume his/her job responsibilities.
(h)
Confidential information. Information concerning suspected controlled substance use and testing results shall be placed in locked files separate from the routine personnel files. Such information shall be communicated only to those individuals who need to know the information in order to perform their job functions.

(k)
Last chance policy. If, prior to an arrest for an offense involving a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug, a city employee notifies the city that the employee illegally uses a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug and is receiving or agrees to receive treatment under a drug abuse treatment and education program licensed under O.C.G.A. Chapter 5 of Title 26 and approved by the city, the employee shall be entitled to maintain city employment for up to one (1) year as long as the employee follows the treatment plan. During this period, the city employee shall not be separated from city employment solely on the basis of the employee's drug dependence, but the employee's work activities may be restructured if practicable to protect persons or property.
No statement made by an employee to a supervisor of the city employee or other person in order to comply with this section shall be admissible in any civil, administrative, or criminal proceeding as evidence against the city employee. The rights granted by this code section shall be available to a city employee only once during a five-year period and shall not apply to any city employee who has refused to be tested or who has tested positive for a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug.
