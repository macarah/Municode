Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Accessory structures are not exempt from requirements of this chapter. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not however include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications that are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions that have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 2010-0412, § I, 4-12-10)
Sec. 42-82. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 42-81(4).
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two and seven-tenths feet above base flood elevation.
(2)
Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE or AH zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 42-48(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See subsection 42-81(6).)
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
2.
Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section;
3.
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-7 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification.
b.
Only if subsection (4)a. is satisfied, any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.
c.
The placement of manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection 42-81(6) are met, and the elevation standards of subsection 42-82(1) and the encroachments standards of subsection (4)a. of this section are met.
d.
Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in calculating the effect of proposed encroachment on flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(5)
Floodway fringe, lower. Within the lower floodway fringe is the area between the floodway and the upper floodway fringe that is lower than one-half the distance between the floodway and the boundary of the area of special flood hazard. The lower floodway fringe is a transitional area that is hazardous due to its proximity to the floodway and encroachment by fill or development within this area could have serious impact on the entire floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the lower floodway fringe:
a.
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer, with supporting technical data, is provided to the director demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
b.
If subsection 42-81(4)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 42-81.
c.
The placement of manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection 42-81(6), and the elevation standard of subsection 42-81(1), and the encroachment standards of subsection 42-82(4)a. are met.
d.
