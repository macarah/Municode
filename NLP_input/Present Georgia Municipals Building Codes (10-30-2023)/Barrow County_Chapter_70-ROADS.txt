ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 70-1—70-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - DISPOSSESSORIES

Sec. 70-31. - The intent of the article.
It is the intent of this article to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public in the county by providing the means by which personalty of dispossessed tenants will be removed from the county's right-of-way if otherwise left thereon for a period in excess of 24 hours.
(Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1)
Sec. 70-32. - Dispossessory bond required.
Upon the receipt of a writ of possession issued by the court for execution, the sheriff or his/her designee shall inquire of the property owner, landlord, or his agent, if, in addition to placing the property owner or landlord in possession of the premises, the property owner or landlord desires the personalty of the tenant removed to the county's right-of-way. If the answer is affirmative, the sheriff shall inform the property owner or landlord that he/she is required to post a cash bond with county sheriff's office in the amount of $500.00.
(Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1; Res. of 2-24-2004)
Sec. 70-33. - Property deemed to be abandoned.
Property which has been set on the right-of-way of the county and remains there for a period in excess of 24 hours shall be presumed abandoned unless prior arrangements for claiming the property by the owner, his/her heirs or assigns has been received by the county sheriff's office. Such abandoned property shall be deemed a hazard and detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public in the county.
(Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1; Res. of 2-24-2004)
Sec. 70-34. - Disposition of abandoned property.
(a)
Whenever it is brought to the attention of the county that abandoned property, within the meaning of the preceding section exists on the right-of-way, the sheriff's office shall attempt to ascertain the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the property. If such information is known, the owner of the property shall be contacted and advised to immediately abate the hazard by removing the property from the right-of-way.
(b)
In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant is set on the county's right-of-way at the insistence of the property owner or landlord, and such property thereafter is presumed abandoned, the property owner or landlord at his or her own expense shall cause the personalty to be removed from the county's right-of-way.
(c)
If the owner of the abandoned property cannot be located and contacted, and if the property owner or landlord fails to remove the abandoned property, the county may abate the hazard without the prior approval of the property owner. The county is authorized to use county work crews, private contractors, or any inmate labor within the county to abate the hazard by removing the abandoned property to the county landfill.
(Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1; Res. of 2-24-2004)
Sec. 70-35. - Claim against dispossessory bond.
In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant remains on the county's right-of-way for a period in excess of 24 hours, and is therefore deemed abandoned by the owner, the property owner or landlord at his own expense shall cause the personalty to be removed from the county's right-of-way. In the event the property owner or landlord fails to remove the personalty within the time prescribed, the county may cause such personalty to be removed to the county landfill, and thereafter assert a claim against the dispossessory bond posted by the property owner or landlord to cover the expenses of removal and disposal of the abandoned property. In the further event the property owner or landlord has not posted a bond as required by this article, or that bond is not sufficient to cover the expenses of removing and disposing of the abandoned property, and such expenses have not been paid in full to the county 30 days after the property has been removed, a lien may be placed against the realty from which the abandoned property was removed, and thereafter foreclosed in the same manner as special liens on real estate by laborers in accordance with applicable [State of] Georgia laws.
(Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1; Res. of 2-24-2004)
Sec. 70-36. - Additional remedies.
It is the intent of this section to provide an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance with the removal of personalty of dispossessed tenants from the county's right-of-way. Nothing contained in this section shall abrogate the right of the tenant to remove their personalty from the county's right-of-way, nor of the property owner or landlord to remove such personalty and thereafter proceed against the tenants for the recovery of expenses incurred.

(Ord. of 11-15-2013)
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted November 15, 2013, set out provisions not specifically amendatory of the Code. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as § 70-77.
ARTICLE IV. - SPEED CONTROL DEVICES PROGRAM

Sec. 70-80. - Purpose.
new
This article has been established for the citizens of Barrow County who want to pursue the installation of speed control devices in their neighborhoods. The program provides property owners a process to install speed control devices on county-maintained roads where engineering studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by a majority of the property owners in the neighborhood.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-81. - Petition process.
new
To have speed control devices considered for installation on county-maintained neighborhood roads, a petition must be submitted to the transportation division of the public works department.
(a)
Contact transportation division for petition paperwork.
(b)
For subdivisions not built out or complete, a minimum of 60 percent of the total units must be occupied before a petition may be considered.
(c)
All property owners in the subdivision should be contacted and given the opportunity to sign the petition, indicating their "yes" or "no" concerning the installation of speed control devices.
(d)
Only the signature of the legal owner of the property will be proper for the purposes of the petition.
(e)
All property owners must sign individually, including the owners of undeveloped lots.
(f)
If a property is jointly owned by a married couple, both signatures are required (e.g. a "Mr. & Mrs." signature is not acceptable).
(g)
Multiple owners must all indicate a "yes" on the petition in order for a "yes" vote to count for that lot.
(h)
Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner.
(i)
Each lot counts as one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing.
(j)
At least 80 percent of the property owners must be in favor of speed control devices for petitions to be considered.
(k)
The completed petition must be submitted to the Transportation Division of the Public Works Department, where it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure that it meets all requirements.
(l)
For petitions that do meet the requirements, the Transportation Division will conduct a preliminary field inspection to consider the road geometry. If the street, grade, and other fixed factors do not meet the necessary requirements for consideration of speed control devices, the initial request will fail and no further action will be taken. If the street, grade, and other fixed factors qualify for the Speed Control Devices Program, a traffic engineering study will be conducted to determine whether the subject street meets the criteria for the installation of speed control devices.
(m)
In the case of a petition that fails to meet the requirements set forth herein, property owners must wait one year from the date of the initial request before requesting another study of the same street(s).
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-82. - Eligibility.
new
The use of speed control devices is limited to residential streets where excessive speeding can be documented.
(a)
Only streets that are within residential subdivisions and classified as local streets (<4000 vehicles per day) are eligible for installation of speed control devices.
(b)
A traffic study by a firm or individual competent and qualified to perform such study shall be required and such findings must show that a speeding problem exists based on the standard of an 85 th percentile speed of at least 11 mph over the posted speed limit of 25 mph.
(c)
A preliminary field investigation performed by the transportation division prior to the traffic study may find that speed control devices are not warranted due to existing conditions such as but not limited to horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distance, length and width of roadway.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-83. - Approval process.
new
(a)
If the traffic study finds that speed control devices are warranted, the findings will be presented to the board of commissioners for consideration.
(b)
A public hearing will take place prior to the presentation to allow for public comments.
(c)
The board of commissioners shall take into account traffic study findings, public comments, and staff presentation for final approval of the installation of speed control devices on the street or street section in question.
(d)
After approval, reasonable effort will be made for installation in a timely manner, typically four to six months.
(e)
Speed control devices shall be installed only by the county or its designated contractor; property owners within a subdivision cannot install speed control devices.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-84. - Cost.
new
Implementation of the speed control devices program shall be cost/revenue neutral to the county in that each respective property owner(s) shall be responsible for the pro-rata share of cost of said installation and upkeep and the county shall not incur any charge. Such costs shall include but are not limited to:
(a)
The initial traffic study by engineering firm;
(b)
Purchase of speed control device product/material and corresponding labor;
(c)
Signage and markings; and
(d)
Any maintenance.
The county will create a special assessment district which will consist of those properties that are located within the residential subdivision of the proposed speed control devices. If the installation of speed control devices is approved, the initial cost of installation, including the traffic study, all materials, signage, markings, and labor, will be assessed as a one-time charge divided among all the lots in the special assessment district. Thereafter, an annual fee for the maintenance of speed control devices shall be $20.00 per year per each lot located in the special assessment district.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-85. - Criteria for location and type.
new
Transportation division personnel will plan the type and placement of speed control devices based on the streets meeting program requirements using the following guidelines:
(a)
Grade. Speed control devices should not be installed on street sections with grades greater than eight percent.
(b)
Number of speed control devices in a series. Speed control devices are not to be used to slow traffic at a given "point," but rather to reinforce a safe speed along a street or street section. For this reason, a single speed control device is not recommended. Usually, a series of speed control devices should not exceed three-quarters of a mile. If the street or street section to be treated exceeds a mile, speed control devices can be used in conjunction with other traffic calming devices, such as traffic circles, thus reducing the number of speed control devices necessary to achieve targeted speed reduction.
(c)
Spacing. Research indicates that spacing speed control devices between 300 and 500 feet apart is most effective at lowering the 85 th percentile speed to the targeted speed range.
(d)
Location. The first speed control device in a series should normally be located in a position where it cannot be approached at high speed from either direction. To achieve this objective, the first speed control device in a series is typically installed within 100 and 200 feet of a small-radius curve or stop sign. Care should be taken so that speed control devices are not planned with conflict with utility access, manhole covers, and driveway cuts.
(e)
Type. The county shall only install that certain type of speed control device which is capable of being removed and does not disqualify the county from receiving local assistance funds or other such funds in terms of resurfacing such roads.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
Sec. 70-86. - Removal.
new
The removal of speed control devices may proceed or occur if the County is presented with a petition requesting that the speed control devices be removed.
(a)
At least 80 percent of the property owners must vote in favor of removing the speed control devices; and
(b)
The petition must be signed by the property owners in accordance with the criteria described in items A — I of the petition process section above.
(c)
Such a petition will only be considered after speed control devices have been in place for a period of at least one year after final installation.
(d)
If approved, the cost of removal will be paid using previously collected annual maintenance fees.
(e)
All previously paid maintenance fees are non-refundable upon removal.
(f)
The county reserves the authority to remove the speed control devices at any time for reasons of safety, changes in: regulatory requirements, laws, guidelines and any new construction.
(Ord. of 2-8-2022, § 1(Exh. A))
