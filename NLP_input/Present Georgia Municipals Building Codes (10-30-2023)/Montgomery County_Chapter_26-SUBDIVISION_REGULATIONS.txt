(1)
Review of Sketch Plan by the governing authority.
(2)
Review of Final Development Plan by the governing authority.
(b)
It is recommended that developers considering subdivision or mobile home park development seek a predevelopment review by the Montgomery County Health Department prior to beginning work on their development plan.
(Ord. of 8-2-2005(2), § 6.1)
Sec. 26-24. - Requirements for submission of Development Plan.
A Final Development Plan shall not be submitted for review until the developer or his agent has obtained review and approval from the following:
(1)
The Montgomery County Health Department shall review the water supply and sewage disposal facilities to be provided on all development plans after being provided with such percolation tests or other information as it may require. In addition, it shall make determinations in all matters concerning the public health, as specified herein. Such determinations and recommendations shall be in writing and accompany the Final Development Plan. Regardless of individual lot sizes within a development, a developer shall be required to provide the Health Department with a soil map and soil descriptions based on high intensity soil study conducted in compliance with the Department of Human Resources' current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems. Prior to granting approval of a Final Development Plan, the Montgomery County Health Department shall confirm the availability of land area sufficient to meet the minimum lot size requirements set forth in section 26-26.

c.
All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground where practicable.
d.
If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point.
e.
All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long.

(2)
All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.

(j)
Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly a right angle as practicable.
