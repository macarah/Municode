ARTICLE VIII. - ETHICS

Sec. 2-170. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials is adopted.
(b)
This Code has the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts and actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city;
(3)
To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in manners that affect the city; and
(4)
To service as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by it terms.
(c)
The provisions of this article shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports of regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.

The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, state law and the charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this article. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the charter.

Such panel shall elect one of its members as the chairman and set an initial hearing to be held not later than 15 days after their appointment.

The panel shall determine the merit of a complaint by examining the following criteria:

The city clerk shall forward the meritorious complaint to the members of the board within five days of its appointment.

ARTICLE IX. - PROCUREMENT[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 04-2014, adopted February 24, 2014, set out provisions intended for use as a new article VII, §§ 2-170—2-2-176. For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as a new article IX, §§ 2-190—2-196.

Sec. 2-190. - Definitions.

Responsible bid or proposal means a person or entity that has the capability in all respects to perform fully and reliably the contract requirements.
Responsive bid or proposal means a person or entity who has submitted a bid or proposal that conforms in all material respects to the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids or request for proposals.

Sec. 2-191. - Purchasing agent.
The city manager, or some other employee or city official appointed by the city council shall be the city purchasing agent.
( Ord. No. 04-2014, 2-24-2014 )
Sec. 2-192. - Scope of coverage.
(a)
All purchasing, leasing or contracting for equipment, materials and supplies shall be governed by this article. Contracts for services, where feasible, should be competitively bid upon written specifications approved by the city manager; provided, however, it is recognized that the ability to render certain services, particularly those of learned professionals, are often unique to an individual contractor and are incapable of competitive bidding. All contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney as to legal form, approved by the city council and spread upon the minutes of the city council's meeting at which approval was granted. All contracts shall be executed in the manner and with the requisite formalities set forth in the City Charter or other applicable law.
(b)
Repairs and general maintenance, where feasible, should be competitively bid; however, certain equipment, systems and facilities can only be repaired or serviced through authorized service centers or by specially trained personnel who do not engage in bidding. The public interest is best served by maintaining such equipment, systems and facilities in accordance with manufacturer's requirements and warranties. For this reason, such services may be obtained without first obtaining bids as generally required by this article.
(c)
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. 13-10-91, all contracts for the physical performance of services within this state, to be binding on and enforceable against the city, shall require the contractor to register and participate in the federal work authorization program to verify work eligibility of all newly hired employees and subcontractors. Before a bid for any such service is considered by the city, the bid shall include a signed, notarized affidavit from the contractor attesting to the following:
(1)
The affiant has registered with and is authorized to use the federal work authorization program;
(2)
The user identification number and date of authorization for the affiant; and
(3)
The affiant is using and will continue to use the federal work authorization program throughout the contract period.
No contractor or subcontractor under contract with the city in connection with the physical performance of services within this state shall be entitled to payment from public funds for its services unless such contractor or subcontractor registers and participates in the federal work authorization program. It shall be deemed a breach of contract for any contractor, or subcontractor thereof, who physically performs services within this state under a contract with the city, to fail or refuse to participate in the federal work authorization program throughout the term of such contract. It shall be the duty of the contractor and/or subcontractor(s) to maintain records of federal work authorization verification for all newly hired employees for the term of the contract and to maintain such records for not less than three years from the contract's date of final completion. Such records shall be considered an open public record and made available to the city upon request or in the event of contract audit by a federal or state agency; provided, however, any information in such record protected from public disclosure by federal or state law shall be redacted.

Sec. 2-193. - Procurement of equipment, materials, and supplies.
(a)
The city manager, in his discretion may delegate to the department manager the procurement of equipment, materials, and supplies having a gross or combined cost of less than $2,500.00; provided, however, purchases shall not be subdivided in an effort to evade the limitations of this section. Where feasible, whenever like purchases are required by more than one department, the purchasing agent shall consolidate purchase orders to receive full advantage of available quantity discounts.
(b)
Insofar as it is practical for procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies having an estimated cost of more than $2,500.00 and less than $10,000.00, no less than three businesses shall be solicited to submit quotations, which shall be written where practical. Award shall be made to the business submitting the lowest responsive, responsible quotation. The names of the businesses submitting quotations, and the date and amount of each quotation, shall be recorded and maintained as a public record. The city clerk will provide a form to be used to summarize the quotations in a uniform manner. Purchases of less than $10,000.00 shall be approved, in writing, by the mayor or city manager.
(c)
All other procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies having an estimated cost of more than $10,000.00 shall be competitively bid upon written specifications drawn by the department manager in consultation with, and as approved by, the purchasing agent. The manner of advertisement or bid solicitation (including the pre-qualification of potential vendors), the period bid solicitations remain open, and procedures governing bidding and bid openings shall be approved, in writing, by the city manager. ALL REQUESTS FOR PROCUREMENT SHALL BE ISSUED WITH RESERVATION OF THE CITY'S RIGHT TO REJECT ALL BIDS; TO REBID UPON READVERTISEMENT (WITH OR WITHOUT MODIFIED SPECIFICATIONS); OR, IN CASES WHERE ALL BIDS RECEIVED FAIL TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS, TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIDDER WHOSE PRODUCT COMES CLOSEST TO MEETING SPECIFICATIONS. Purchases of $10,000.00 or more shall be approved by the city council in a duly convened public meeting.
(d)
The lowest responsive, responsible bid shall be approved. Where the lowest bid is not responsive or the bidder is not deemed responsible, written documentation shall be maintained explaining why the lowest bid was rejected. Where the amount of purchase is less than $10,000.00 the city manager shall determine rejection of the lowest bid; where the amount of purchase is $10,000.00 or more, rejection of the lowest bid shall be determined by the city council.
(e)
In determining the lowest responsive, responsible bid or quotation, a preference of up to five percent or $250.00, whichever is least, may be given to manufacturers, distributors, materialmen and suppliers having local business addresses within the 30220 zip code area. Otherwise, as far as may be reasonable and practicable without sacrificing price or quality, preference may be given to Georgia suppliers over out-of-state suppliers. A similar preference may be given to American suppliers over foreign suppliers.
(f)
The requirements of this section shall not be applicable to the purchase of equipment, material, and supplies when the city manager has determined the procurement of such item(s) is only available from a sole source.
(g)
The requirements of this section shall not apply when procurement of equipment, material, and supplies is available through federal or state bulk purchasing programs, intergovernmental contracts, and similar cooperative buying services in which the city participates (including, but not limited to: the department of administrative services, Georgia Correctional Industries, Electric Cities of Georgia, and GMA programs).
( Ord. No. 04-2014, 2-24-2014 )
Sec. 2-194. - Emergency purchases.
If not feasible to call an emergency meeting of the city council, the city manager shall be authorized to approve the purchase of equipment, materials and supplies, without obtaining competitive bids, during any emergency situation affecting the health, safety or general welfare of the city and its operations, upon the concurrence of the mayor or, in his absence, the mayor pro tem.
( Ord. No. 04-2014, 2-24-2014 )
Sec. 2-195. - Budgetary constraints.

(b)
All public works construction contracts entered into by the City of Grantville with private persons or entities shall be in writing and on file in the city manager's office, available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours. All public works construction contracts shall be executed and entered in the manner and with the formalities required by the City Charter and other applicable laws.
(c)

(d)
The requirements of this section shall apply to all public works construction projects having an estimated cost of $25,000.00 or more, except that these requirements shall not apply to projects necessitated by an emergency; provided, the nature of the emergency shall be found and described in the minutes of the city council.

The requirements of this section shall not apply to sole source public works construction projects when the city council, by resolution in a duly convened public meeting, has found and concluded that competitive procurement is not available or otherwise not feasible.
