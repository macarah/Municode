DIVISION 2. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 10-44. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.

As to adult dance establishments, this section represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

(7)
The Hearing Officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee and the licensee's attorney, with a copy to the City Attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing.
