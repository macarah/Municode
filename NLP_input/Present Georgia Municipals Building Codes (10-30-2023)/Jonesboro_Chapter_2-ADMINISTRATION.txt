DIVISION 2. - HUD PROCUREMENT POLICY[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Nov. 13, 2000, enacted provisions codified herein as Ch. 2, Art. V, Div. 2, §§ 2-181—2-190. In order to maintain Code format, the existing sections of Art. V were redesignated as Div. 1 at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-181. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to create a stand alone procurement policy setting forth standards acceptable to the federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department for application when federal HUD monies are received and used by the city.
(Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-1))
Sec. 2-182. - Limitations of division.
This division is to be used for procurement only when the funding source for the procurement are federal HUD monies, HUD grants or other HUD asset devices or awards.
(Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-2))
Sec. 2-183. - Conflict of laws.
This division is designed to comply with Section 85.36, Procurement, of the HUD standards for procurement found in 24 CFR Subtitle A (4-1-00 Edition). If any conflict arises between this division and Section 85.36, the more restrictive policy shall apply.
(Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-3))
Sec. 2-184. - Award protests.
(a)
The city as adopted below establishes protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the city.
(b)
If an interested bidder or proposal submitting party protests the award of a bid or proposal the party shall submit such protest in writing within 30 days of the award of the bid or proposal to the city clerk.
(c)
The protest must specify what violation of this division occurred and the factual basis for the allegation. The grounds for a protest shall be limited to allegations of factual error or that the bid or proposal was not accepted for personal, political, racial, or religious reasons.
(d)
The protest must be issued by the party under oath or affirmation.
(e)
Within 60 days of the protest the procurement board shall determine if the protest complies with this division. If the protest does not comply the parties will be notified in writing and provided a recitation of deficiencies. The party may then resubmit a protest. All protest resubmittals must comply with the time limit set forth in subsection (b).
(f)
Once a complete protest is submitted the mayor and council shall convene an administrative hearing of a procurement board of three city citizens who have resided in the city for at least six months.
(g)
A protest hearing is a quasi-judicial proceeding. As such, it should be conducted at a place conducive to the maintenance of a judicial atmosphere. At the hearing, the conduct of the parties shall be dignified, both on and off the record.
(h)
Misconduct before the procurement board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges which led to the protest. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the procurement board.
(i)
The procurement board shall not be advocates for or against either party. The procurement board may be appointed independent council for the purposes of investigating and/or refusing the protest. It shall be the duty of the procurement board to be impartial in its conduct and rulings, both on and off the record. The protestors and mayor and council may examine, call and question witnesses and may call for and introduce appropriate documentary evidence, being limited only by the relevance of the evidence to the issues.
(j)
It should be recognized that the procurement board may be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable. It shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues.
(k)
Each protest shall be heard by the board at the earliest practicable date following the receipt of a compliant protest.
(l)
The city clerk shall send out a written notice of the time, date and place of the hearing. This notice shall be sent to the protestor and/or his authorized representative.
(m)
The general policy of the board concerning postponements shall be that cases set for hearings will be heard on the dates set, and that postponements will be granted only for good cause. Postponement of the opening date of a hearing shall be at the discretion of the chairman of the board.
(n)
If deemed appropriate to the circumstances of the case, protestor or board may arrange a prehearing conference prior to the hearing in order to consider and determine the following elements:
(1)
Simplification of the issues.
(2)
Possible conciliation and settlement without a hearing.
(3)
Limitation on the number of witnesses.
(4)
Acceptance of evidence of deposition.
(5)
Stipulation as to any uncontested facts.
(6)
Other matters that may aid in the disposition of the appeal.
(o)
An electronic recording of transactions may be made during prehearing conferences upon request of either party at interest.
(p)
The chairman of the board shall administer the oath to witnesses. In the event that a prehearing conference has not limited the number of witnesses and the number of witnesses asked for seems to be excessive, in the discretion of the board the party requesting them may be required to justify his request before the board. The board may decline to listen to numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts. The board, through the city clerk, may subpoena witnesses, documents and records as necessary.
(q)
A protestor appearing before the procurement board may, if desired, be represented by legal counsel at their expense, or they may act as their own counsel and conduct their own hearings.
(r)
A certified court reporter may, if desired, be employed by either party at interest, at their expense.
(s)
The protestor shall make the initial presentation in an effort to prove that the award was taken for personal, religious, racial, or political reasons or that the decision was based upon factual error. After the presentation of all evidence, the procurement board may hear closing arguments and shall then take the case under advisement and render a decision at the earliest practicable date.
(t)
The procurement board and mayor and council may reverse the award only on a finding that it was based on error or fact or was motivated by personal, religious, racial, or political reasons. Otherwise it shall affirm the decision.
(u)
The procurement board, after reaching a decision in the case, shall cause an order to be prepared, setting forth their decision and directing appropriate remedies, if any, to resolve the appeal. Except as provided below, the decision of the procurement board in such cases shall be final and conclusive, in the absence of an appellant review. Copies of the board order shall be made a matter of official record and shall be furnished to all parties at interest.
(Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-4))
Sec. 2-185. - Competition.
(a)
All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive to competition include but are not limited to:
(1)
Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business.
(2)
Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding.
(3)
Specifying only a brand name product instead of allowing an equal product to be offered.
(b)
All bid or request for proposal documents will incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use.
(Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-5))
Sec. 2-186. - Methods of procurement.
(a)
Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at $1,000.00. If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
(b)
Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising) are bids publicly solicited and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction. In order for sealed bidding to be used, the following conditions should be present:
(1)
A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;
(2)
Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business;
(3)
The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price; and
(4)
If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
a.
The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
b.
The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;
c.
All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids;
d.
A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
e.
Any or all bids may be rejected whether such right is reserved in public notice or not and in such case the city may readvertise or abandon the project.
(c)
Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:
(1)
Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical; and
(2)
