Each case will be carefully evaluated with respect to its effect on the wastewater treatment system and the environment prior to issuance of a temporary permit and compliance schedule.
(b)
Dilution to decrease concentration of toxic material. Any dilution of the wastewater by the user for the purpose of decreasing the concentrations of toxic materials shall be considered a violation of this division.
(c)
Discharge of septic tanks in sewer system.
(1)
Restricted. It shall be unlawful to empty, dump, throw or otherwise discharge into any manhole, catch basin or other opening, into the city sewer system, or any system connected with and discharging into the sewer system, the contents of any septic tank, sludge, sewage, or other similar matter or material, except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Permits. The superintendent is hereby authorized to grant permits to discharge the contents of septic tanks at locations specified by the superintendent and under his supervision. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the superintendent, continued dumping of such matter into the sewers will be injurious to the sewer system or treatment processes.
(3)
Charges. A charge shall be made for the privilege of dumping the contents of septic tanks, as provided in separate rules. A record shall be kept of such dumpings and statements rendered at the first of each month; the amount of such statements shall be payable within ten days after rendition. Failure to pay the amounts due within such ten-day period shall be cause for revoking the permit.

Sec. 30-209. - Responsibilities of the person discharging waste.
It shall be the responsibility of the person discharging industrial waste into the city sewerage system to:
(1)
Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
(2)
Contact the superintendent prior to operation changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling.
(3)
Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed in the city user charge system.
