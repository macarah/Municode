  (1)
Preparing specifications. It is the responsibility of the department to determine and write bid specifications. The purchasing department may assist in developing specifications. If the purchasing department is involved in developing specifications, the needs of the end user should be the primary focus. After written specifications are complete, the purchasing department will insert into the solicitation document. It is the responsibility of the purchasing department to determine the method of purchase, to ensure that specifications are not so restrictive that only one bid can be obtained and that adequate competition is available. The delivery location must be specified in the original request.
(2)
Brand name specifications. When references are made in solicitation documents to trade names or the brand names of manufacturers, such references are made solely to designate and identify the quality of materials or equipment to be furnished and are not intended to restrict competitive bidding. If comparable materials or equipment with different trade names are offered, then the bidder must establish equivalency. Product literature or catalogs may be submitted to support claim of equality. Several vendors may be able to provide the same manufacturer therefore competition is available. If a department has been approved to standardize equipment, a brand name may be requested with no exceptions unless the source of funds is provided by federal and/or state grants.
(3)
Standardization. Standardization is a method to achieve savings by purchasing a limited number of brands or products. Departments such as fleet or public safety may use this option more frequently than others as a means to guarantee compatibility or proper maintenance and training. The use of the standardization clause is neither automatic nor frequent. The department must submit, in writing, why the standardization clause (brand names) should be used for each occurrence. This documentation will be provided with the formal request and kept for audit purposes. The county manager and or purchasing department have discretion when to use standardization.
(4)
Sole source. Sole source procurements should be infrequently used in purchasing. There are times when a sole source is needed aside from standardization: non-competing districts of a company where Georgia is its own market, proprietary information, software and equipment, continuation of services, or the like. It is the responsibility of the requesting department to articulate the reasoning behind the sole source request. The purchasing department and/or county manager may approve sole source procurement when a clear and compelling reason justifies the sole source.
(5)
Professional services are infrequent and sometimes unique and may not be able to be formally solicited. Formal bids are not required but the governing authority must approve the contract and award if over the threshold. It is the responsibility of the department to articulate why a bid is not in the best interest of the county. In the event professional services are needed but a bid is not requested, the discretion lies with the purchasing manager and county manager.
The department director is responsible for acquiring a detailed scope of services and price which shall not be amended without prior written approval from the dollar amount threshold approving authority. Proof of insurance and a completed e-verify form must be submitted with the detailed scope of services.
The purchasing manager is to submit a professional services exemption letter to the county manager if costs are budgeted and to the board of commissioners if costs are not budgeted or over $0.01 over budget. A purchase order shall be issued after approval has been granted.

This process typically takes up to two to three weeks to solicit, approve, award, and execute contracts.
(11)
Cooperative agreements. The use of state or other verified contracts may be used when approved by the county manager or board of commissioners based on amount to be spent. A cooperative agreement must be in place in order to participate or "piggy-back" off of another contract solicited by another agency.

For federal contracts visit www.gsa.gov for a listing in the event of a federally declared disaster, technology as well as public safety equipment.
b.
The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for a good or service.
c.
These contracts are available to Dawson County for use but are not mandatory. Competitive bidding by Dawson County will not be required if these contracts are utilized. When cooperative agreements are used for source justification, there will be no requirement for board of commissioner approval, unless the dollar amount is meets the threshold for board approval. See Chart 1. If the threshold meets the need for board approval, a procurement approval request letter shall be addressed to the board chairman. The letter shall contain justification for use of the cooperative agreement, the item/services to procure and the dollar amount of purchase.

Financial resources. Has, or can obtain, sufficient financial resources to perform the contract, as required by 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(j)(2)(D).
6.
Production capability. Has, or can obtain, the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities.
7.
Timeliness. Is able to comply with the required delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments.
8.
Performance record. Is able to provide a:
i.
Current performance. Satisfactory current performance record; and
ii.
Past performance. Satisfactory past performance record in view of its records of long-time performance or performance with a predecessor entity, including:
(a)
Sufficient resources. Key personnel with adequate experience, a parent firm with adequate resources and experience, and key subcontractors with adequate experience and past performance,
(b)
Adequate past experience. Past experience in carrying out similar work with particular attention to management approach, staffing, timeliness, technical success, budgetary controls, and other specialized considerations as described in the recipient's solicitation, and
(c)
Any past deficiencies not the fault of the bidder or offeror. A prospective bidder or offeror that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance is presumed to be non-responsible, unless the recipient determines that the circumstances were properly beyond the bidder or offeror's control, or unless the bidder or offeror has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity, perseverance, and effort to perform acceptably is strong evidence of non-responsibility. Failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining satisfactory performance. GDOT expects Dawson County to consider the number of the bidder or offeror's contracts involved and the extent of deficient performance in each contract when making this determination.
f.
Independent cost estimate. A written independent cost estimate, for every procurement with FTA funds, prior to receiving price quotes, bids or proposals needs to be created.
g.
Cost or price analysis. The department head receiving the grant shall work with the purchasing manager to perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action above the federal small acquisition threshold, including contract modifications.
1.
Price analysis. If the county determines that competition was adequate, a written price analysis, rather than a cost analysis, is required to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
2.
Cost analysis. The county must perform or obtain a cost analysis when:
i.
A price analysis will not provide sufficient information to determine the reasonableness of the contract cost.
ii.
When the offeror submits elements of the estimated cost.
iii.
When only a sole source is available, even if the procurement is a contract modification.
iv.
In the event of a change order.
(13)
$25,000.00 and above, sealed solicitations.
a.
The release of sealed solicitations is a formal process to solicit responses from qualified vendors. Federal, state and local laws may and usually will apply based on project. There are three types of sealed solicitations: Invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposals (RFP) and request for qualifications (RFQ).
b.
Departments should assist purchasing with the background information and defining the scope of work or deliverables for the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the department director(s) to provide the budgeting code and ensure funds are loaded for the project. If the project is not pre-funded, purchasing shall receive the account information the department director intends to utilize prior to release of the sealed bid.
The goal of procurement practices is to provide an atmosphere in which all procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition. The county will avoid the following situations considered to be restrictive of competition:
1.
Unreasonable requirements placed on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;
2.
Unnecessary experience and excessive bonding requirements;
3.
Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;
4.
Noncompetitive awards to any person or firm on retainer contracts;
5.
Organizational conflicts of interest, which means that because of other activities, relationships, or contracts, a contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance or advice to the grantee; a contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired; or a contractor has an unfair competitive advantage;
6.
The specification of only a "brand name" product without listing its salient characteristics and not allowing "an equal" product to be offered; and
7.
Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
c.
If the solicitation is of a complex nature, a pre-proposal meeting should be scheduled and detailed in the solicitation document. The meeting can be optional or mandatory.
1.
Invitation for bid (IFB). A sealed IFB is sent to prospective bidders when goods or services desired are well-defined and represent a high dollar purchase of $25,000.00 or more. This policy typically takes six to eight weeks.
2.
Request for proposal (RFP). A formal, sealed RFP is sent to prospective bidders when the goods or services desired are high dollar $25,000.00 or more, complex, and not wholly defined. Same pre-solicitation process as noted for an invitation for bid (IFB) but the focus on the solicitation grading differs. Whereas price is the driving factor with IFBs, a criterion is defined in the RFP and an evaluation committee must score each submittal. This policy typically takes six to eight weeks.
3.
Request for qualifications (RFQ). A formal, sealed RFQ is sent to prospective bidders when the goods or services desired are high dollar $25,000.00 or more, complex, and not wholly defined and where the focus of the project is the qualifications of the vendor not the price. A similar scoring criterion shall be defined in the RFQ.
For some projects where federal laws superseded local policies, price may or may not be an allowable scoring criterion, and therefore may not be requested within the proposal. In this case, the vendor is determined based on the scoring criterion and price is then negotiated with the highest scoring vendor. If a price cannot be agreed upon, the county will move on to the next highest scoring vendor. There are some federal laws that state that price may be used to score but should not be the driving factor.
Both the department and purchasing to take note if federal or state laws provide guidance to bid process such as the Brooks Act or Davis/Bacon Wage Act.
If no other law or policy relates to the RFQ and the team wants to consider pricing but only after scoring, it may be in the best interest of the county to request pricing be sealed separately within RFQ submittal. Vendors should be ranked based on qualifications and only the short listed vendors pricing should be opened.
Because of the complex nature of this type of solicitation, this policy typically takes eight to ten weeks.
Pre-qualification. Prospective vendors may be pre-qualified for particular types of goods or services, typically technical and construction services through the solicitation process, specifically a request for qualifications. The solicitation document should clearly read the intent of the document is to pre-qualify vendors. All procurement rules apply to this form of solicitation such as advertisement notices and award.
Upon establishment of a pre-qualified vendors list, requests for proposals or requests for quotations may be submitted to individuals or companies on the list.
d.
Solicitation provision for federal and state funded projects, specifically FTA funded projects.
"Dawson County has moved to adopt the policies contained in the Georgia Procurement Manual Code of Ethics, (I.4.4. These policies shall apply to Dawson County employees involved in procurement. It is a breach of ethical standards for any Dawson County employee to participate directly or indirectly in a procurement when the employee knows:
• The employee or any member of the employee's immediate family has a financial interest pertaining to the procurement;
• A business or organization in which the employee, or any member of the employee's immediate family, has a financial interest pertaining to the procurement; or
• Any other person, business or organization with whom the employee or any member of employee's immediate family is negotiating or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment is involved in the procurement.
In addition, any persons acting as members of an evaluation committee for any procurement shall, for the purposes of the procurement, be bound by conditions of this section. Throughout the bid/proposal evaluation process and subsequent contract negotiations, offerors shall not discuss or seek specific information about this procurement, including but not limited to, the contents of submissions, the evaluation process or the contract negotiations, with members of any evaluation committee, Dawson County employees or other governing board members other than the designated procurement officer."
e.
Confidential information. A County employee may not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, for the purpose of furthering a private interest, confidential information acquired by virtue of their position or employment with county.
f.
Buy America Requirements for FTA construction contracts and acquisition for goods or rolling stock solicitations valued at $150,000.00 or greater must notify bidders of the Buy America regulation as stated in 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) and 49 CFR 661.13 which stipulate that federal funds may not be obligated unless steel, iron and manufactured products used in FTA-funded projects are produced in the United States, unless a waiver has been granted by TFA or the product is subject to general waiver as listed in 49 CFR 661.7. Rolling stock must be assembled in the United States and have a 60 percent domestic content.
A bidder or offeror must submit to the FTA recipient the appropriate Buy America certification with all bids or offers on FTA-funded contracts, except those subject to general waiver. Bid or offers that are not accompanied by a completed Buy America certification must be rejected as nonresponsive. This requirement does not apply to lower tier subcontractors.
(Ord. of 1-17-2019)

(b)
Bonds. Bonds add another layer of protection to the county. If the procurement of goods/services opens the county up to additional liability, bonds should be required. Bonds should always be required in public works construction projects and Georgia Department of Transportation funded projects. The decision to require bonds in a formal solicitation, are at the discretion of the purchasing Manager and the county manager if not required by federal or state law.
(1)

(4)
All bonds would be payable to Dawson County board of commissioners. Failure to submit appropriate bonding will result in automatic rejection of bid. Bonding company must be authorized to do business in Georgia by the Georgia Insurance Commission, listed in the Department of Treasury's publication of companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable surety on federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, and have an A.M. Best rating.
(5)
The cost of bonds may be included in the vendor's price proposal but should not be line item priced. The county will not pay for bonds and are considered cost of doing business.
(6)
Bonds will be released at the discretion of the project manager who ensures the vendor has fulfilled the scope of work, the purchasing manager to ensure all contractual obligations have been satisfied and the final approval is of the county manager. Usually, this is 30 days after successful completion and acceptance of the project.
(c)
Retainage. When a project is of import but not to the level of requiring bonds, the purchasing manager may add language to the solicitation document and contracts regarding retainage. The vendor shall be paid for work performed based upon satisfactory inspections and completion of the agreed upon draw schedule. The vendor's fee will be paid on a Net 30 basis less ten percent retainage.
(1)
Retainage will be released at the discretion of the project manager who ensures the vendor has fulfilled the scope of work, the purchasing manager to ensure all contractual obligations have been satisfied and the final approval is of the county manager. Usually, this is 30 days after successful completion and acceptance of the project.
(d)
Pre-bid and pre-proposal conferences. The nature of some solicitations require that a pre-bid or pre-proposal conference be held in order to clarify specifications, answer bidder questions regarding specific requirements, or to allow bidders to perform a site visit, review and/or inspection.
(1)
The purchasing department and requesting department will confer whether to hold a pre- bid/proposal conference. Conferences are not the standard. If the project is over $100,000.00 or bonds are in effect, a meeting is required and mandatory. Information regarding conferences will be included in all legal notice(s). If it is later determined a meeting is necessary, an addenda must be issued and bidders must have enough notice to make arrangements to attend.
(2)
All attendees are to sign in on the sheet provided by purchasing. In the event a meeting is mandatory, bidders not signed in may not submit a response. The sign in will be posted on the county's website.
(e)
Addenda. Any changes to the original solicitation will be made in writing in the form of an addendum, and will be placed on the County's website. All addenda shall be issued prior to 72 hours of the bid opening date for public works, roads and bridges projects and when expending federal and state funds. If such an addendum is deemed necessary after this period, the bid opening date must be extended 72 hours form the original set date, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. It is the responsibility of the bidder to obtain any and all addenda and submit with their response.
In addition, if bidders have any additional questions or information requests regarding a specific procurement, they are to be emailed or faxed directly to purchasing as directed in the solicitation document. Responses to pertinent questions will be answered in the form of addenda.
(f)
Bid opening. All bids shall be opened at a time and place designated in the solicitation request. The purchasing manager and/or CFO and one other staff member, not from the requesting department, acting as a witness shall open all sealed bids. Late bids will not be accepted. Late bids will be rejected and returned. This cannot be waived by any entity. Sealed responses are required. Vendors who fail to return sealed responses will be rejected and returned. If at least three bids are not received the board of commissioners may reject, requiring a re-bid. Witnesses should not be from the department requesting the bids.
(1)
In the case of invitation for bids, the names and prices shall be read aloud. Dawson County does not report an "apparent low bid." For request for proposals or qualifications, only the names shall be read aloud due to the need for future evaluation and review of the proposals.
(2)
Bids/proposals are not subject to the Georgia Open Records Act until such time that as the final award of the contract is made, the project is terminated or abandoned, or the board takes a vote regarding the solicitation, whichever comes first as per O.C.G.A. § 50-18-72(a)(10). Some materials may be redacted per the Georgia Open Records Act and the records custodian and/or the county attorney can assist in determining what, if any information may be redacted.
(g)
Modifications/corrections of bids. If an error is discovered prior to the submittal deadline, the bidder may submit the corrected information in a sealed envelope clearly marked on the outside of the container. The outside must contain the company name, the bid number and the following sentence: "Replace previously sent response". The first submission cannot be considered valid.
If an obvious clerical error is discovered after the bid opening, the bidder may submit a letter to purchasing requesting that the error be corrected. This request needs to be made within 24 hours of error being found. Final determination as to whether to accept the correction is up to purchasing. Generally, modifications made to open bids are not accepted for any reason other than the aforementioned. The error is subject to the limitations described below and may be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the vendor. A nonmaterial omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing manager determines the correction to be in the county's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
(1)
Unit price information; and
(2)
Total price information when unit prices are not required.
(h)
Withdrawal of bids. A bid submission may be withdrawn without forfeiture of the bid security as per O.C.G.A. § 13-10-22, if applicable, if such error in the calculation can be documented by clear and convincing written evidence; such error can be shown from inspection of original work papers, etc. of the bidder; the bid was submitted in good faith and mistake was due to a calculation or clerical error, an inadvertent omission or a typographical error as opposed to an error in judgement. This request must be made within 48 hours, not including Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays, of bid opening and prior to award.
If a bid withdrawal occurs, the remaining bids are to be treated as if the withdrawn bid was not submitted. No bidder permitted to withdraw a bid shall perform any subcontract or other work for the person or firm to whom the contract is awarded or otherwise benefit directly or indirectly for affiliated project.
(i)
Evaluating submittals.
(1)
An evaluation committee will be named during the pre-solicitation meetings between the requesting department and purchasing. This group shall consist of county personnel who have knowledge of the goods/services to be procured, will be affected by the solicitation or have other applicable knowledge. The committee shall score and rank proposals based on information solely provided within the vendor's submittal against the rubric in the solicitation document. Scoring criteria will be set by the purchasing department and the requesting department. It is the responsibility of each evaluator to:
a.
Read the solicitation document in its entirety.
b.
Read each submittal in its entirety.
c.
Confirm responsiveness to the request: Ensure vendor has provided all information required in the RFP. Use the scoring criteria, scope of work and the vendor's checklist for assistance.
d.
Check references thoroughly. Evaluators are encouraged to work together or share information received during this step only, i.e. email references or other correspondence from references. Never discuss scores with other evaluators until advised by purchasing to do so. Points should never be given if references are not vetted. All other sections of the evaluation are to be completed by each evaluator individually.
e.
Evaluators should score using their own knowledge.
f.
Contact purchasing with any questions that need clarification or additional information. Direct contact with vendors, each other or any other individual while in the solicitation process is strictly forbidden.
g.
Complete the evaluation score sheet and return to purchasing along with original submittal packets.
h.
Attend meetings when scheduled of the evaluation committee to include, meetings, interviews, demonstrations, etc.
(2)

(3)
Proposer interview/presentation meeting.
a.
After the evaluation committee has completed its process and the purchasing manager has received all evaluation forms, the consensus of the committee may be to hold proposer interviews/presentations. The proposers must be invited in order of ranking. Example: The first and third ranked submissions cannot be invited to this meeting but, exclude the second ranked submission.
b.
Purchasing's responsibility is to invite bidders, create agenda, lead discussions, take minutes, and facilitate entire process. The requesting department should assist in formulating questions prior to the formal meeting. The evaluation committee is to prepare new evaluation forms and submit to the purchasing department. This score will supersede the previous score for those proposers that participated in this phase of the evaluation.
(j)

Dawson County reserves the right to cancel solicitations at any time.
Dawson County shall be the sole judge of the provider's ability to meet the requirements set forth. Their decision in determining responsible and responsive provider(s) will be final. Dawson County reserves the right to act in its best interest in this determinations process, to waive all technicalities, and to select the most responsible and responsive treatment provider.
(l)
Disqualification of bids.
(1)
Bids may be disqualified or deemed non-responsive by purchasing as a result of, but not necessarily limited to, the following reasons:
a.
Failure to return all required documents with signature where applicable.
b.
Failure to follow the bid schedule to include excluding mandatory pre-bid attendance submittal deadline.
c.
Failure to return applicable compliance/specification sheets.
d.
Failure to acknowledge receipt of applicable addenda.
e.
Failure of bidder to sign all required documents excluding the vendor's price proposal form.
f.
Failure of the bidder to extend pricing beyond the required 90 days.
g.
Failure to meet specified delivery requirements.
h.
Prices of services or items exceed the departments budgeted amount allowed for these items.
(2)
Bids shall be disqualified or deemed non-responsive by purchasing as a result of, but not necessarily limited to, the following reasons:
a.
Failure to follow solicitation schedule for mandatory pre-bid attendance and response submittal.
b.
Failure to provide bid bond, where required.
c.
Failure to hold firm pricing.
d.
Failure to sign and submit the vendor's price proposal form. The bidder/proposer may submit other pages to complete their price proposal along with this form.
(m)
Vendor responsibility. It is the responsibility of each vendor to read and understand all requirements in the solicitation documents. If an item is unclear, the vendor should submit questions to the purchasing department. Vendors shall submit all required documentation, fully executed, as directed in the solicitation document. Additionally, vendors should be familiar with all federal, state and local rules, regulations, policies and procedures pertaining to each solicitation. Furthermore, vendors performing work in Dawson County are required to register with the Dawson County planning and development department. Out of County bidders are not required to register as part of a bid submittal. Only the successful, awarded vendor is required to register their business license.
(n)
Negotiations. If the department has selected a vendor but pricing or deliverables need to be negotiated, an invitation will be sent via email to the vendor. Enough notice shall be given to ensure the vendor can make reasonable accommodations to participate.
(1)
Generally there should be only three rounds of negotiations with the selected vendor.
(2)
If a price is not agreed upon, the best and final offer phase should be opened to all proposers deemed responsive and responsible.
(o)
Best and final offers. Best and final offers, or BAFO, are formal requests being made for more information, confirmation, revisions, and/or to obtain better pricing or value. BAFO are not mandatory and should be used rarely. This method allows bidders to amend their proposal. Value engineering is not considered a reasonable cause to enter into best and final offers. All bidders whose proposals are deemed reasonable susceptible for further consideration or award should be invited to BAFO discussions. Any rejected bidders are not invited. The purchasing department will email an invitation for best and final offer negotiations to the responsive, responsible bidder(s) deemed susceptible for award based on the criteria set forth in the solicitation document.
(p)
Purchasing's responsibility is to invite bidders, create agenda, lead discussions, take minutes, and facilitate entire process. The requesting department should assist in formulating questions prior to the formal meeting. At no time should competing bids/proposals, technical or cost, be discussed with bidders. Do not discuss where bidders are in the standing. Teleconferences are allowed if the evaluation committee feels this method fosters open dialogue and all questions can be addressed. There are times in-person discussions will be requested.
(q)
The county will identify which offerors shall participate in the negotiations in one of the following ways:
(1)
Identify in the solicitation document the methodology that will be used to identify offerors to participate in negotiations. This may include, but is not necessarily limited to, a methodology that establishes a competitive range based on offerors" rankings following proposal evaluations.
(2)
Identify in an addendum to the solicitation document the methodology that will be used to identify offerors to participate in negotiations.
(3)
Negotiate with all responsive responsible offerors following bid/proposal evaluations.
(r)
After the negotiations, participating offerors may be asked to submit supplemental proposals defining the revisions that are a result of negotiations. Any request for supplemental proposals will be directed in writing to all offerors participating in the negotiations, and will provide details concerning the format and due date for the supplemental proposals. The county may in its sole discretion terminate negotiations and/or the solicitation at any time.
(s)
The offeror that ultimately wins a contract may not be the lowest cost offeror because the higher quality of the winning bidder's technical proposal may offset an increased cost or because no agreement could be reached as to contract terms and conditions. The final decision and all documentation is considered open records upon award.
(t)
Award.
(1)
Timeline. The appropriate body or office must make the decision regarding a sealed solicitation within 60 days of the bid opening if bonds are in effect and 90 days of the bid opening if bonds are not required. In the unlikely event the county needs additional time to evaluate responses; the purchasing manager will contact each vendor and request additional time. If approval is garnered by each vendor then the solicitation award may be delayed to a time specific. If approval is not given by all vendors, purchasing will submit an agenda packet to the county manager asking for the rejection of the bid submittals and a re-bid shall be released. Only the board of commissioners can decide regarding sealed solicitations if the purchase is not budgeted, $0.01 over budget, if a highway, bridge, ferry or public works solicitation no matter the anticipated costs or if the lowest bidder or highest scored proposer is not recommended. Solicitations should never be allowed to expire without a formal decision. It is the responsibility of the purchasing manager to notify the chief financial officer and county manager of any issues or delays in the process ahead of time.
The board of commissioners may choose to award highways, bridges, ferries or public works projects with a not-to-exceed amount to streamline change orders.
(2)
Award to the lowest bidder. In the case of invitation for bids, for goods or services, if all proposals are not rejected the awarded shall be to the lowest, most responsive, responsible bidder unless legal justification can be articulated to the purchasing manager and the county manager.
(3)
Award to the highest rated proposal. In the case of request for proposals or request for qualifications, for goods or services, if all proposals are not rejected, the award may be to the highest rated proposal, taking into account the selection criteria. Construction or improvement of real property or buildings fall under public works/construction rules, and must comply with numerous special requirements as specified in federal and state laws not listed in this policy.
(4)
Award to a single vendor. If all bids are not rejected, the award shall be to the most responsible, responsive bidder. However, in determining which is the most responsible bidder, the county may take into consideration the bidders responsiveness to the county's requirements, the price and/or quality of any of the articles to be purchased or leased, availability of parts and service, delivery time, and those factors listed in the solicitation document. If no criterion is listed, as in the case of IFBs, award will usually go to the lowest, responsive, responsible bidder.
(5)
Award to multiple bidders. The county may award to multiple bidders for the same commodity or service when the bid specifications provide for special circumstances. Special circumstances may include differences in ability to deliver, delivery time, availability of material, special loading or unloading conditions, total cost including transport or labor if not included with bid item, performance of the delivered material, location of the source, and proximity to the delivery point. The intention to do so must be indicated within the solicitation document.
(6)
Tie. In the event of a tie and all pricing and qualifications are equal, the vendors are contacted and notified of the status. The vendors are invited to Dawson County to watch the county manager flip a coin to determine who wins. The second option is to open a new deck of cards and allow each to shuffle and then the county manager deals one card to each vendor. The highest card wins the award.
(7)
As per O.C.G.A. § 36-10-1, all public works contracts entered into by the county governing authority with other persons on behalf of the county shall be in writing and entered on its minutes. The board of commissioners is the county governing authority.
As per O.C.G.A. § 32-4-61, all highway, bridges and ferries contract for work on all or part of the county road system shall be in writing and shall be approved by resolution shall be entered on the minutes of such county.
(u)
Presentation of recommendation. Once a consensus has been met and a recommendation has been made, the purchasing manager will begin the board of commissioners agenda packet which consists of the agenda request form, a PowerPoint presentation, contract and pricing as applicable. The presenter will be the department head, the subject matter expert. If the commodity crosses several departments it may be best for purchasing to present. A representative from the requesting department should attend all presentations in order to answer subject matter questions from the board. The purchasing manager shall present in the absence of the subject matter expert. The CFO shall present in the absence of both the subject matter expert and the purchasing manager.
(v)
Purchase orders.
(1)
A requesting department may request a purchase order for goods or services if in budget. A quote analysis form must be completed and returned with quotes between $3,000.00 and $24,999.99. No purchase order will be issued for any item/service not budgeted, $0.01 over budget or a highways, bridges ferries or public works project without first being approved by the board of commissioners, unless the procurement is for items listed under section 2-114 or section 2-111(11). Requests should not be submitted if budget is not approved or available. All account information must be provided at the time of submittal. Purchase requisitions shall be submitted to purchasing at least one week prior to the proposed purchase. A purchase order is considered a binding contract.
(2)

The process does not require that the items, or the provider, be the same; but rather that the items be "like items," and the vendors be from the same general vendor/provider group.

(Ord. of 1-17-2019)
Sec. 2-121. - Local small business initiative.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
(1)
Giving preference to local suppliers, even if it means spending a little more, can actually benefit a county's finances. Dollars spent locally generate additional economic activity even beyond the value of the initial contract as the local supplier in turn sources goods and services locally. Each additional dollar that circulates locally boosts economic activity, employment, and ultimately tax revenue. A study in Arizona found that using local independent suppliers for state contracts results in three times the economic benefit of bids fulfilled through national chains.
(2)
Local small business initiative (LSBI) is a Dawson County program designed to promote opportunities to local small businesses located in Dawson County.
(3)
The LSBI program is designed to return as much taxpayer money to the local economy, in a relatively short time span, as possible while at the same time foster inclusiveness with the county's procurement activities and a goal to provide more opportunities for Dawson County businesses.
(b)
Definition of local small business.
(1)
Local small business shall mean a business which has its principal office located in and having a street address within Dawson County for at least six months immediately prior to the issuance of the quote/bid/proposal.

(2)
Must hold a valid business license required by the county and have no outstanding or unresolved fees, fines or penalties due to Dawson County.
(3)
Not have more than 25 employees, and of which at least 33 percent of those employees have their primary residence in Dawson County, or, if the business has no employees, the business shall be at least 51 percent owned by one or more persons whose primary residence in Dawson County.
(4)
Have a banking relationship with a bank located in Dawson County.
(5)
Average annual gross receipts of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) or less over the previous three years.
(6)
Must certify under oath to the above criteria upon submission for any bid, solicitation, or proposal to Dawson County.
(c)
The LSBI policy will not be applicable for the following types of purchases, bids, or solicitations.
(1)
Goods or services provided under a cooperative purchasing agreement or inter-local agreement;
(2)
Purchases or contracts which are funded in whole or part by a governmental entity and the laws, regulations, or policies governing such funding prohibit application of preference;
(3)
Purchases made or contracts let under emergency or non-competitive situations or for legal services;
(4)
Projects over $100,000.00.
(d)
Affidavit. The county will accept an affidavit that a business meets the county's standards to be considered a local small business. The county, in its sole discretion, may request additional information from the business to support its claim of being a local small business. The purchasing department will be required to review the affidavit and request additional information as necessary to ensure the LSBI criteria are satisfied. The county will notify a business of acceptance of LSBI certification.
(e)
How incentive works. Under any applicable solicitation or bid, vendors desiring to receive local preference under the LSBI policy will be required to affirmatively demonstrate via affidavit that they satisfy all pertinent requirements. Any vendor who fails to submit the required affidavit shall be automatically excluded from LSBI consideration. Vendors shall submit the affidavit with each solicitation or bid proposal. The affidavit contemplated under this policy is valid only for the submitted solicitation or bid, and must be reaffirmed and resubmitted for each subsequent solicitation of bid.
For any solicitation that is under $100,000.00 the local small business (as demonstrated via affidavit) that submits a responsive, responsible price, a local preference credit of three percent.
(f)
Waiver. The application of local preference to a particular purchase, contract, bid, solicitation or category of contracts may be waived by the Dawson County board of county commissioners in its sole discretion. The promulgation of this policy is not intended nor should it be construed as created a right or property interest in local preference or in the local preference credit.
