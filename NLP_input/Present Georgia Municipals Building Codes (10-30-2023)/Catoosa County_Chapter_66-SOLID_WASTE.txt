ARTICLE III. - LITTER CONTROL[2]

Sec. 66-76. - Findings; authority.
The Catoosa County Board of Commissioners finds that litter found throughout Catoosa County often finds its way into the county's streams, rivers and lakes and detracts from the quality of life for the citizens of Catoosa County. Pollutants carried into the county's streams, rivers, and lakes by litter diminish the quality of the county's water and its aquatic resources. The Catoosa County Board of Commissioners deems it necessary to adopt this litter control ordinance in order to provide a prohibition against littering and to provide an enforcement mechanism with penalties for dealing with those found littering.
This article is modeled on the "Georgia Litter Control Law" (O.C.G.A. § 16-7-40 et. seq.) and the adoption of this article is authorized by the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 16-7-48.
(Ord. No. 06-007, § 1, 5-25-06)
Sec. 66-77. - General provisions.
(1)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of the citizens of Catoosa County, through the regulation and prevention of litter. The objectives of this article are to:
(a)
Provide for uniform prohibition throughout the unincorporated areas of Catoosa County of any and all littering on public or private property; and
(b)
Prevent the desecration of the beauty and quality of life of the citizens of Catoosa County and to prevent harm to the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of said citizens, including the degradation of water and aquatic resources caused by litter.
(2)
Applicability. This article shall apply to all public and private property located within the unincorporated areas of Catoosa County, Georgia.
(3)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article impose restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(4)
Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.
(Ord. No. 06-007, § 2, 5-25-06)
