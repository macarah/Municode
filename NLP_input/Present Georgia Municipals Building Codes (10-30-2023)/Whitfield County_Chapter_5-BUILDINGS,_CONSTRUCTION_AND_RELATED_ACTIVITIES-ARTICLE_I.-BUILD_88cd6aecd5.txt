Existing building certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy for any existing building may be obtained by applying to the building inspector and supplying the information and data necessary to determine compliance with the technical codes for the occupancy intended. Where necessary, in the opinion of the building inspector, two sets of detailed drawings, or a general inspection, or both, may be required. When, upon examination and inspection, it is found that the building conforms to the provisions of the technical codes and other applicable laws and ordinances for such occupancy, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued.
(b)
Certificate of completion. Upon satisfactory completion of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected to a utility system. The certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building such as a shell building prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(c)
Service utilities.
1.
Connection of service utilities. No person shall make connections from a utility source of energy, fuel or power to any building or system which is regulated by the technical codes for which a permit is required, until released by the building inspector and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued.
2.
Temporary connection. The building inspector may authorize the temporary connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy.
3.
Authority to disconnect service utilities. The building inspector shall have the power to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building structure or system regulated by the technical codes, in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building inspector shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building structure or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building structure or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter.
(d)
Posting floor loads.
1.
Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose which will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The building inspector may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded.
2.
Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor or occupant of group S and group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot is uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building inspector.
3.
Signs required. In every building or part of a building used for storage, industrial or hazardous purposes, the safe floor loads, as reviewed by the building inspector on the plan, shall be marked on plates or approved design which shall be supplied and securely affixed by the owner of the building in a conspicuous place in each story to which they relate. Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

(b)
Variances. The construction board of adjustment and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this Code to a particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this Code or the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
1.
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others.
2.
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action inaction of the applicant.
3.
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other buildings, structures or service system.
4.
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system.
5.
The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Code and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. In granting the variance, the construction board of adjustment and appeals may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the construction board of adjustment and appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this Code.

(d)
Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure, or service system which, in the opinion of the building inspector, in unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building inspector may, in his order, limit the time for such notice of appeals to a shorter period.
