The term "emergency 9-1-1 system" also includes enhanced 9-1-1 service, which means an emergency telephone system that provides the caller with emergency 9-1-1 system service and, in addition, directs 9-1-1 calls to appropriate public safety answering points by selective routing based on the geographical location from which the call originated and provides the capability for automatic number identification and automatic location identification features.
Exchange access facility means the access from a particular telephone subscriber's premises to the telephone system of a service supplier. Exchange access facilities include service supplier provided access lines, PBX trunks and Centrex network access registers, all as defined by tariffs of the telephone companies as approved by the state public service commission. Exchange access facilities do not include service supplier owned and operated telephone pay station lines, wide area telecommunications services (WATS), foreign exchange (FX) or incoming-only lines.
9-1-1 charge means a contribution to the local government for the 9-1-1 service start-up equipment costs; subscriber notification costs; addressing costs; billing costs; nonrecurring and recurring installation, maintenance, service and network charges of a service supplier providing 9-1-1 service pursuant to this article; and costs associated with the hiring, training and compensating of dispatchers employed by the county to operate the 9-1-1 system at the public safety answering points.
