Sec. 40-39. - Rotating operator list.
(a)
The licensing officer shall compile a listing of towing and recovery service operators licensed under this article that are qualified to accept calls for the purposes of hauling or storing vehicles as those terms are defined herein. Towing and recovery service operators shall be contacted for calls on a rotating basis in the order that they appear on said list; that is, the operator shall be selected which next succeeds the last operator called for towing and recovery services. Selections shall proceed in a like manner until the end of the list is reached, at which point, a towing and recovery service operator shall be selected from the top of the list, and so on, consecutively. The order of towing and recovery service operators on each list shall be as shown on the list maintained by the county 911 center as it exists as of such date or as otherwise directed by the county administrator. Thereafter, each list shall be regularly updated by the licensing officer, with any new licensees being added to the appropriate list in the order in which their application was approved. No towing and recovery service operator may be listed on any one list more than once, and may in no event use alternate legal entities or employ other strategies so as to effectively circumvent said limitation. When a towing and recovery service operator has failed or refused to respond as required herein, or has failed to reach a vehicle within the time prescribed herein, said operator shall be passed over on the applicable rotation list and shall be deemed to have responded for purposes of determining selection on the following call. The county 911 central dispatcher (or other authorized officer) shall call towing and recovery service operators in accordance with the applicable rotating list based on the instructions of the public safety officer or other responsible official at the scene.
(b)
Any wreckers called by the county 911 central dispatcher shall be required to reach the vehicle to be hauled within 45 minutes of said dispatcher's call, and after said 45-minute period said dispatcher shall be authorized to call the next towing and recovery service operator eligible for a call on the list maintained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The refusal or failure of any towing and recovery service operator to immediately answer any call shall be deemed a refusal to answer. The failure or refusal to answer a call, or the failure to reach a vehicle within the time prescribed, three or more times within any six-month period shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license issued hereunder.

Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances justify. Unless the circumstances otherwise justify, the hearing shall be generally held no later than 45 days after the fully completed application is filed with the licensing officer, or after the licensing officer has suspended a license. If a license is denied by the licensing officer under this article, the reasons for such denial shall be set forth in writing to the applicant. The applicant shall have 30 days following receipt of notice of denial to appeal the decision of the licensing officer to the governing authority, which shall review such application de novo at the next regular meeting of the governing authority following receipt of any such appeal, or, at the election of said governing authority, at a special meeting within 45 days following said appeal; provided, however, that any appeal received within ten business days prior to the next regular meeting of the governing authority shall be heard at the second regularly scheduled meeting of said governing authority following receipt of said appeal. If the governing authority affirms the decision of the licensing officer, then the license shall be denied. If the decision of the licensing officer is reversed, then the license shall be issued to the applicant. Alternatively, the governing authority may elect to issue the license subject to such reasonable conditions as the governing authority deems appropriate.
(b)
The licensing officer may suspend a license where there is evidence of due cause under subsection (c) of this section for revoking the license. Such action by the licensing officer shall be reported, in writing, to the governing authority.

(4)
Allowing any condition relating to the towing and recovery services that endangers public health or safety.
(d)
Unless otherwise determined by the board of commissioners following a hearing as provided herein, any licensee may petition for reinstatement of any license revoked hereunder no sooner than six months from the date of revocation. Such petition shall be submitted on forms provided by the county, and shall first be reviewed by the Liberty County 911 Board (or other person or body designated by the county administrator), who, following a hearing in the matter, shall make a recommendation regarding reinstatement to the board of commissioners. Said recommendation shall be nonbinding, and shall be decided by the board of commissioners following a subsequent hearing in matter.
