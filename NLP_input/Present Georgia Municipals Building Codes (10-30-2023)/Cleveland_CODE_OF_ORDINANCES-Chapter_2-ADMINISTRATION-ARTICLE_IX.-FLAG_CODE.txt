National anthem; star-spangled banner. The composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the United States of America.
(b)
Conduct during playing. During the rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed there.

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all," should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform, men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.
(d)

(6)
The flag should be displayed in or near every polling place on election days.
(7)
The flag should be displayed in or near every schoolhouse.
(e)
Position and manner of display. The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag, should be either on the marching right (that is, the flag's own right) or, if there is a line of other flags, in front or the center of that line.
(1)
The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except from a staff, or as provided in subsection (e)(9) of this section.
(2)
The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle or of a railroad train or a boat. When the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right fender.
(3)
No other flag or pennant should be placed above, or if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or international flag equal to, above, or in a position of superior prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the United States at any place within the United States or any territory or possession thereof, provided that nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of practice heretofore followed of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United States at the headquarters of the United Nations.
(4)
The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.
(5)
The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of states or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.
(6)
When flags of state, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States flag's right.
(7)
When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs off the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace.
(8)
When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half-staff. When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the building.
(9)
When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.
(10)
When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east and west street or the east in a north and south street.
(11)
When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.
(12)
The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statute or monument, but it should never be used as the covering of the statute or monument.
(13)
The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day, the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States government and the governor of a state, territory, or possession as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the governor of that state, territory, or possession may proclaim that the national flag shall be flown at half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from the death of the President or former President; ten days from the day of death of the Vice-president, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department, a former Vice-president, or the governor of a state, territory, or possession; and the day of death and the following day for a member of Congress. The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day. The flag will be flown at half-staff for one hour before the memorial service through the conclusion of the memorial service for those county, City of Cleveland and City of Helen employees killed in the line of duty. On those other occasions when an active employee dies, whether at work or not, a wreath will be placed at the base of the flag pole located in front of each governing authority's office. As used in this subsection:
a.
The term "half-staff" means the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff;
b.
The term "executive department" means the Department of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, or Veterans Affairs;
c.
The term "military department" means the Department of the Army, Navy, or Air Force; and
d.
The term "member of Congress" means a Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico.
(14)
When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.
(15)
When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the east.
(f)
Respect for flag. No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, state flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.
(1)
The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.
(2)
The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.
(3)
The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.
(4)
The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.
(5)
The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.
(6)
The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
(7)
The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, not attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
(8)
The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, caring, or delivering anything.
(9)
The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.
(10)
No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firefighters, police officers, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel pin, being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.
(11)
The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.
(g)
Conduct during hoisting, lowering or passing of the flag. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in review, all persons present, except those in uniform, should face the flag and stand at attention with the right hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should render the military salute. When not in uniform, men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Aliens should stand at attention. The salute to the flag in a moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag passes.
(h)
Flag presentation. Presentation of the flag during a ceremony should be preceded by a brief talk emphasizing the importance of the occasion. Following the presentation all present should salute the flag, recite the pledge of allegiance, and sing the national anthem.
(i)
Folding the flag.
(1)
Two persons, facing each other, hold the flag waist high and horizontally between them.
(2)
The lower striped section is folded, lengthwise, over the blue field. Hold bottom to top and edges together securely.

Fold the flag again, lengthwise, folded edge to open edge.
(4)
A triangular fold is started along the length of the flag, from the end to the heading by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open edge.
(5)
The outer point is turned inward parallel with the open edge, forming a second triangle.
(6)
Repeat the triangular folding until the entire length of the flag is folded.
(7)
When the flag is completely folded, only the triangular blue field should be visible.
