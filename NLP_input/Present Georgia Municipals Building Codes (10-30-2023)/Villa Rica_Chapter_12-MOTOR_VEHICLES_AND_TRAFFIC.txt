State Law reference— Local authority desiring to establish operating standards for personal transportation vehicles shall comply with vehicle transportation plan part under Uniform Rules of the Road, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-330; vehicle transportation plan, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-372.

Sec. 12-23. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "Villa Rica Personal Transportation Vehicle Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 02-15-CCO, § 1(11-50), 7-7-2015; Ord. No. 09-15-CCO, § 1(11-50), 9-1-2015)
Sec. 12-24. - Findings and intent.
The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles (PTVs) and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of PTV on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in PTV on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of PTV on roads, sidewalks, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates PTV and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this article as a condition of operating PTV and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city.
(Ord. No. 02-15-CCO, § 1(11-51), 7-7-2015; Ord. No. 09-15-CCO, § 1(11-51), 9-1-2015)
Sec. 12-25. - Definitions.
The definitions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1 are adopted and incorporated by reference herein. In addition, the following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Designated right-of-way or other public property means all public rights-of-way and public property of the city except public property excluded by this article, by this section, or by state law.
Proof of insurance means written proof of liability insurance on the PTV insuring against personal injury and damage to property of any nature relative to the operation of PTV on designated city streets in an amount not less than required by state law for motor vehicles operated on public roads in the state. Homeowners insurance typically covers PTV as personal property unless the homeowner resides in a golf cart community.
Registration decal means a decal that bears a sequence of numbers, letters, or both and is issued by the city to identify an officially registered PTV.
Valid motor vehicle driver's license means any current and valid certificate issued by the state, other state of the United States of America, or international agency which permits persons to operate motor vehicles on the public roads of the state.
