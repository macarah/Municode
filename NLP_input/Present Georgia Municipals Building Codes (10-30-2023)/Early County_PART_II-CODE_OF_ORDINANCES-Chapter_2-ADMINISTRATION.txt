Sec. 2-189. - Role; duties; functions; qualifications.
(a)
The role and responsibility of the county attorney has evolved, through legislative changes and professional and ethical considerations as to the proper role in representing the county, its governing authority and its constitutional officers.
(b)
The primary function of the county attorney is to provide legal advice to and to represent the county. In doing so, the county attorney's duties include advising and representing the governing authority, sheriff, tax commissioner, clerk of superior court, probate court judge, officials and employees of the county. The county attorney's duties also include advising the governing authority and other county officers and employees on their powers and duties under the law, to prepare ordinances and legal documents, to review proposed contracts, and to represent the county and its officers in legal proceedings.

(d)
The county is committed to ensuring that each and every county official receives proper and adequate legal representation, when appropriate, from the county attorney for actions taken pursuant to his public duties.
(e)
Due to the relationship of the county governing authority and constitutional officers and employees of the county, there may arise a legal conflict of interest which would necessitate independent legal representation of the constitutional officer or employee.
(f)
It is the county's position that in cases where there is a legal conflict of interest with the county attorney providing legal representation or where the simultaneous or dual representation by the county attorney of any officer or employee of the county and the governing authority would constitute a legal conflict of interest, the county should provide for independent legal representation of the county officer or employee.
(g)
The county attorney, as a professional and a member of the state bar, is sworn to uphold the requirements of professionalism. As such, the county attorney should seek to fully inform the governing authority and any affected county officer of all decisions affecting the resolution of any dispute requiring representation.
(h)
The county attorney should clearly communicate with the governing authority and any affected county officers concerning the nature of the representation.
(i)
The county attorney should communicate with the governing authority and any affected county officers particularly regarding settlements and discussions of proposed terms of settlements.
(j)
The county attorney should counsel the governing authority and affected county officers and employees on the value of cooperation as a means towards the productive resolution of disputes.
