On properties in any areas being used for Business use.
(4)
On properties in any areas being used for Agricultural use.
(5)
On properties in any areas being used for Residential use.
(B)
If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of any higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the Applicant if the permit were not granted for the Wireless Facility as proposed.
(C)
An Applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An Application shall address co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the County why co-location is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
(D)
Notwithstanding the above, the Clay County Board of Commissioners may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the Board of Commissioners finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the County and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the Board of Commissioners may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this Ordinance and the public interest as determined by the Board of Commissioners.
(E)
If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the Application, including the technical justification for such.
(F)
Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the Clay County Board of Commissioners may disapprove an Application for any of the following reasons:
(1)
Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2)
Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district;
(3)
The use or construction of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific land use designation;
(4)
The placement and location of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the County, or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
(5)
The placement and location of a Wireless Telecommunications Facility would result in a conflict with, compromise in or change of the nature or character of the surrounding area;
(6)
Conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance;
(7)
Failure to submit a complete Application as required under this Ordinance.
(G)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, for good cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a shorter or less intrusive facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the Clay County Board of Commissioners may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the site chosen by the Applicant may require the use of more than one site to provide substantially the same service if the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in combination, so long as such does not prohibit or serve to prohibit the provision of service.

Sec. 155.11. - Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities and other structures.
(A)
Clay County, as opposed to the construction of a new Tower, requires Wireless Facilities to be located on existing Towers or other suitable structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure, unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable. The Applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing Towers and other suitable structures within one mile of the location of any proposed new Tower, unless the Applicant can show that some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing Tower or other suitable structure cannot be used.
(B)
An Applicant intending to locate on an existing Tower or other suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the Applicant.
(C)
Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum Antenna array technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within Clay County, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.

Sec. 155.12. - Height of telecommunications tower(s).
(A)
All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.
(B)
The Applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any Tower, Facility and/or Antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within Clay County, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
(C)
The maximum permitted total height of a new Tower shall be 120 above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 120-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
(D)
Notwithstanding the 120-foot maximum permitted height, Telecommunications Towers and Facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within Clay County, and only within Clay County.

(C)
Dual Mode: In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, Clay County may require the use of dual mode antennas to be used, including by two different carriers, unless it can be proven that such will not work technologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service.
(D)
Tower Finish/Color: Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
(E)
Lighting: If lighting is required, Applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under State and Federal regulations. All towers requiring lighting shall be lighted so as to effectively eliminate the ground scatter effect of the lighting and so as to prevent the light from being seen from the ground.
(F)
Flush Mounting: All new or replacement antennas, except omni directional whip antennas, shall be flush-mounted on any tower or other structure, unless the Applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable. If not flush-mounted, the antennas shall be attached so as to create smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances, unless it can be proven that to do so would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the service.
(G)
Placement on BuildingโFacie: If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the facia of the building and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances involved.
(H)
LightingโPreventing Ground Scatter Effect: For any Wireless Facility for which lighting is required under the FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 12 degrees vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
(I)
In the event a tower that is lighted is modified, at the time of the modification the Clay County may require that the Tower be retrofitted with the technology set forth in the preceding subsection (F).
