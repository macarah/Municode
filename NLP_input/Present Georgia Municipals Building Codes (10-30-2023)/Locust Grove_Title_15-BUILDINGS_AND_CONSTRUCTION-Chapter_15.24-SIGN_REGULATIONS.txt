Chapter 15.24 - SIGN REGULATIONS
Sections:

15.24.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is set out as follows herein.
A.
A comprehensive regulation is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth in Locust Grove and Henry County in general and because a major interstate highway runs through the city and attracts a multitude of signs, thereby leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values.
B.
To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
C.
Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city.
D.
Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council imposes the regulations contained in this chapter.
E.
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intends by enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter to:
1.
Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
2.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city;
3.
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
4.
Maintain the historical image of the city;
5.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
6.
Promote economic development; and
7.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

D.
Variances. This subsection shall provide the exclusive procedures for granting variances to the requirements of this chapter.
1.
Upon application by the property owner of a lot zoned OI, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 or M-2, covering more than ten contiguous acres, the city council may grant a variance to allow the aggregate signable area to exceed five hundred square feet where the applicant has shown that:
a.
All signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this chapter; and
b.
The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, nor would it impair the purpose and intent of this chapter; and
c.
The city council shall consider at least one of the following factors:
i.
The size of buildings constructed on the subject lot;
ii.
The potential to subdivide the lot; or
iii.
The number of different tenants occupying the buildings; and
d.
Financial Loss to the Applicant. However, such loss is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to justify a variance.
Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted.
2.
Signs will be of traditional materials, such as wood, glass, copper, corrugated "tin," bronze, or combinations thereof. Sandblasted wood signs are permitted. Printed/molded plastic, plywood, adhesive letters or unfinished wood are prohibited.
3.
Upon application by the property owner of a lot with property described in Section 15.24.140, the city council may grant a height variance where the applicant has shown that:
a.
All signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this chapter;
b.
The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, nor would it impair the purpose and intent of this chapter;
c.
The city council shall consider at least one of the following factors:
i.
The size of buildings constructed on the subject lot;
ii.
The potential to subdivide the lot; or
iii.
The number of different tenants occupying the buildings; and
d.
Financial Loss to the Applicant. However, such loss is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to justify a variance.
Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted.
4.
Upon application by the owner of a lot, the city council may grant a variance to allow a temporary sign to be placed on a lot for an additional ninety days.
a.
The applicant shall, in writing, state the purpose of the request and show that:
i.
All temporary signs on the lot are in conformance with this chapter;
ii.
All other signs and structures on this lot are in conformance with this chapter;
iii.
There are no other existing signs on the property which may be used in lieu of a temporary sign; and
iv.
Any other reason which may justify the requested variance;
b.
The city council shall consider one or more of the following factors:
i.
Whether the applicant has provided the required information in his or her application;
ii.
Whether the requested variance, if granted, would cause a substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, or would impair the purpose and intent of this chapter;
iii.
Whether there are existing signs on the 1ot and whether any of those signs could be used in lieu of granting this variance;
iv.
The financial loss to the applicant; however, such loss is not sufficient grounds by itself to justify a variance;
v.
Whether the peculiar conditions or circumstances, which underline the variance request, are the actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property, since such actions shall not be considered as grounds to justify a variance;
vi.
The size of the buildings constructed on the potential lot;
vii.
The potential to subdivide the lot; and
viii.
The number of different tenants occupying the building.
c.
The variance granted pursuant to this subparagraph shall terminate automatically on expiration of the time period granted; transfer of any interest to a non-applicant in the lot upon which such variance was granted; or subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted.
d.
A variance under this subparagraph may be granted no more than two times per lot per calendar year. This limitation shall apply to all lots created by subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was originally granted.
e.
All variances shall be heard by the city council. Variance hearings shall be conducted in accordance with standards of the zoning ordinance, provided that the standards in paragraph 1 above shall be utilized as the basis for decision on a variance application, and provided further that final decision on all variance applications shall be made and communicated in writing to the applicant no later than sixty days from date of application.

15.24.090 - Unsafe and unlawful sign.
A.
The section shall be enforced by the community development director, or his designee. The community development director shall have full authority to remove, without notice to the owners thereof, and impound for a period of five business days:
(1)
Signs located on a publicly owned street or highway right-of-way; or
(2)
Signs located on city property that are attached to trees, fence posts, telephone and utility poles, or other natural features.
B.
The community development director shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective signs or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this chapter.
C.
For signs erected or maintained in violation of the standards of this chapter, the community development director shall prepare a written notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation corrected within thirty days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
D.
All notices mailed by the community development director shall be sent by certified mail and first-class mail. Any time period provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail or, if the first class mail is not returned, after three days of mailing. Alternatively, notice may be personally hand-delivered to the sign owner, and notice shall be effective on such date of hand delivery.
E.
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign if different than the property owner, and the occupant of the property. If any such person is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
F.
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the community development director ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten calendar days after receipt of notice. Such appeal shall be heard by the city council and shall be governed by the same process and time frames as provided in Section 15.24.030.N.
G.
All signs for which notice of removal is given shall be removed within ten calendar days of notice of violation or within forty-eight hours of final determination by the city of any appeals, provided that where permanent signs are installed, the time period may be extended for up to two weeks by the community development director where removal requires engagement of a sign contractor or other specialized expertise; and provided further that a sign that constitutes an imminent hazard to life may be removed by the city pursuant to subsection (I) without further delay.
H.
Any sign removed by the community development director pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
I.
When it is determined by the community development director that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with the sign owner or building owner, no written notice will have to be served. In this emergency situation, the community development director shall document the imminent danger and his or her attempts to contact the sign owner, and may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner.
J.
If it is necessary for the community development director to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, he may sell the same at public or private sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the cost of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.

The owner of the sign shall secure a permit for the continuation of the sign subject to the restrictions of this section. Application for such permit must be filed within ten days of the notice of nonconformance. There shall be no charge for this permit. Failure to apply for such permit within ten days shall result in waiver of the protections afforded nonconforming signs by this section and the display of such sign shall be thereafter unlawful.
2.
No change shall be made in the size of any nonconforming sign, nor shall any structural changes be made in such a sign unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
3.
Any nonconforming sign declared to be unsafe by the city council or its designated representative shall be removed or rendered safe and brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
4.
Except as provided in this chapter, any sign erected on any public property or right-of-way in violation of this chapter may be removed therefrom by duly authorized employees of the city or Henry County, and the responsible party may be cited for such violation.
B.
Except when destroyed by fire or other act of God, a nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.
C.
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of the sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this chapter.

E.
New Interstate Signs. New interstate signs shall meet the following requirements:
1.
The outside measurement of all new interstate signs shall be fourteen feet in height and forty eight feet in length, with or without trim, except that existing factory manufactured metal signs, now located within the twelve hundred foot zones set out previously and if holding a conforming state permit on December 7, 1982, are considered to be conforming with respect to size requirements until such time as the interstate sign is moved, enlarged, raised or otherwise physically altered with respect to dimensions or changes from its present configuration or sign type.
2.
The total height of the interstate sign may not exceed seventy feet above the level of the surface of the pavement of the nearest lane of the main traveled way or seventy feet from the ground at the base of the structure to the tallest part of the structure, whichever is greater. Upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, no new permit applications shall be accepted for signs with the total height of the sign exceeding seventy feet above the level of the surface of the pavement of the nearest lane of the main traveled way or seventy feet from the ground at the base of the structure to the tallest part of the structure, whichever is greater. Permits for signs of this configuration, the applications for which were in effect prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, shall retain conforming status.
3.
Extrusions beyond the face of the sign, excluding aprons, are prohibited.
4.
Only one sign shall be allowed to face the same direction per location. This allows either a back to back sign or a "V" formation sign but prohibits two signs (side by side or stacked atop one another) facing the same direction.

Sign locations shall be no less than five hundred feet apart measuring from the two closest points.
6.
Sign structures shall be no less than ten feet from any property or right-of-way line.

A.
All ground signs shall be required to be located within the required front yard of a principal structure, and shall not be permitted to extend beyond the front property line into the street right-of-way. The location of ground signs shall not interfere with the view of any traffic control device or impede traffic vision.
B.
When the charts in Section 15.24.080 make reference to this subsection, in order to erect a second ground sign, a use must have frontage on two publicly dedicated streets with each street including a legal curb cut. In addition, there must be a minimum lot area of one-half acre to permit a second such ground sign to be erected. In those instances where one of the street frontages is on a street serving a residential subdivision, a second ground sign shall not exceed thirty-two square feet in signable area and forty-eight square feet in sign structure area. For second frontage not on a street serving a residential subdivision, the second ground sign, if permitted shall not exceed one-half of the signable area and the sign structure area.
