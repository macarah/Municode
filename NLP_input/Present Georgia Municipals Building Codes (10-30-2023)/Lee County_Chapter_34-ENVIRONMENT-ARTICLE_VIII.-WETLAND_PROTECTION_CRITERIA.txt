ARTICLE VIII. - WETLAND PROTECTION CRITERIA

Sec. 34-281. - Purpose and applicability.
The quality of urban and rural streams reflects the quality of land management and land development activities within the watershed. Reducing the amount of disturbance and impervious surfaces adjacent to watercourses is one of the best methods to reduce the quantity of non-point source pollutants in these watercourses and wetlands; this is done by allowing stormwater pollutants to infiltrate the soil before they reach the water resource. Conventional zoning ordinances generally do not mitigate these problems to a sufficient degree, and therefore, are not considerate enough of the impacts on environmental resources, and, in turn, the quality of life and health of the community's residents.
Zoning of the built environment generally requires setbacks for buildings and rights-of-way for streets and roads. However, wetlands and streams do not enjoy the same protection. These resources not only serve natural systems, but directly affect the quality of life of the human environment by providing clean water, a critical element of human health, economy, and general well-being.
These streams and wetlands do not exist apart from their surrounding upland areas. They are intertwined in a dynamic link to create balance in a natural system. Therefore, as part of an overall watershed protection strategy, it is not enough to protect the "wet" areas of wetlands and streams. Protection must also be extended to the contiguous upland areas of those hydric systems as well.
Protection should be provided all natural streams and wetlands in Lee County. Streams to be buffered will be identified as the first solid blue line on a 7.5 minute, U.S.G.S. Quadrangle Map. Freshets and intermittent streams will not be included in the ordinance. All jurisdictional wetlands will be buffered, and will be identified by at least one of the following:
(1)
The "Central Dougherty Plain Advance Identification of Wetlands" (U.S. EPA) Draft Technical Summary Document;
(2)
Those wetlands identified by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' documents, or by private contractor, certified in wetland delineation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
(3)
The National Wetlands Inventory published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Sec. 34-282. - Buffers and permitted uses.
A lateral, three-tier system shall establish buffer width, and shall permit increasing levels of activities within the stream or wetland buffer zone. These zones are established as follows:
(1)
The "streamside zone" protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem. The vegetative target is mature riparian forest that can provide shade, leaf liner, woody debris and erosion protection to the stream. The width shall be 25 feet (100 feet on rivers with a mean annual flow of 400 cfs or more, per the requirements of the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act, 1991), measured from each stream bank ("bank" being defined as that adjacent, uppermost part of the land adjacent to the watercourse that serves to contain it). This distance equals about one or two mature tree's growth from the streambank.
Land use in this zone shall be highly restricted, and shall be strictly limited to stormwater channels, footpaths, and a few utility or roadway crossings. In this zone, those areas previously developed or improved will be hereafter undisturbed; vegetation in this zone will be left to develop, eventually creating a mature forest typical of this region and soil conditions.
(2)
The "middle zone" extends from the outward boundary of the streamside zone, and shall be 25 feet wide. The functions of the middle zone is to protect key components of the stream and provide further distance between upland development and the stream. The vegetative target for this zone is also mature forest, but some clearing may be allowed for stormwater management, access, and recreational uses.
A wider range of activities and uses are allowed within this zone, e.g., recreation, bike paths, and stormwater BMPs.
(3)
The "outer zone" can practically be considered the "buffer's buffer," and shall be an additional 25-foot setback from the outer edge of the middle zone to the nearest permanent structure. In most instances, the outer zone will be a residential backyard. The vegetative target for the outer zone is usually turf or lawn. However, the property owner is encouraged to plant trees and shrubs in this area, thereby increasing the total width of the buffer.
Very few uses are restricted in this zone. Gardening, lawns, etc are promoted in this zone, but septic systems and permanent structures are prohibited.
In the event that a landowner disputes a determination by the county concerning buffer width and/or identification of the stream "bank," the property owner has the option of retaining a wetland scientist and/or a certified land surveyor to delineate the buffer widths and distances. Unless the county determines that such determination is invalid, the county shall be bound by such determination.
(Res. No. LD05-A052, 9-23-2005)
Sec. 34-283. - Hardships.
Property owners may make use of three mitigation options if they feel they have been unduly impacted by the provisions above. The use of any such option shall be approved by the county as part of the permitting process for the development. Such options are as follows:
(1)
Buffer averaging. This approach allows some flexibility in the width of the buffer, as long as the streamside zone is not impacted. Where the width of the buffer must be compromised on one part of the property, the width will be made up in another part; that is, the buffer may be wider at the mitigation point, and narrower at the variance point.
(2)
Density compensation. This method grants a developer a credit for additional density elsewhere on the site, in compensation for developable land that has been lost due to the buffer requirement. Developable land is defined as the portion of buffer area remaining after the wetland, streamside, or steep slope areas has been subtracted. Credits will be granted when more than five percent of developable land is consumed by the buffers. The density credit is accommodated at the development site by allowing greater flexibility in setbacks, frontage distances, or minimum lot sizes to squeeze in "lost lots." For example, if otherwise approved, cluster developments would also allow the developer to recover lots that cannot be used for construction due to buffers.
(3)
Conservation easements. Landowners may be afforded the option of protecting lands within the buffer by means of a perpetual conservation easement. The easement conditions the use of the buffer, and may be donated to a land trust or similar legal entity. Alternatively, the conservation easement can be donated to the county if the county agrees to accept such donation. In order for this provision to become a bona fide option, the county, or some other appropriate agency or legal entity, must organize and continually administer a land trust.
No hardship mitigation option shall be authorized which would result in the violation of the requirements of any development, zoning, or other ordinance of the county.
(Res. No. LD05-A052, 9-23-2005)
Sec. 34-284. - Appeals.
Property owners may request a variance from these provisions through the process outlined in chapter 70 of the Lee County Code of Ordinances. Applicants for such variance must demonstrate that the applicant will suffer severe economic hardship, or must show the existence unique circumstances applicable only to the subject property, which make it impractical or impossible to meet the buffer requirements. "Severe economic hardship" shall mean that the buffer requirements make the applicant's entire proposed development economically worthless or renders the applicant's property not subject to any type of development.
