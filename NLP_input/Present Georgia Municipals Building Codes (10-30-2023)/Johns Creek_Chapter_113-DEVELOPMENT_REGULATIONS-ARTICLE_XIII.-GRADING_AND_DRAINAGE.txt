Walls for stormwater facilities (retaining wall permit required). Retaining walls that are proposed for the purpose of a stormwater detention must be designed to demonstrate that the walls are capable of a hydrostatic load as measured from the top of the foundation footing to the highest elevation along the top of the wall. The hydrological design must allow for a free board dimension of one foot and an emergency overflow capacity equal to the allowable peak discharge for the 100-year storm event. The routing calculations should not take into account the existence of the emergency overflow. Place the overflow device above the projected 100-year flood elevation within the detention area.
Where the walls are located within a fenced stormwater facility no handrails shall be required along the top of the wall.
Where no fencing of the facility has been required and the wall exceeds four feet in height (as measured from top of wall to normal water level or pond bottom for dry facilities), a handrail or other suitable barrier, approved by the director, shall be provided along the top of the wall. The director may require handrails, or other suitable barriers, for wall heights of less than four feet where, in the opinion of the director, conditions exist that pose a safety hazard.

Whenever a stormwater management report indicates that an adverse impact from stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be provided with stormwater detention facilities. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post developed discharge velocities and/or flows, up to and including the 100-year storm event, 24-hour storm event, exceed those determined for the pre-developed conditions or where the downstream conditions indicated that the design flow exceeds the conveyance capacity of the receiving facility or potentially creates flooding conditions in downstream structures.
b.
Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed in accordance with these regulations and the city stormwater management ordinance so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line are no greater than those which occurred at the same location under pre-developed conditions.
c.
Peak flow rate and velocity control shall normally be provided as required by the city's stormwater management ordinance. however, under certain conditions, the 100-year event must also be detained to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the 100-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption.
d.
Stormwater detention facilities shall be provided, unless the registered professional engineer provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion that at least one of the following is true and correct:
1.
The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility which has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis which shows that detention is not required; or,
2.
Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake without crossing off-site properties and the following conditions are met:
i.
Conveyance systems on the project site are adequately designed or sufficient in their existing conditions to transport the undetained flows without further degredation; and
ii.
The downstream analysis, using timing of the hydrographs, shows no adverse impacts from the exit of the site to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin area.
e.
Should the authorized registered professional conclude that stormwater detention may not be necessary, rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory:
1.
A stormwater management report shall always be required whether or not stormwater detention is required.
2.
If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the department staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project.
3.
At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings as follows:
i.
The affected stream must be analyzed downstream from the project to a point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin. The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements/strucutres, and any other existing modifications to natural conditions;
ii.
If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs; and
iii.
If there are any existing drainage complaints downstream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs.
f.
Where it is determined by the analysis required by this section that stormwater detention is not required it should not be interpreted as a waiver of channel protection and water quality requirements.
g.
All stormwater detention/retention structures (both above and below ground) shall be located outside of building setbacks and zoning buffers.
(4)
Extended detention. Extended detention shall normally be provided in accordance with the requirements of the city stormwater ordinance.

(6)
Off-site upstream conditions.
a.
Culvert, pipe system and open channel design. All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed in accordance with the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed in accordance with the land use plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flow by routing the developed flows through any stormwater facility included in the analysis rather than assuming that a reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that the detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and that the storage volume and outlet structure configuration used in the routing analysis is based on current conditions.
b.
Detention facility design. When determining the offsite flow rates contributing to a stormwater detention facility the flows from off-site areas shall be based on the existing conditions, including all existing lakes, ponds and detention facilities.
(7)
Allowable flow. The allowable flow (AF) shall be calculated as: AF = (Existing Conditions Flow) - 0.5*(Development Ratio)*(Existing Conditions Flow - Natural Conditions Flow). The analysis shall include the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year storms. If the site has more than one discharge point, the allowable flow shall be calculated from each discharge point based on the area of the site draining to the discharge point.
Existing conditions flow shall be defined as the flow discharged from a site based on site conditions at the time the development permit is applied for. The existing conditions used to establish the flow rates and velocities shall include all on-site lakes, ponds, or detention facilities. Existing conditions flows shall be determined by routing the flows through these stormwater facilities.
Natural conditions flow shall be defined as the flow discharged from a totally forested site in good condition with a curve number of 55.
Development ratio shall be defined as the percentage of the site area to be developed divided by the total site area.
If it is determined by the director that the existing conditions downstream of the project site warrant further protection, the director shall require the existing conditions analysis to assume that the site is in totally forested and good condition with a curve number of 55.

The fence shall be a minimum of six feet high and made of a durable material with a ten-foot wide access gate. The fence shall comply with all applicable zoning requirements.
(10)
Temporary facilities. Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the approved plans and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, micro pool or constructed wetland, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until the feature has become a functional stormwater management facility.
(11)
Redevelopment and the use of existing stormwater facilities.
a.
When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18 months prior to the new development's submittal, the engineer shall provide one of the following.

Evidence of acquisition of applicable non-local permits. The applicant may be required to provide documentation that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the stormwater management report.
(13)
Stormwater facility location criteria.
a.
For purposes of these regulations, a stormwater facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any forebay or energy dissipation devices.
The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the extent of the facility is defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the facility is a wet pond or lake, the area within the maximum design ponding limits is reduced to a few feet inside the normal pool elevation, and easements are provided on the perimeter properties to allow for flooding, access and maintenance around the lake. In addition, granting of the modification shall only be considered when the wet pond is an amenity and under no circumstances shall the dam and outlet structure lie on private property that is not in some form of common ownership.
b.
Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on the project site that by-passes the facility.
c.
No portion of any stormwater facility shall disturb any required buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area.
d.
The 100-year ponding limits of a stormwater facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way.
e.
Stormwater facilities may be located within or encroach upon utility easements or utility rights-of-way upon receipt by the department of written permission from both the property and utility owners.
f.
Stormwater facilities may be constructed within recreation areas if the following criteria are met:
1.
Ownership of the area will be held by a qualified property owner's association, homeowners association, or other private parties.
2.
Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the stormwater facility.
3.
Stormwater facilities within active recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature.
4.
Permanent stormwater features shall not interfere with the intended used of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a ditch or large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure shall not be in a tennis court, etc.).
g.
A residential subdivision of more than three lots that is required by these regulations or the stormwater management ordinance to provide stormwater management facilities shall locate those facilities on an individual lot of record within the development. Lots created within a development project to accommodate detention and retention facilities which are incidental, related, appropriate, and clearly subordinate to the main use in the project are exempt from the minimum lot size requirements in all zoning districts. No other construction/building is permitted on this lot and the lot shall be owned by the homeowners association or the owners of the lots of record being served by this facility. The lot shall have a minimum of 20 feet of public or private road frontage. Access to the facility shall be located on this lot and shall be provided in a manner which allows for access and maintenance of the facility. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat.
h.
A nonresidential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site stormwater facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by a stormwater facility that provides detention and/or water quality for more than one property owner or is located off-site shall enter into a maintenance agreement acceptable to the city for the facility's maintenance. However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners' association.
(14)
Stormwater facility access requirements.
a.
In both residential and non-residential projects, an easement at least 20 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention facilities from a public or private street. The access easement shall conform to the following requirements:

The access easement shall be cleared, grubbed and graded so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction vehicles.
2.
The minimum drive surface width shall be 15 feet.
3.
The drive shall be grassed or paved.
4.
The maximum slope shall be 30 percent.
5.
Access easements may be combined with drainage easements containing an open channel; however, the combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the drive.
6.
A drive to the bottom of the pond shall be provided when the facility is over ten feet deep from the bench elevation or the facility is wider than 50 feet as measured from bench to bench.
7.
Where the facility is completely enclosed by walls, an access ramp, ladder or stairs shall be provided into the facility to allow for inspection and maintenance activities.
b.
Every normally-dry stormwater basin, lake, or parking lot detention facility shall be completely enclosed within a drainage/access easement. The drainage/access easement shall extend at least ten feet beyond the 100-year flooding limits of the stormwater facility and shall encompass any dam, outlet structure and energy dissipation devices.

Where no property owners association exists or where the association has disbanded it shall be the responsibility of all lots within the subdivision that drain to the stormwater facility to provide ongoing inspection and maintenance pursuant to these and other applicable city regulations.
c.
In a nonresidential project with an on-site stormwater facility which serves only that project, the property owner shall be responsible to maintain the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
d.
Where no maintenance covenant has been recorded, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater management pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
e.
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project). the owner shall submit a detailed schedule of long-term maintenance and inspection activities. This schedule of activities shall be incorporated into a maintenance covenant signed by the property owner. The schedule shall describe all maintenance and inspection activities and the parties responsible. The maintenance covenant shall be in a form acceptable to the city and shall be recorded in the deed records of the clerk of superior court.
(16)
Stormwater facility certification and as-built drawings. When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified as-built drawing of each stormwater facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia.
Based on the actual parameters established on the as-built drawing, an addendum to the stormwater management report shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of these regulations. The amended or as-built stormwater management report shall be certified by the authorized registered professional. Any deviations from the original design shall be clearly noted as well as any impact, if any, these deficiencies may have on the operational characteristics of the facility
The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The as-built drawing and addendum to the stormwater management report shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project).
The as-built drawing shall show the following information. Where elevations or dimensions are shown on the as-built, the original design data should be shown and struck-through with the actual as-built data indicated next to that:

Parking lot detention facilities.
a.
Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types:
1.
Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations;
2.
Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section.
b.
Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives.
c.
The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm.

In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the Georgia State Building Code as may be amended by the city.
(19)
Sediment basins.
a.
Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams/and or sediment basins.
b.
Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility.
c.
In cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, under cutting of the basin will not be permitted.
d.
The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with appendix C of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia."
e.
Trapping of sediment in state waters shall not be allowed.
(20)
Ponds and lakes not used for detention. In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development, but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same general and specific criteria contained in these regulations shall apply, but may be modified in instances where a specific requirement is clearly detention oriented rather than safety-based.

In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. corrugated metal pipe is not permitted for standpipes.
3.
Spillways: Every dam shall be provided with a principal spillway, fully capable of passing at least the 50-year flood, with excess spillway capacity provided by the emergency spillway(s) capable of handling excess flows up to the design storm. The principal spillway can be sized for floods of less magnitude than the 50-year flood only if the emergency spillway is appropriately armored against scour with concrete or other suitable lining as protection against more frequent usage.
4.
Principal spillway: All spillways shall be analyzed (hydraulically rated) for both inlet and outlet control conditions using appropriate tail-water ratings. If a control-box or weir-box is affixed, then the coral system (inlet control box and outlet conduit) shall be hydraulically rated to determine the stage-discharge relationship.
5.
Emergency spillway(s): For every type of water impounding facility a planned safe flow path must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in an emergency. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways may be excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete or weir sections of concrete walls, or, appropriately designed conduit.

Principal spillway shall be adequate to handle at least the 25-year flood.
iv.
Emergency spillway(s) shall be provided to handle flows in excess of the 25-year flood, up to the 100-year flood.
v.
Where fencing is required by subsection 113-166(9) the fence shall not extend across the emergency spillway in such a manner as to create a possible clogging hazard.
2.
Earthen dam.
i.
Front slope shall not be steeper than 2.5:1 unless design includes a slope stability analysis that confirms and documents a steeper slope will be stable. In no condition, however, can any slope be steeper than 2: 1.
ii.
All organics and topsoil shall be removed from the entire footprint of the dam and the foundation inspected and approved by the city prior to fill placement.
iii.
Earthen fill shall be CL or ML material approved for use by geotechnical engineer (PE) and placed and compacted to not less than 95 percent standard proctor under said engineer's direction.
iv.
Freeboard of dam above the 100-year design storm maximum pool shall be two feet in lieu of fetch calculations of wave height justifying a lesser freeboard. The city reserves the right to require additional freeboard above the nominal two-feet requirement if supported by fetch calculations.
v.
Crest width shall be not less than eight feet, unless approved by the department.
vi.
Embankments shall be protected from erosion by appropriate vegetation, rip rap, paving or some other type of protective surface and maintained in a safe condition. In appropriate vegetation such as trees or shrubs and hedges that may obscure inspection of the dam shall not be allowed or shall be removed. A qualified professional shall be consulted prior to the removal of trees over four-inch dbh or where the removal of any trees may endanger the function or stability of the dam.
3.
Gravity dam (reinforced concrete or masonry).
i.
Design shall address and account for overturning uplift, and seepage with adequate safety factor, and adequate freeboard.
ii.
All slab on grade concrete, including concrete footings, shall be designed and constructed to incorporate appropriate cutoff walls.
iii.
Under no condition, can any fill slope (if any) be steeper than 2:1.
iv.
All organics and top soil shall be removed from the entire footprint of the dam and the foundation inspected and approved by the city prior to gravity dam concrete or masonry placement.
v.
Earthen fill (if required) shall be approved for use by geotechnical engineer (PE) and placed and compacted to not less than 95 percent standard proctor under said engineer's direction.
vi.
Freeboard of dam above the 100-year design storm maximum pool shall be two feet along any earth fill sections of the dam, in lieu of fetch calculations of wave height justifying a lesser freeboard. The city reserves the right to require additional freeboard above the nominal two-feet requirement if supported by fetch calculations.
(6)
Existing category II dams. When an existing category II dam may be reclassified to a category I dam because of a proposed development downstream of the dam, the following shall be provided by the developer for review by the Georgia Safe Dams Program.
a.
Location of the category II dam and the proposed development;
b.
A surveyed cross-section of the stream valley at the location of the proposed development including finished floor elevations; and
c.
A dam breach analysis using the dam break computer model to establish the height of the flood wave in the downstream floodplain. The dam break modeling shall be completed in accordance with the safe dams program quality assurance program by a qualified registered engineer.
