ARTICLE IX. - TOCCOA RIVER PROTECTION

Sec. 42-531. - Purpose of article.
(a)
Findings. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
(b)
Designation as protected river. The Toccoa River has been designated as a protected river by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Toccoa River as defined herein.
(c)
Authority. See section 42-410(c).
(d)
Jurisdiction. See section 42-410(d).
(e)
Cite. This article shall be known and cited as "Toccoa River Protection Ordinance."
(f)
Interpretation. See section 42-410(f).
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XI, art. I)
Sec. 42-532. - Toccoa River corridor protection district established.
Toccoa River corridor protection district is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Toccoa River within Fannin County and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river, even though this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Toccoa River corridor protection district map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. XI, art. II)
Sec. 42-533. - Protection criteria.
Protection criteria are as follows:
(1)
Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided herein.
(2)
A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained at all times in the river corridor, except as otherwise provided herein.
(3)
The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity.
(4)
Septic tank and septic tank drain fields are prohibited in the river corridor, except as expressly provided in subsection (5) of this section.
(5)
Single-family dwellings including the usual appurtenances are permitted in the buffer area subject to the following conditions:
a.
The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations.
b.
The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size).
c.
There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land.
d.
A septic tank or tanks serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.
e.
Septic tank drain fields shall not be located within the buffer area.
(6)
Industrial and commercial land uses existing in the river corridor prior to the initial promulgation of this article are exempt from the criteria contained herein, provided that:
a.
These uses do not impair the drinking quality of the river water.
b.
These uses meet all state and federal environmental rules and regulations.
(7)
The construction of road crossings and utility crossings is permitted in the river corridor, provided such construction meets all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975, and all applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control.
(8)
The following uses are permitted in the river corridor, provided that such uses do not impair longterm functions of the protected river or the river corridor:
a.
Timber production and harvesting, subject to the following conditions:
1.

b.
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purpose of O.C.G.A. 12-2-8.
