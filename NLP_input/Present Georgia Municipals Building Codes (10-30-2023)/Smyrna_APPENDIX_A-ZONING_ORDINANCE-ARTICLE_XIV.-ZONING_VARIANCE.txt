Sec. 1403. - Variance review standards.
In rendering its decisions, the license and variance board shall consider the following factors:
(1)
Whether there are unique and special circumstances or extraordinary and exceptional conditions applying to the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district.
(2)
Whether any alleged hardship is self-created by any person having an interest in the property nor is the result of mere disregard for or ignorance of the provisions from which relief is sought.
(3)
Whether strict application of the relevant provisions of the Zoning Code would deprive the applicant of reasonable use of the property for which the variance is sought.
(4)
Whether the variance proposed is the minimum variance, which makes possible the reasonable use of the property.
