Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 34-34(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 34-34(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection 34-34(c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-34(b)(2);
(15)
Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines, or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines, or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(17)
There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.
c.

(1)
Objective.
a.
The existing watershed protection ordinances for the city were developed pursuant to the Rules of Environmental Planning Criteria, Chapter 391-3-16, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and provides protection for the quality of the water supply to the Blue Creek Reservoir.
b.
The existing ordinance, as written, is without a mechanism for allowing alternate criteria or mitigative measures. This analysis provides mitigative criteria for the development of sites within a water supply watershed (Chapter 391-3-16.01).
c.
The rationale behind requiring a buffer on each side of a perennial stream within a water supply watershed is to protect the source water by providing a vehicle for the filtering or cleansing of stormwater discharging to a stream. In the event that the regulated buffer is violated, a mechanism for providing an equal capacity of cleansing for the stormwater discharge must be supplied.
d.
Chapter 391-3-16.01, Section 10 of the environmental planning criteria provides the legal authority for the city to review alternate or mitigative criteria with technical justification for the implementation of alternate of mitigative proposals rests with the property owner. All exceptions to this division must be submitted to the state department of natural resources, through the city for review and comment. This review must be obtained before construction plans can be reviewed for a building permit. The criteria for the development of mitigation plans is outlined in subsection (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Request for variance. If due to physical topographical or other reasons, a site can not be developed in compliance with this division, for the purpose it was zoned, the owner/developer may request a variance. Application for a variance must develop alternate methods for providing the same level of water quality protection as afforded by natural buffer and impervious surface setback required in this division. An environmental assessment report shall be prepared in accordance with the guidance documents provided by the state department of natural resources. The report shall explain how the concepts of avoidance, minimization or mitigation have been addressed in the design of the proposed project. The report shall be prepared by one or more individuals having expertise in the following areas: erosion and sediment control, soils science and mechanics, aquatic biology, hydrology and environmental/civil engineering. A statement as to the qualifications of each of the report's authors shall be included as an appendix to the environmental assessment report.
a.
Stream buffer variance. The general principal in the preservation of natural stream buffers are as follows:
1.
Design the site facilities without conflict with natural stream buffers.
2.
Relocate the stream so that the site facilities will not conflict with the natural stream buffer requirement. Relocation of a stream requires a mitigation plan approved by the state department of natural resources.
3.
A combination of site configuration and stream relocation with approved mitigation plan.
4.
In the event reduction of the 100-foot buffer is proposed as a part of a site development plan, equivalent buffer must be provided downstream of the impacted area. An approved mitigation plan must be provided.
5.
The least preferred method of developing a site with a perennial stream is to pipe the stream. The initial reaction of the regulatory agencies is to disallow the piping of a stream. Stream piping is normally not allowed because of the adverse effect on cold water microorganisms and the normal small fish population. However, if the steam is enclosed with properly jointed concrete pipe, it will protect the water quality of the stream segment from contaminated runoffs and therefore, piping may be justified. Piping will require mitigation of the lost stream buffer. Lost or reduced buffer shall be compensated for by providing replacement buffer or the construction of wetlands. Replacement buffer shall be provided at the rate of five times the disturbed buffer area. In the event wetlands are constructed in lieu of replacement buffer, the area of the constructed wetland is 2.5 times the disturbed buffer. Replacement buffer and constructed wetlands shall be set aside as conservation easement as outlined under O.C.G.A. tit. 44, ch. 10 (O.C.G.A. § 44-10-1 et seq.).
b.
Impervious surface variance. Mitigation plans for encroachment into the required 175-foot setback of impervious surfaces from a perennial stream shall be developed in accordance with the following:
1.
All impervious surfaces shall be contoured so that the stormwater runoff is direct to a "first flush" dry retention filter with a subsurface filtration system.
2.
The "first flush" of a storm event is of primary importance to water quality. This term describes the washing action that stormwater has on accumulated pollutants from impervious surfaces. This flushing creates a shock loading of pollutants. Studies have determined that the "first flush" equates to the first one-half inch of rainfall over the impervious area. This runoff carries 90 percent of the pollution load from a storm.
3.
Treatment of the first one-half inch of runoff will help minimize the effect of the stormwater on water quality.
4.
Surface oil skimming from the "first flush" unit shall be processed through an oil/water separator. Surface discharge from oil/water separators to state waters shall comply with the Rules and Regulations for Water Quality Control, state department of natural resources Chapter 391-3603(5).
(3)
Landscape plan requirements. All applications for a variance shall be prepared an contain the information as set out in this subsection. A landscape plan is required for the replacement/replanting of buffer vegetation.
a.
A landscape plan shall be prepared by a landscape architect registered in the state.
b.
The landscape plan check sheet and landscape plan shall contain the following information:
1.
Name, address and telephone number of property owner.
2.
Name, address, telephone number and seal of landscape architect who prepared the plan.
3.
Site location map, north point, scale of drawings.
4.
Show all pertinent site features: buildings, walks, drives, underground utilities, water bodies, etc.
5.
Show all property lines, distances to bodies of water and/or streams, and the limits of the natural buffer areas.
6.
Show calculations on the plan for: total area, buffer area disturbed (in acres and square feet). Indicate numbers of canopy and understory trees required by ordinance.
7.
Planting key: botanical and common name of all plant materials proposed; quantity of each species, size of plant material (caliper, height, width); condition (i.e., balled and burlapped, container grown, bare root, collected, etc.).
8.
Submit three copies of plans for review. One will be returned upon approval.
c.
A landscape plan shall include two canopy trees with a minimum trunk caliper of 2½ inches (at four inches from the ground) for every 1,000 square feet of disturbed buffer area on the site.
d.
A landscape plan shall include one understory tree with a minimum trunk caliper of one inch (at four inches from the ground) for every 1,000 square feet of disturbed buffer area on the site.
e.
Required trees shall be randomly placed so that the mature canopy covers the buffer area.
f.
All disturbed buffer areas shall be 100 percent covered with, deciduous trees, shrubs, and/or ground cover (not requiring mowing).

(Ord. of 10-16-2000, § II)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 34-202. - Purpose.
(a)
The wetlands in the city indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(c)
The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Ord. of 10-16-2000, § I)
Sec. 34-203. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(a)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(b)
The generalized wetlands map does not represent boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 10-16-2000, § III)
Sec. 34-204. - Protection criteria; requirements for local permit or permission.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the city building official or authorized representative using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corp of Engineers determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Ord. of 10-16-2000, § IV)
Sec. 34-205. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, dredging except as provided in this article. The activities listed in this section are exempted from the regulations of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual Section 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practice approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
