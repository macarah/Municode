Where a public or community sewage treatment system is to be constructed, or an existing public or community sewer is to be extended to serve a lot, or an approved on-site sewage management system is to be used, the building sewer shall be installed so that it will ensure gravity flow at a self-cleaning velocity throughout. All sinks, lavatories, basins, shower baths, laundry tubs and similar plumbing fixtures or appliances, shall be connected to a public or community sewerage system or to an approved on-site sewage management system.
(b)
On-site sewage management system construction permit required. No person shall construct, repair or alter an on-site sewage management system without obtaining a construction permit for such purpose from the health department. Written approval may be required for all minor repairs prior to work being performed. No permit or written approval for the construction, repair or alteration of an on-site sewage management system shall be granted until the town or county health department has inspected and approved the site, proposed location and design of the system. A fee shall be charged for a permit application. No person may begin the physical development of a lot or structure thereon, where an on-site sewage management system will be utilized, nor install a new on-site sewage management system without having first applied for and obtained from the town or county health department a construction permit for the installation.
(c)
Excavations, permanent surfaces and multiple structures. No person shall excavate nor utilize any hole or pit for the purpose of disposing of and burying any type of debris including site cleared material (i.e., logs, stumps), building materials, etc., on any lot or portion thereof which is proposed for development with an on-site sewage management system or where there is an existing system. Only areas preapproved by the health department and any other appropriate governmental jurisdiction for excavation and use of as a trash or debris pit as indicated on the permit to construct an on-site system shall be allowed as an exception to this regulation. All swimming pools, permanent surfaces and other permanent structures where individual on-site sewage management systems are existing or proposed shall be approved by the health department prior to construction.
(d)
Requirements for on-site sewage management system construction permit issuance or denial. On-site sewage management system construction permits for conventional septic tank systems shall be issued only after a site inspection by the health department shows favorable findings relative to percolation rates, (or a certified soil scientist's report may be accepted in lieu of percolation test results) soil characteristics, groundwater, rock and any other factors which would affect the acceptability of the lot. For construction of conventional septic tank systems, the suitability of the lot must be demonstrated through acceptable soil characteristics and/or percolation rates of less than or equal to 90 min/inch; freedom from groundwater interference or other potential for contamination of groundwater by sewage; absence of impervious strata below the level of the absorption field and absence of undesirable topographic characteristics and other factors which singly, or in combination, affect the acceptability of the lot. Lot suitability and approval for other types of on-site sewage management systems is to be determined by criteria established by the department's manual. The town or county board of health may deny or revoke an on-site sewage management system construction permit upon finding the lot unsuitable or for failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of these rules. Such denial shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5. On-site sewage management construction permits shall remain valid for not more than 12 months from the date of issuance.

The minimum tank size required for single-family dwellings with one or two bedrooms shall be 750 gallons, dwellings with three and four bedrooms shall be 1,000 gallons and dwellings with five bedrooms shall be 1,500 gallons. Total tank capacity will be increased by 250-gallon increments for each additional bedroom over five. Use of garbage grinders is not recommended in conjunction with on-site sewage management systems. If a grinder is to be utilized, then an additional 50 percent tank storage capacity shall be required (i.e., 500 gallons more for a 1,000-gallon system). The maximum tank capacity for a nonresidential on-site sewage management system shall be 10,000 gallons.
(d)
Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the town or county board of health.
(e)
Tank in series. The town or county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank.
(f)
Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level on a foundation of solid unexcavated ground (no fill) that will prevent settling. Backfill shall be free of voids, stumps, broken masonry or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is required with a maximum cover of 24 inches to maintain serviceability unless otherwise approved by the health department.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-6; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-32. - Distribution boxes, dosing tanks and pumps.
(a)
Distribution boxes.
(1)
Minimum design and construction. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and this section. (See pages N-3 and N-5 of the Manual.) Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 16-31.
(2)
Foundation. The foundation for distribution boxes shall be a four-inch thick concrete pad at least 12 inches beyond the wall of the distribution box.
(3)
Capacity. The box shall be of sufficient capacity to temporarily store the effluent from the dosing tanks or effluent pumps during redistribution to the absorption trenches. The maximum liquid level shall be no less than four inches below the top of the box (bottom of the lid).
(b)
Dosing tank. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed and installed in accordance with the department's current manual.
(c)
Sewage effluent pump. In the event that the sewage generated from a building or residence cannot be plumbed to an absorption field by gravity, then an on-site sewage management system may be modified by installing a sewage effluent pump (includes a grinder pump, if they discharge to an approved septic tank) with the necessary appurtenances as determined by the health department. Included but not limited to the following appurtenances are: a separate pump chamber from the septic tank, pump controls, level control malfunction, manhole cover, emergency bypass plumbing with 50 feet of drainline trench (minimum 36 inches wide), piping, fittings, alarms and distribution box for pump discharge prior to entering absorption field. All wiring shall be installed underground meeting electrical codes. All material specifications, warranties and construction plans must be submitted by the owner or agent for the owner and reviewed and approved by the health department, prior to issuance of a permit to construct the on-site sewage management system. Design and construction shall be in accordance with the specifications and details in the current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management System.
(d)
In the event that a sewage effluent pump is utilized in a residential or commercial on-site sewage management system, a minimum of 50 feet of drainline and 36 inches trench width shall be constructed and used for emergency overflow in case the pumps malfunction or electrical power is temporarily interrupted.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-7)
Sec. 16-33. - Absorption field.
(a)
Area computation. The determination of the absorption trench bottom area to be required shall be based upon both the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow from the proposed facility and upon the characteristics of the soil in which the absorption field is to be located. Soil characteristics shall include percolation rates determined by the Modified Taft Engineering Center method (or certified soil scientist's reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation tests) together with types of soil encountered, drainage conditions and other related data that may be required by the health department.
(1)
Residential lots.
a.
Trench bottom areas for residential on-site sewage management systems shall not be less than those shown below:
EXPAND
Average Percolation
Test Rate Absorption Trench
Bottom Area Per Bedroom
(Existing Proposed) in Square Feet
1—45 minutes per inch 300
46—65 minutes per inch 375
66—90 minutes per inch 450
  b.
Two or more systems serving the same residence or building may require additional absorption trench area compared to that required for a single system.
(2)
Commercial development. Total absorption trench bottom are for nonresidential, on-site sewage management systems shall not be less than the area obtained by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow (gallons) by the percolation coefficient i.e., (one-fifth of the square root of the average percolation rate) (e.g., one-fifth percolation rate X gal. = total absorption trench bottom area). The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined in accordance with the sewage flow schedule, Table D in section 16-43, or if a commercial facility is not included on the schedules, then a study will be made to determine what similar commercial facilities have as daily sewage flow. The maximum total absorption trench bottom area for a nonresidential/commercial on-site sewage management system shall be 9,000 square feet. The minimum size nonresidential/commercial on-site sewage management system shall include at least a 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench bottom area.
(b)
Location.
(1)
No absorption field shall be installed within the minimum separation distances indicated in Table C set out at the end of this chapter from the referenced items (existing or proposed), nor in areas with unsuitable fill material.
(2)
Absorption fields shall not be installed where groundwater or adverse geological formations may interfere with the absorption of treated sewage or result in the contamination of groundwater. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas subject to excessive surface water, ponding or runoff, including but not limited to stormwater and discharge from building gutters. Absorption fields shall not be installed where grade exceeds 20 percent. The health department, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances due to adverse conditions such as topography, subsurface soil characteristics, and/or groundwater sources. No part of the absorption field shall ever be covered by buildings, pavement or be used for vehicular traffic or parking. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be within ten feet of a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe.
(c)
Minimum design and construction for conventional systems. Absorption trenches shall be on grade throughout, shall be no less than 25 inches, nor more than 48 inches in depth, shall be 36 inches in width (unless otherwise approved in writing by the health department prior to installation) and shall enable placement of at least 13 inches of backfill on top of gravel bed. If unfavorable soil conditions (i.e., high clay content) are encountered at normal installation depths, trenches may be installed at greater depths if approved by the health department, site modifications are performed, acceptable percolation test rates can be shown to exist at these depths, and the soil meets all requirements for installation of absorption fields with respect to work, groundwater elevations and other geological factors. Absorption trenches shall be spaced not less than seven feet apart between trench walls. Perforated pipe shall be laid in the center of the trench with perforations oriented toward the bottom of the trench and appropriate fittings used where needed. Pipe crossings under roadways or paved areas shall not be considered in determining the total absorption trench bottom area. If trash pits are encountered during construction, then an absorption trench bypass must be installed in accordance with Detail B meeting the approval of the health department. Aggregate shall be placed under the absorption line to a minimum depth of six inches and shall extend the full width of the trench and two inches of aggregate shall cover the absorption line (total depth of aggregate shall be a minimum of 12 inches). Excavation for absorption trenches in wet clay soils and smearing of trench walls and bottoms should be avoided so that permeability will not be reduced. Approvals may be withheld where such damage has occurred. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas where percolation test rates exceed 90 minutes per inch.
(d)
Field layout methods. Absorption fields shall be designed and installed in accordance with one of the following methods:
(1)
Distribution box method. The distribution box method may be used on level or moderately sloping topography, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches, but not more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. Effluent lines from the septic tank, dosing tank or pump chamber shall terminate inside the distribution box via an elbow turned downward to form a submerged inlet of normal water level. Equal absorption trench lengths, not exceeding 100 linear feet shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers, consisting of schedule 40 PVC pipe. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level on a solid bed of aggregate for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with a minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer longer trenches.
(2)
Level field method. On level topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting or distribution box shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines.
(3)
Serial distribution method. When the serial distribution method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption line and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. Overflow sewers shall be nonperforated. Overflow sewer connections will be necessary, only to maintain required trench depths. A minimum of 12 inches of earth cover will be required over overflow sewers.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-8; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-34. - Privies.
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current On-Site Sewage Management System Manual.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-9; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-35. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications.
(a)
Alternative systems will be considered for use when existing conventional systems have failed and cannot be repaired by conventional methods and public or private sewers are not available. The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health.
(b)
The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the town or county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed, on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems.
(c)
When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the town or county board of health:
(1)
Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory or field data required;
(2)
Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the town or county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making the application will be informed by the town or county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy.
(d)
Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The town or county board of health may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site- and system-specific factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for the conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system.
(e)
Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage system, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The town or county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-10; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-36. - Percolation tests and test borings.
(a)
Percolation tests.
(1)
If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted, will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems.
(2)
Certified soil scientists' reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation tests, but for subdivisions, soil scientist's reports must be submitted at the preliminary stage of approval and noted on all subdivision plats.
(b)
Location and number.
(1)
Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area, such as in or near streams, floodplains, easements, embankments, gullies. All percolation test holes shall be flagged, staked and numbered in accordance with soil data record form.
(2)
Percolation test holes shall be spaced at least 50 feet apart. (Spacing may be reduced if approved by the health department.) The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be a minimum of three percolation tests performed for lots up to two acres, and two percolation tests for lots two acres and above.
(3)
The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristic of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designations, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map.
(c)
Test boring for rock, shale, hardpan and water table.
(1)
Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the town or county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service (see section 16-28). Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map unless otherwise specified by the health department. Borings will be done to six-foot depth, and for water table evaluation should be examined after at least 12 hours.
(2)
Borings shall not be located in easements, or other areas restricted by the regulation.
(d)
Notification when conducting percolation tests and borings. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the town or county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the department or town or county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a department or town or county board of health representative.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-11; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-37. - Limited sewage capacity.
(a)
Use of leased and/or easement property. The health department may waive the requirement that a property owner construct an on-site sewage management system to serve his proposed development only on his property. Easements on contiguous land may be considered for construction of an on-site sewage management system if suitable sufficient area on-site is not available and the easement is to be used exclusively for the on-site system.
(b)
County agreement for conditional sewer capacity. Completion and execution of the current specified agreement by the owner, health department and appropriate governmental jurisdiction, including notarization and recording in the county superior court clerk's office (recording-microfilming), shall be required prior to issuance of a town or county health department permit to construct a temporary on-site sewage management system and issuance of appropriate land disturbance and building permits.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-12; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-38. - Septage removal and disposal.
(a)
Septage and removal permit. No person shall engage in the removal or disposal of the contents of septic tanks, pit privies or other on-site sewage management or experimental systems without having first applied for and obtained from the town or county board of health a septage removal permit, renewed annually, for such activities. The application for such septage removal permit shall be submitted in writing on forms provided by the town or county board of health at least ten days prior to engaging in such activities. The application shall include but not be limited to: the business name and address, name and address of the applicant, the manner by which such contents are to be removed, transported and given final disposal and such other documentation as may be required by the town or county board of health, including evidence that septage removed and transported will be accepted at approved disposal sites. If surface spreading, subsurface land disposal or other method of treatment or disposal is to be used, additional information may be required.
(b)
Disposal methods. Approved methods of disposal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be:
(1)
Discharge to a public or community sewage treatment system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant;
(2)
Treatment at separate septage handling facilities; or
(3)
Direct land application.
Disposal by any of these methods shall require written permission from both the appropriate governing official, private septage handling facility owner or land owner and a representative of the town or county board of health.
(c)
Disposal of sludge.
(1)
Limitation on sludge disposal. Sludge disposal through land application is prohibited in the town unless conducted pursuant to and in full conformance with a full permit for the operation of a municipal solid waste disposal facility or municipal solid waste landfill issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-24. This prohibited use shall include both surface and subsurface application.
(2)
Definition of sludge.
a.
The term "sludge" means any solid, semi-solid or liquid waste generated from a public, municipal, commercial, private or industrial waste water treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, any pollution control facility or other waste generating facility, and includes treated sewage, stabilized sewage sludges and stabilized septage.
b.
The term "sludge" does not include reclaimed wastewater which is being discharged as part of a reuse land application system pursuant to a fully authorized and operational permit from the state department of natural resources/environmental protection division.
(d)
Vehicle identification. The name and address of the person or firm engaging in the removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems and the permit number shall be lettered on both sides of each vehicle used for septage removal purposes. Letters and numerals shall not be less than two inches in height and shall be readily visible.
(e)
Vehicle maintenance. Every vehicle used for removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be equipped with a watertight tank or body and properly maintained. Liquid wastes shall not be transported in open bodied vehicles. All pumps, hose lines, valves and fittings shall be maintained so as to prevent leakage.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-13; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993; Ord. No. 356, 6-4-1998)
Sec. 16-39. - Grease traps.
(a)
Required. Grease traps shall be required for commercial or industrial establishments with on-site sewage management systems where it is determined by the town or county board of health that grease may be introduced into the system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the system.
(b)
Design. Plans and specifications for grease traps shall be submitted to the town or county board of health for approval. Grease traps shall be designed to provide a liquid capacity of not less than 125 gallons. Effluent from grease traps shall be disposed of in septic tank and not directly discharged to the absorption field.
(c)
Construction. Grease traps shall be located, installed and constructed so that the temperature of the sewage will be reduced to permit congealing or separation of grease and easy access for cleaning is provided.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-14; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-40. - Sewage flow.
Where sizing of the on-site sewage management system is determined by sewage flow, estimates of the daily sewage flow shall not be less than the volume derived from the population to be served. Daily sewage flow shall be determined from the department's current manual; however, the flow for establishments not listed shall be determined by the town or county board of health after due consideration of data submitted by the owner or his agent on design criteria. Calculations will be made on the basis of peak flow loads and not on long term averages.
(Code 1984, § 5-2-15; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993)
Sec. 16-41. - Subdivision and mobile home parks.
(a)
Plans required. No person may sell, offer for sale, lease, rent, begin construction or otherwise begin the physical development of a subdivision or mobile home park where public or community sewage treatment systems are not available or contemplated to be available to service the proposed development until proposals and plans for the water supply and sewage disposal method to be provided or installed have been submitted to and written approval has been obtained from the town or county board of health.
(b)
Predevelopment review advised. All developers considering subdivision or mobile home park development where public or community sewage treatment systems will not be available are strongly advised to seek a predevelopment review by the town or county board of health prior to purchasing property and/or making substantial monetary outlays for development improvements. Rejection or tentative approval may be obtained at this time by submitting the following information:

(c)
Proposals and plans. Unless previously provided, subdivisions or mobile home park proposals shall be submitted on subdivision analysis forms provided by the department or the town or county board of health. Subdivisions or mobile home park plans shall be drawn to a reasonable scale, with topography depicted by two feet contour intervals; provided, however, that if ground slope is sufficiently steep for less frequent contour intervals to show the surface configurations, the town or county board of health may permit the use of lesser contour intervals. Plans shall illustrate the location of all present and proposed wells, watercourses, floodplains, water systems, sewage system, roads, structures, rights-of-way and easements on the property and within 100 feet outside the perimeter of the property. Subdivision or mobile home park plans shall also include, storm water drainage systems, elevations of seasonal high water table, location and results of test borings and percolation tests if applicable, lot identification, dimensions and building lines. The name and registration number of the preparing surveyor or engineer shall also be on the subdivision or mobile home park plans.
(d)
Soil evaluation. Data used to develop soil maps and descriptions shall be obtained from reliable sources as set forth in section 16-28(i). Where reliable soil information or the services of a soil scientist are not available, percolation tests, soil borings and such other tests as the town or county board of health may require shall be conducted.
(e)
Limits on use of on-site sewage management systems in subdivision and mobile home parks. Approval of subdivisions and mobile home parks for on-site sewage management systems shall not be granted when:
(1)
An available sewer of a public or community sewage system is within 500 feet of the subdivision or mobile home park;
(2)
Soil maps, descriptions and reports compiled by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or a soil scientist indicate that soil conditions prohibit safe development with on-site sewage management system, or the average percolation rate for the subdivision or mobile home park is more than 90 minutes per inch.
(f)
Drainage. (See pages H-1 through H-4 of the manual.) Where on-site sewage management systems are proposed for use, an adequate surface water drainage system shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Plans for drainage shall comply with local storm drainage plans and policies in effect in the town and/or county at the time of submission to the town or county board of health, and approval of drainage plans by the town council is a prerequisite to town or county board of health approval. Additionally, any changes or amendments to approved drainage plans must receive the concurrence of the governing agency, and the town or county board of health shall be provided with a written approval statement from the governing agency. In the absence of the local drainage policies, the department or town or county board of health will evaluate drainage plans and render decisions on their acceptability. Plans for internal drainage (subsurface drainage), if used, shall be submitted to the town or county board of health for consideration as to acceptability.
