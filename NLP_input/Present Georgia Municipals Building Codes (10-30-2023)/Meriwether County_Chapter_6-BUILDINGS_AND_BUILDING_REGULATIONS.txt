b.
Signs must combine numbers which are at least three inches high, and have a minimum, stroke width of one half inch against a contrasting background. The use of reflective numbers is strongly encouraged.

a.
Wherever possible, the signs shall be installed on the left side of each driveway access as determined by facing the driveway from the road.
b.
Signs must be placed within six feet of the edge of road surface and within five feet of the driveway surface, so as to clearly identify the driveway access.

e.
Signs, as described in subsection (a) of this section, may be displayed on mailbox supports below the box or on the sides of the box itself, on fence posts or gate posts, etc., only when the location of the supporting structure is on the same side of the road as the driveway, is located within six feet of the driveway, clearly identifies the driveway access, permits the sign to meet the height requirements, is installed at right angles to the road and is clearly visible to vehicles approaching from either direction on the road. Groups of mailboxes may be identified with numbers to facilitate mail delivery, but they are not acceptable to provide house numbering/driveway identification unless they stand alone and meet the criteria listed above.

b.
Each accessory unit must be identified by an additional sign meeting the above requirements. Such a sign shall be displayed at the place where the unit's access meets the driveway, or it may be affixed to the outer wall of the unit so it can be seen from the driveway, whichever placement will best clarify its location for emergency service responders. In questionable situations, the placement of the accessory building identification signs shall be approved by the community development department.
