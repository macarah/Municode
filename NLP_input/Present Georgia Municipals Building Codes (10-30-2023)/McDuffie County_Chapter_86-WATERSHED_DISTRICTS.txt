Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Feb. 4, 1998(2), did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of §§ 1—16 and 19 of said ordinance as §§ 86-21—86-37 herein was at the editor's discretion. See the history note following each section for further derivation thereof.

Sec. 86-21. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact: In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to provide for a healthy economic climate within McDuffie County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of the public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
Purpose: The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of McDuffie County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the Usry Pond Watershed, located within the jurisdiction of unincorporated McDuffie County.
