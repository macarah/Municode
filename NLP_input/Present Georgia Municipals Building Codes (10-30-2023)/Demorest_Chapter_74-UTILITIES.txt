I pertained to similar subject matter and derived from legislation included in 2007 codification and the following uncodified ordinances and provisions: Ord. No. 2012-04, § 1(Exh. A), 4-3-2012; Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1(Exh. A), 3-6-2012; Ord. of 6-17-2015, §§ 2—10. Section numbering of the provisions of Art. I has been amended by the editor to avoid conflicts.

Sec. 74-1. - Connection fees; water and sewer rates.
(a)
Authority. Authority for the mayor and city council of the City of Demorest, Georgia, to adopt this article includes, but is not limited to, powers vested in it by the State of Georgia Constitution, the City Charter of the City of Demorest, Georgia, and applicable general laws of the State of Georgia including the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965 (O.C.G.A. 36-35-1 et seq.).
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. 36-34-5, the City of Demorest as a municipal corporation has authority to construct, reconstruct, improve, better, and extend a water and sewer system, and to prescribe, revise, and collect rates, fees, tolls, or charges for the services, facilities, or commodities furnished to persons or users or made available by such systems to the property owner at such owner's property.
(b)
Relationship to connection fees and installation fees. The City of Demorest as a municipal corporation providing water and sewer service is authorized by O.C.G.A. 36-71-13(c) to collect a proportionate share of the capital cost of water and wastewater facilities by way of hook-up or connection fees as a condition of water and sewer service to new or existing customers, without complying with the provisions of the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act of 1990, O.C.G.A. 36-71 et seq.
(c)
Applicability. The Connection Fee and Installation Fee specified by this article shall apply only within the City of Demorest's Water and Sewer Service Delivery Area the boundaries of which are shown on one or more maps titled "City of Demorest Water and Sewer System" with boundaries of said area shown, which is hereby incorporated into this ordinance by reference.
(d)
Definitions. Equivalent residential unit (ERU): The ERU is a standardizing concept which allows demands for water consumption by different types of residential units and nonresidential uses to be compared to (and expressed in terms of) a single-family, detached, site-built dwelling. One ERU (equivalent residential unit) is equal to the general average water consumption of a detached, single-family, site-built dwelling which is 100 gallons per capita per day or 300 gallons per unit. The ERUs for various uses are provided in attachment "A"
(e)
System connection fee established. Individual consumers, at the time they make application for water and sewer service to the City of Demorest, shall pay to the City of Demorest a connection fee and other related fees as outlined in Attachment "B" Water and Sewer Connection Fee. For domestic water meters two inches and larger, the connection fee for sewer will be determined on projected consumption at a rate of the equivalent residential unit (ERU), as defined by this article and exhibited in attachment "C". Payment of said fee shall be in addition to required payment(s) according to any schedule of fees and charges and/or costs of meter and installation. Payment of the system connection fee shall be considered a condition of the city providing water and sewer service to said individual consumer.
Individual consumers at the time of application for water and/or sewer service shall submit sufficient information to the city administrator so that the ERU's can be calculated. At minimum such information shall include a full and complete description of the proposed land use and development activity proposed on the site served by the water and/or sewer service, including, where applicable, the square footage of building(s) and/or square footage of each use within building(s) if different.
(f)
Mixed uses and other uses not specified. If a water and/or sewer service is requested for a building with mixed uses, the fee shall be determined according to the combination of uses most closely approximating the uses listed in attachment A under the definition of equivalent residential unit provided in this article.
If the use of a building for which a water and/or sewer service is applied for is not specified in the table under the definition of equivalent residential unit (ERU) provided in this article, the city administrator shall use and apply the use listed in said table that is most nearly comparable to the proposed use.
(g)
Change or modification in use. In the case of change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of or resizing of a water and/or sewer service, or a change in certificate of occupancy, the system connection fee for such change in use, redevelopment, or modification shall be based upon the net increase in the number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) for the new use as compared to the previous use, as determined by the city administrator.
(h)
Remedy for nonpayment of system connection fee and installation fee. The Demorest Water Department may withhold installation of a water and/or sewer service or refuse to permit connection to the Demorest water and sewer system in cases where the system connection fee and installation fee required by this article has not been paid.
(i)
Penalty for omissions. If it is discovered by the city through inspection or other means that an applicant did not accurately portray the land use at the time of water meter application, and the use on a given site would require a connection fee in an amount that exceeds the equivalent residential unit specified in this ordinance which was paid for said water and/or sewer service, the City of Demorest shall bill the individual consumer for the unpaid system connection fee at a rate of 1.5 times the system connection fee that would have been required under the terms of this article for said use. After the expiration of 60 days from such notice being mailed or delivered to the individual consumer, the City of Demorest shall have the authority to withhold or discontinue future water service to the customer until the additional increment of the required system connection fee is paid.
(j)
Exemptions. The following may be exempted from payment of the system connection fee required by this article:
(1)
Application for the replacement of an existing water and/or sewer service, where there is no alteration or expansion of an existing building or use of land requiring the consumption of water, as determined by the city administrator, or where no additional demand for water system improvement facilities will result.
(2)
All or part of the system connection fee for a particular project determined by the mayor and city council as constituting extraordinary economic development, which shall be considered to mean any nonresidential development activity determined by the City of Demorest to be a positive catalyst in shaping the city's economic stability.
(k)
Refunds. A refund of a system connection fee paid to the City of Demorest as required by this article may upon application be granted by the city administrator when one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1)
If the actual gross square footage constructed after the issuance of the building permit is less than the amount specified in the application for water and/or sewer service, the applicant for the water and/or sewer service shall be entitled to a refund of the excess portion of the system connection fee.
(2)
In the event that system connection fee is paid but the water and/or sewer service or building permit for the use is abandoned, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that the fee was paid and received by the City of Demorest, and that the building permit was abandoned.
(l)
Accounting. The City of Demorest shall maintain all revenues derived from the collection of the system connection fees in a separate account.
(m)
Limitations on expenditures. Revenues collected from the system connection fees pursuant to this article shall only be expended for water and sewer system improvements within the City of Demorest service delivery area and capacity-related improvements to the water and wastewater treatment systems. Revenues from system connection fees may be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance water and sewer system improvements within the City of Demorest service delivery area or for capacity-related improvements to the water and wastewater treatment systems.

Sec. 74-3. - City's duties.
The city shall install and maintain a service line from the city's distribution line to the property line immediately adjacent to the property to be served. The city may connect to properties not adjacent to the city's lines upon payment of reasonable costs for extension of the city's water and/or sewer line to render service, but this determination shall be at the city's sole discretion. The city's meter may be installed at or near the property line or upon the property to be served within three feet of the property line at the city's discretion in accord with reasonable engineering practices. The city may refuse service if the lines upon the property to be served or the piping located thereon are installed or exist in such manner as to prevent cross connections or back flow. The city shall exercise good faith efforts to notify all customers by radio, the local newspaper, Nixle, website, or social media of any anticipated interruptions of service.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 3)
Sec. 74-4. - User's responsibility and duties.
Water furnished by the city shall be used for consumption by the user and the user's household and employees only. The user shall not sell water to any other person nor permit any other person or user to consume water provided by the city. Water provided by the city shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes, except if water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with regular domestic consumption in the area served. If a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a user, then a suitable location shall be provided by the user that is unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader. The user shall furnish and maintain a private cut off value on the user's side of the meter. The user's piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the user at the user's expense in a safe and efficient manner and in accord with regulations promulgated by the State of Georgia and any other applicable regulation. All applicants and users must offer proof that any private well located upon the property is not physically connected to the lines of the city's water system. All applicants and users covenant and agree not to permit the connection of any private wells over which the applicant/user has control to be connected to the city's water system.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 4)
Sec. 74-5. - Access to premises and extensions of systems.
Authorized agents and personnel of the city shall have access at all times to the user's premises for the limited purposes of installing or removing city property, inspecting piping, reading and testing meters, or for other purposes related to the city's water service and facilities and the city's sewer services and facilities. Extensions to the city's water or sewer system shall be made only when the user shall grant or convey or cause to be granted or conveyed to the city a permanent easement and right-of-way to cross property traversed by city water lines and sewer lines.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 5)
Sec. 74-6. - Change of occupancy.
The user shall provide notice in person or in writing at City Hall of Demorest to discontinue water and/or sewer service or to change occupancy.

The new occupant shall apply for utility service prior to occupying the premises. Any failure to notify the city shall render the new occupant responsible for the water consumed and sewer discharged since the last meter reading. The failure to notify the city to close an account may result in additional water use charges.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 6)
Sec. 74-7. - Meter reading; billings; collecting.
Bills to users of water and sewer service shall be mailed on such day or days each month as may be determined by the city. Bills shall be paid at City Hall in Demorest or at such other location designated by the city. A failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent bills from becoming delinquent or relieve the user from payment. The failure of water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following fees:
(1)
Nonpayment on the due date will be subject to a fee of ten percent of the delinquent account;
(2)
Nonpayment after two billing cycles shall result in water being disconnected from the user's property. Payment is not authorized in the field. If a disconnect work order is issued, then the disconnection crew lacks the authority to accept payment in the field;
(3)
The city may require an additional deposit to insure proper payment of water and sewer charges;
(4)
Vacant or unoccupied property may continue to receive water and sewer service. However, minimum bills and charges for water used shall continue to be due. If service is terminated, then any vacant or unoccupied property shall be treated as a new user and must apply for service and pay applicable fees;
(5)
A $35.00 fee shall be charged for all returned checks, which may also result in the disconnection of service; and
(f)
A service that has been disconnected for nonpayment shall be restored only after the outstanding invoice has been paid in full, a security deposit approved by the mayor and city council has been paid, and a reconnection fee of $40.00 paid by cash, credit card or certified funds. All disconnected accounts paid after 2:00 p.m. shall be reconnected the next business day.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 7)
Sec. 74-8. - Billing for multi-unit buildings.
(a)
All existing multi-unit buildings (including but not limited to apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and commercial buildings containing multiple tenant spaces) with a utility-owned master meter shall be billed a monthly base rate that is equivalent to the established monthly base rate for a single unit times the number of units within the building as indicated by planning and zoning approved plans, whether occupied or not, plus any excess water used above the calculated minimum charge. Any new multi-unit buildings (including but not limited to apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and commercial buildings containing multiple tenant spaces) shall have individual water utility owned meters on each unit or sub-unit meters owned and managed by the property owner with a utility owned master meter that bills for water service based on volume of use for each customer. If existing city-owned rights-of-way are not suitable for the installation of individual meters, the following conditions must be met for the installation of individual meters on private property:
(1)
The owners of all individual living units shall grant easements to the city for meter installation within ten feet of the curb line of existing rights-of-way for water mains.
(2)
The easements shall comply with water department specifications.
(3)
The owner of all individual living units shall indemnify the city against all damage claims resulting from the installation, maintenance of and access to meters on private property.
(4)

(5)
If required in lieu of dedicated streets, a 20-foot right-of-way centered on the water main shall be conveyed to the city, except that the director of the water and sewer department may accept a narrower right-of-way if obstructions require less than 20 feet.
(b)
If an owner of multi-family dwelling or complex fails to install a separate water meter for each individual dwelling unit, the water service to such customer at that address shall be discontinued until the property owner complies with the requirements of this section.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 8)
Sec. 74-9. - Suspension of service.
(a)
If water and/or sewer service is discontinued and all outstanding invoices are paid, then the security deposit shall be refunded to the user by the city. If the service is discontinued for nonpayment of invoices, then the security deposit shall be applied by the city toward the account balance. Any balance of the security deposit shall be refunded to the user according to the policy set in the user agreement. However, if the security deposit is insufficient to pay the outstanding invoice then the city may proceed to collect the balance from the user. Services disconnected for nonpayment of bills shall be restored only after the outstanding invoice is paid in full. Any user who enters the meter box and turns on the service shall be in violation of this article and subject to applicable penalties.
(b)
The city reserves the option to discontinue service without notice for the following reasons:
(1)
To prevent fraud or abuse;
(2)
Past due accounts;
(3)
Willful disregard of the city's rules and regulations;
(4)
Emergency repairs;
(5)
Insufficient water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control;
(6)
Legal processes;
(7)
Direction of public authorities; or
(8)
Strike, riot, fire, flood, unavoidable accident.
(Ord. of 6-6-2017(1), § 9)
Sec. 74-10. - Complaints; adjustments.
If the user believes a bill to be in error, then the user shall present the claim, in person, to city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. If the claim is made after the bill becomes delinquent, then any such claim shall not be effective to prevent discontinuance of the service. A user may pay a bill under protest, and such payment shall not prejudice the claim. The city shall make a special meter reading at the request of a user for a fee of $5.00. If the special reading discloses that the meter was misread, then no charge shall be due, and any payment shall be refunded to the user. A water meter shall be tested for the production of a data log at the user's request upon payment to the city in the amount of $30.00. If the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent of the correct volume, then no charge shall be due from the user, and any charge shall be refunded to the user. If the seal of a meter is broken by someone other than the city's authorized agent or employee or if the meter fails to register correctly or if stopped by any cause, then the user shall pay an amount estimated based upon the record of previous bills to the location and/or other proper data. Disputed bills shall be paid in full, and a request for adjustment shall be submitted to the city clerk. An adjustment to the bill will be determined according to internal policy.

(Ord. of 7-14-2011, § 1)
Sec. 74-13. - Perfection of lien; notice.
