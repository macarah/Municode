ARTICLE 4.15 - C-O, CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT

4.15.1 - Purpose, intent, and authority.
1)
Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within certain designated transportation corridors.
The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the corridor overlay district.
(a)
All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area.
(b)
The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments.
(c)
Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted.
(d)
Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
(e)
Any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings.
(f)
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.
2)
Statement of intent. These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent, and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the selected transportation corridors.
Originally, a public meeting was held on March 18, 2004 in an effort to seek citizen preference regarding current growth and development patterns in Paulding County. An additional public hearing was held for this amendment on January 24, 2006. Public information was obtained in 2004 through a Visual Preference Survey (VPS). The survey allowed citizens an opportunity to state whether they liked a photo of a development or disliked it based on design standards. Those citizens that provided input through the VPS expressed an interest in promoting developments that will allow Paulding County to grow in positive, sustainable patterns. These standards include regulatory control and design of building development and materials, parking areas, signage, transportation (pedestrian and vehicular), greenspace and trees/vegetation.
3)
Authority. Authority underlying creation of the corridor overlay zones district is provided for in O.C.G.A. Section 36-66-2, Section 11 of the Paulding County Enabling Legislation and the Paulding County Code of Ordinances, 2003 Zoning Ordinance, Article XV.
4)
Statement of significance.
(a)
State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) traverses the county from the east to the southwest providing access to Cobb County and Haralson County. State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) is a divided, four-lane with median from the Cobb County line to its intersection and convergence with U.S. Highway 278. For initial purposes, only the portion of Marietta Highway from the Cobb County line to the intersection with Highway 278 was included in the Corridor Overlay Zone. Marietta Highway is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated Future Land Use Map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors. Future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County. With this amendment, the remaining portion of State Route 120, traversing to the west from U.S. 278 through to the Haralson County line shall be included as a transportation corridor in order to create continuity with the other portions of State Route 120.
(b)
Bill Carruth Parkway f/k/a West Hiram Parkway is located in the east-central portion of the county, west of the City of Hiram. The parkway begins at the intersection of Marietta Highway with U.S. Highway 278 and extends southward until it intersects with State Route 92 (Hiram-Douglasville Highway), South of Hiram. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. Bill Carruth Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(c)
In addition thereto, State Route 92 and State Route 61 traverse the county from Douglasville to Acworth and Villa Rica to Cartersville, respectively. Both state routes are heavily traveled and are the sites of varied new developments. The introduction of the corridor overlay district will encourage the development in this area to project a uniform, high-quality appearance.
(d)
U.S. Highway 278 is the most heavily traveled roadway in Paulding County, and is one of only two four-lane highways in the county. It traverses the county from Powder Springs in Cobb County to Rockmart in Polk County. U.S. 278 travels through the county's current commercial center, Hiram. As U.S. 278 is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated future land use map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors, future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County.
(e)
The East Hiram Parkway is a proposed highway corridor which will begin at the terminus of the Bill Carruth Parkway and continue through the eastern portion of Paulding County. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. East Hiram Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(f)
In addition thereto, all state routes in the county are designated as commercial areas in the future land use map and comprehensive plan. Paulding County does not have interstate access and therefore, the state routes remain the only other viable commercial corridors. Thus, it is important that these areas develop in a consistent manner to ensure the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor.
(g)
In recent years, Ridge Road has emerged as a mixed use corridor in the new Georgia area with commercial and residential developments throughout the length of the thruway. Ridge Road extends from State Route 92 to State Route 61. As Ridge Road continues to develop, it will be important to ensure continuity with design, quality, workmanship and materials in order to complete a visually pleasing development area.
(h)
Finally, the airport access road will serve as the gateway to the newly constructed Paulding County General Aviation Airport.

(b)
Primary landscaping materials used in the greenbelt and adjacent to buildings shall consist of one or a combination of the following: shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, ground covers, grass, mulches, etc.
(c)
The primary landscaping materials used in and around private parking areas shall be trees, which provide shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges, and other planting material may be used to compliment tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping.
(d)
All shade trees proposed to be used in accordance with any landscaping plan shall be a minimum of eight feet in overall height and have a minimum trunk diameter, 12 inches above the ground of two inches upon planting. They should be of a variety which will attain an average mature spread greater than 20 feet. The types of trees shall be those specified in the buffer sections of the zoning ordinance—Article VI, section E, (4) Standards, (l).
(e)
Landscaping materials selected should be appropriate to local growing and climatic conditions. Wherever appropriate existing trees should be conserved and integrated into the landscaping plan. Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture, color and for its ultimate growth. Indigenous and other hardy plants that are harmonious to the design, and of good appearance shall be used.
(f)
The landscaping plan shall ensure that sight distances are not obstructed for drivers of motor vehicles.

4)
Landscaping installation and maintenance.
(a)
Installation. All landscaping required by the approved landscaping plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building certificate of occupancy permit if said permit is issued during a planting season, or within six months of the date an occupancy permit is issued during a nonplanting season. If not planted, a bond shall be required for plantings for a period of one year (12-months) from date of certificate of occupancy.
(b)
Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with the standards set by this ordinance and as indicated on the landscaping plan, which has been approved by the community development department. This is to include, but not limited to, replaced dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris.

The sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and shall be subject to review and approval by the community development staff as to size, location, design and materials during the plan review process.
4.15.8 - Parking requirements.
Efforts to break up large expanse of pavement are to be encouraged by the interspersing of appropriate planting areas wherever possible. The number of parking spaces required is established in article VII of this zoning ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land use. Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such exception (i.e., a reference such as "shared parking," Urban land institute). There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible to the building(s) and identification as reserved for use by handicapped individuals, and these spaces shall be of sufficient width to accommodate their needs. All parking standards shall comply with article vii of this zoning ordinance.
4.15.9 - Lighting requirements.
In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot proposed to be developed in the corridor overlay district, factors to be considered by the community development shall include but are not limited to:
1)
Safety provided by the lighting;
2)
Security provided by the lighting;
3)
Possible light spillage or glare onto adjoining properties or streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining properties is prohibited);
4)
Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility with the overall treatment of the property;
5)
Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use (maximum height of 30 feet); and.
6)
Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided.
4.15.10 - Access to individual sites.
The transportation corridors by their functional nature as primary thoroughfares, must have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location of access points within the overlay zones.
All roadways listed as transportation corridors represent major thoroughfares, which must be controlled as to the number of access points (curb cuts) permitted.
Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of the corridors primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads, will have to be built. Such roads shall be coordinated with those of continuous lots and designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout all corridors:
Access to proposed developments shall be provided per Georgia Department of Transportation and/or Paulding County Department of Transportation access management standards, policies, guidelines and regulations.
4.15.11 - Access to potential development sites.
Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development. Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by the community development department in association with the Paulding County Department of Transportation.
4.15.12 - Other standards.
1)
Outside storage prohibited. (Seasonal sales). No outside, unenclosed storage of refuse (whether or not in containers) or display of merchandise shall be permitted on any lot. All refuse shall be contained completely within the principle or accessory building(s). Exceptions to this requirement will be made on a case-by-case basis by the board of zoning appeals using the variance procedure outlined in article XV. Seasonal sales are allowed four times a year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30-days. Outdoor sales (if allowed by the underlying zoning district) must be covered. Examples of coverings include but are not limited to tents and awnings.
2)
Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirements shall be as specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by landscaping or other screening.
3)
Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted within the corridor overlay district, except that any detached accessory building on any lot shall be designed to be architecturally designed and constructed with the same material as the principle building as to be compatible with the principle building which it is associated. All accessory buildings shall have a roof.
4)
Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a hard surface such as asphalt, concrete or other materials approved by the community development department.
5)
All utilities including but not limited to electric, cable, and phone services shall be underground unless otherwise approved by the community development department after written submittal providing justification for overhead utility services.
6)
Temporary or seasonal sales. Temporary or seasonal sales are allowed along the highway corridor on a case-by-case basis for a maximum of four times per year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30 days. Request for temporary or seasonal sales shall be made in writing accompanied by a recorded plat of the site and written permission from the property owners to the director of community development. A Paulding County Business License is required of all approved temporary or seasonal sales.
