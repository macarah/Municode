Footnotes:
--- (29) ---
Note— Adopted by the Board of Commissioners on September 1, 2004 (effective for petitions filed after November 1, 2004).

28.1. - General amendments.
Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice justify such action, and after consideration by the Community Zoning Board, the Board of Commissioners may, by resolution, change the regulations set forth in this Zoning Resolution (text amendment) or amend the Zoning Maps.
In amending the Zoning Maps, the Board of Commissioners may approve a use permit and/or zoning district applied for by the applicant or a more restrictive zoning district based on the ranking of Fulton County Zoning District intensities. The Board of Commissioners may consider a variance filed concurrently with a request for a rezoning and/or use permit.
In approving any zoning district change and/or use permit, the Board of Commissioners shall impose conditions of approval as deemed necessary and appropriate to mitigate potentially adverse influences or otherwise promote the public health, safety or general welfare.
Rezoning and/or use permit requests are referred to in this text as land use petitions. Changes made to standards contained within the zoning resolution are referred to in this article as text amendments. All land use petitions approved by the board of commissioners are subject to conditions approved by the board of commissioners.

The measurement should be from the source to the nearest points on the site where structures having noise sensitive uses are located. These points shall be labeled as the NAL (noise assessment locations). The measurement location for structures is a point 6.5 feet from the facade. In the event that the location of the structures has not yet been specified at the time of the noise study, then the distance used in the noise study should be measured as 6.5 feet less than the distance from the structure setback line to the major source(s) of noise. (Reference: Title 24, Housing & Urban Development, Part 51 — Environmental Criteria and Standards, Subpart B — Noise Abatement and Control, Section 51.103) Criteria and Standards (c) Exterior standards.
28.4.7. Public participation plan and report. The Public Participation Plan is to ensure that applicants pursue early and effective public participation in conjunction with their petitions, ensure that the citizens of Fulton County have an adequate opportunity to learn about petitions that may affect them, and to ensure ongoing communication between applicants, adjoining property owners, environmentally stressed communities, community associations and other organizations, elected officials and county staff. A target area for public participation should be determined by the applicant and current planner at the time of the pre-application review. Applicants are required to submit a Public Participation Plan for meeting with interested citizens to advise of pending rezoning/use permit applications and to allow citizens the opportunity to discuss concerns and provide input about project design or development. An applicant's responsibilities are to inform the public, solicit input, and provide a summary of these activities in the form of a written report (Public Participation Report).
The requirement for a Public Participation Plan does not give communities decision making powers or force a consensus on issues. Applicants are not obligated to make any concessions or changes based upon input from citizens. A refusal by the community to meet with applicants does not mean that the applicants fail to meet the requirements of the Public Participation Plan.
Dialogue should occur between applicants and communities before the Community Zoning Board hearing, the first public hearing. Public Participation Plans are required with all rezoning and/or use permit applications and must be filed simultaneously with the application. Participation Plan Reports are required to be submitted no less than seven business days before the scheduled Board of Commissioners' hearing. If the report is not submitted as required, the Board of Commissioners may defer an application.
The minimum requirements for public participation plans and public participation reports are as follows:
A.
Public participation plan. Every application for a rezoning or use permit which requires a public hearing shall include a public participation plan which must be implemented prior to the first public hearing.
Minimum standards:
