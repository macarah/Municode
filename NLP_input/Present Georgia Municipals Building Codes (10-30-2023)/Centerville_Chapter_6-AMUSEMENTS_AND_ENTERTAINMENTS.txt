Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability.

Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal.

(7)
The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court.

ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS[3]

Footnotes:

State Law reference— Authority of cities and counties to restrict adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to certain areas, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3.

Sec. 6-79. - Purpose.
(a)
Based on the demonstrated experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Macon and Bibb County, Georgia; Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Beaumont, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas, which experience is found to be relevant to the problems that face Centerville, Georgia, and regarding the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country, particularly the problems of crime, blight and deterioration which are brought about by the combination of alcohol and live nudity, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity, either partial or total, in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" in conjunction with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, whether sold on the premises or not, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking.
(b)
The city, therefore, finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the city finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment which will not be allowed to sell or serve alcoholic beverages or permit the consumption on the premises. The city finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interest, such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions, and that such regulations will not unduly infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
