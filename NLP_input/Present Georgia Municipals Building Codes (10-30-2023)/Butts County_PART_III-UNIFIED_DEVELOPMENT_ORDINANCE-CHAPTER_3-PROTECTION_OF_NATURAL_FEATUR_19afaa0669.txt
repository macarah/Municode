Sec. 3.02.01. - Generally.
Overlay districts are a special purpose zoning classification used to supplement, not substitute for, the current zoning districts, called the "underlying district," in order to protect and promote public and private investment. More stringent controls generally apply within the overlay districts than would normally be required in the underlying districts.
