Example: Restaurant with 100 seats open 12 hours a day next to a recreational facility.
(100) ร (15) ร 12 / 12 ร (1.0) = 1,500 gal. capacity
b.
Hospitals, nursing homes, schools and other commercial kitchens with varied seating capacity:
(M) ร (GM) ร (LF) ร (SC) } = Grease interceptor capacity in gallons / 1500
M = Meals per day
GM = Gallons of wastewater per seat (use 5 gallons per meal)
LF = Loading factor:
1.0 with dishwashing
0.5 without dishwashing
SC = storage capacity factor:
1.0 for Public sewer
2.5 for on-site septic disposal
Example: School facility w/252 cafeteria seat capacity

(267) ร (5) ร (2.5) ร (1.0) = 3,338 / 1,500 = 2.2
(2) 1,500 grease interceptors needed
Grocery stores will have a minimum (1) 1,500 grease trap. If additional eating facilities will be located in store similar to a food court area, store will be sized based on square footage of food area and seating capacity. Individual restaurants may be required to install pretreatment for their space.
(3)
Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be:
a.
Inadequate for the facility's current operation.
b.
In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals an upgrade or repair is required.
c.
Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the city or clean-up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair.
d.
Installed incorrectly and not per plumbing code used by the city or engineering standards. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced.
(4)
Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system. The concrete lid of tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled.
(5)
Any 3,000-gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two sections provided the center section has been sealed properly where no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be 3,000 gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All 3,000-gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or its equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two sections on tanks less than 1,500 gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as a baffle wall. A three-inch to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two feet from the bottom of the tank.
(6)
A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system.
(7)
Subsurface pretreatment systems installed must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification (or certification approved by the public works department) and the gallon (GMP) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify type and size of tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed.
(8)
All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two feet. The brick work will be three feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once 80 percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, you must corbel in the brickwork in small increments.
(9)
An alternative interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the city. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the city for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required.
(10)
A grease trap is used for the collection of kitchen waste discharge only. No can wash areas, no dumpster, no mop sinks, no food grinders and no floor drains in mechanical rooms, bathrooms, or discharge from food coolers. Commercial waste generators that have micro-brewery facilities may be subject to additional discharge requirements.
(11)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable pretreatment system.
(12)
It shall constitute a violation of this article to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the city sewer lines. If a commercial waste generator uses enzymes and bacteria for pretreatment maintenance and it is discovered that said substances causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of the sewer system, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential health hazard, then these additives will be prohibited. Use of any other substances, including special enzymes and bacteria is solely at the discretion of the commercial waste generator.
(13)
Grit, sand traps and oil water separators shall be installed in accordance with the current official plumbing code used by the city engineering standards.
(14)
Any strip retail shopping center or office building showing subsurface pretreatment systems at designated buildings or structures will only be allowed discharge by a single tenant or food service to that system. No multiple users will be allowed. The only exception to this condition is a shopping mall with a food court where pretreatment systems are installed and maintained by the mall corporation or management leasing.
