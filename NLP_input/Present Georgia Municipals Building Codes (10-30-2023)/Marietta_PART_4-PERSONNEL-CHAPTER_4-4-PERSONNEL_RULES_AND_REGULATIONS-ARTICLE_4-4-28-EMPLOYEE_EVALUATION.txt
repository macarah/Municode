4-4-28-010 - Purpose.
Performance evaluation is considered a key element in the management of human resources. It is the process of identifying and communicating organizational requirements, then measuring and developing the employee's performance. The primary purpose of performance evaluation is to provide an opportunity for feedback. Performance evaluations may be used to facilitate management decisions regarding compensation, training and development. It is of the utmost importance that the performance evaluation system be consistent, job related, and based on clear and objective criteria.
1.
A performance evaluation system should be formalized, standardized, objective and not biased against race, color, sex, religion, or national origin.
2.
Performance measurements must be job-related and based on critical elements specific to the job.
3.
Evaluators mast be trained and have substantial daily contact with the employee evaluated.
4.
Administration and scoring of the performance evaluation must be standardized and controlled.
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 13)
4-4-28-020 - Types of evaluations.
1.
Annual Evaluations. Pursuant to Section 2-2-24-120, employees will be evaluated annually on the anniversary of their most recent hire date for purposes of determining eligibility for merit increases. If the employee receives a rating of satisfactory or higher on their last annual evaluation they will be eligible to receive any council approved merit increase. Merit increases do not apply to part-time employees, appointed employees, employees in the apprentice line worker and line work program, interns or contractual employees.
2.
Working Test Period Evaluations. Employees are placed in a working test status upon hire by the city/BLW and when promoted, demoted or transferred. A working test period evaluation must be completed at the end of the employee's working test period indicating successful completion of that process. If an employee's working test period is extended, an additional evaluation will be completed prior to the employee being assigned regular status.
3.
Other Evaluations. A performance evaluation may be performed when an employee's performance has substantially declined or in connection with a disciplinary action when approved in advance by the department head and human resources director.
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 13)
4-4-28-030 - Supervisory responsibilities.
An employee's supervisor is required to prepare an employee's evaluation then meet, review and discuss the evaluation with the employee. After the review, the employee should be asked to sign the evaluation to indicate that he has read and understood the evaluation and has had an opportunity to discuss any question he might have with his supervisor. The employee's signature does not necessarily mean he agrees with the evaluation, just that he has had the opportunity to meet and discuss the evaluation with his supervisor.
Failure to complete an employee's evaluation timely or failure to responsibly communicate the contents of an evaluation to employees will result in lower evaluation scores on the supervisor's annual evaluation.
