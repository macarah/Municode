ARTICLE II. - ALARM SYSTEMS

Sec. 16-19. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the responsibilities of those persons who purchase, rent or use alarm systems, devices or services. This article is also intended to encourage the improvement in reliability of these systems, devices and services and to ensure that police and fire department personnel will not be unduly diverted from responding to actual criminal activity as a result of responding to false alarms. This article specifically encompasses "fire alarms," "burglar alarms," "robbery alarms," "holdup alarms," "medical alarms" and "panic alarms," both audible and inaudible (silent). The provisions of this article shall not apply to alarm systems which are owned or maintained by the city and installed on premises in which the city has a property interest.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alarm means and includes any fire, robbery, burglary, holdup, medical or panic alarm that transmits any signal (audible, visual or silent) to the city, indicating a predetermined emergency condition exists, whether the alarm is received either:
(1)
By telephone line to a designated position on an alarm panel;
(2)
By a private alarm service company relayed to the city communications center telephone;
(3)
By an automated telephone alarm system, playing a recorded message when received on the city communications center telephone; or
(4)
By a signal relayed to the city communications center by a third party.
False alarm means any activation of an alarm system where none of the emergencies for which the alarm system has been installed have in fact occurred.
Response means the dispatch of any police or fire unit to the premises where an alarm has been activated or the arrival of an officer to the location by any means of notification.
Telephone alarm system means any alarm system which automatically transmits by telephone line a recorded electronic or mechanical signal to a telephone instrument at the city communications center.
