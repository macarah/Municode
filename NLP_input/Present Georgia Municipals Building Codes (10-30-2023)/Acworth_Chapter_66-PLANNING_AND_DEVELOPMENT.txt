Sec. 66-171. - Undue hardship.
Where by reason of unusual circumstances the strict application of any provision of this article would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purposes of this article. An undue hardship shall be a situation not of the person's making, and shall consist of a problem unique to a specific property, or result in, if the terms of this article are complied with, noncompliance with one or more other ordinances of the city.
