(b)
To accomplish the foregoing purposes, there is hereby created a fire code board of appeals ("FCBA") consisting of five members appointed by the county board of commissioners. Each member of the board of commissioners shall have one appointee to the FCBA. To ensure balance on the FCBA, each member must have experience as an architect, fire protection engineer, builder, property manager, or construction superintendent, or such other experience as may be useful to consideration of these issues. No county employee can serve as a member of the FCBA. No member of the FCBA can hear an appeal in which that member has any personal, professional or financial interest. Members of the FCBA shall serve with or without compensation, as determined by the board of commissioners.
(c)
The FCBA shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions, or determinations made by the fire chief, or his/her designee, relative to the suitability of alternate materials and types of construction and to provide for reasonable interpretations of the code, regulations, and rules adopted by the county. The FCBA shall not have the authority to amend such code, regulations, or rules; neither does the FCBA have the authority to correct what it may consider to be an unwise requirement. The powers and duties of the FCBA are limited to quasi-judicial and administrative matters as set forth in this chapter. In making any interpretation of the code, regulations, and rules, or granting any equivalency, the FCBA shall make the following findings:
(1)
That the interpretation or equivalency is consistent with the purpose of this chapter and not in violation with any other applicable state or federal law;
(2)
That the interpretation or equivalency will not lessen the protection to the people of the county and property situated therein.
(d)
The terms of office of the members of the FCBA shall run concurrently with the term of the member of the board of commissioners who appointed that particular member. In any event, a term shall not exceed four years in the absence of reappointment.
(e)
Members of the FCBA may be removed at any time by the appointing member of the board of commissioners for cause or for no cause. Members whose terms have expired should continue to serve as members until their successors have been appointed.
(f)
In conducting its business, the FCBA shall comply with the following procedures:
(1)
Meetings of the FCBA shall be held at the call of the chair of the FCBA, provided that due notice shall first be given. The chair of the FCBA, or in his/her absence the acting vice-chair of the FCBA, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the FCBA shall be open to the public. The FCBA shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the county clerk and shall be a public record.
(2)
Three members of the FCBA shall constitute a quorum. The vote of three FCBA members is necessary to render any decision or take any action.
(3)
The FCBA shall elect a chair and vice-chair to serve for a period of one year, with such one-year period to run per calendar year.
(4)
The FCBA shall make and enforce such rules, regulations, and bylaws for the government of itself, the preservation of order, and the transaction of its business as may be necessary. Rules, regulations, and bylaws adopted by the FCBA shall not take effect until they are submitted to and approved by the county board of commissioners.
(g)
In deciding appeals, the FCBA shall comply with the following procedures:
(1)
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the fire chief, or his/her designee, made in the course of the administration or enforcement of the code, regulations, and rules may appeal to the FCBA by filing a request in writing with the fire marshal, and by paying a fee in an amount to be approved by the board of commissioners, provided such appeal is made within 30 days from the date the decision is rendered by the fire chief, or his/her designee.
(2)
Upon receipt of the application and required fee, the fire marshal shall transmit to the FCBA all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(3)
The FCBA shall review the application at a public hearing. The purpose of the public hearing is to enable the FCBA to obtain facts surrounding the case which may not be evident, or which may not be shown in the record as submitted to the FCBA. The decision of the FCBA shall be based upon the facts and not upon expressions of support or protest, or lack of support or protest, which may be made at the hearing. Any party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or by attorney.
(4)
The FCBA, subject to the provisions and restraints of this chapter, may condition any grant of approval upon the fulfillment of other reasonable conditions or requirements, and may attach a time period during which its grant of approval must be exercised, or expire.
(5)
The FCBA shall render a decision and findings in writing to the fire chief, with a duplicate copy to the petitioner within 14 days of the public hearing. Decisions and findings in writing shall include signatures of a quorum of FCBA members. Failure of the FCBA to render a decision and findings in writing within 14 days of the public hearing shall constitute approval of the fire chief, or his/her designee's, original decision.
(h)
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the FCBA may petition the county board of commissioners for review to determine whether the FCBA's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. The petition is barred unless it is filed within 30 days of the date the FCBA adopts its written decision and findings. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be final.

( Ord. No. 2021-O-013 , § 1, 9-7-21)
Sec. 28-111. - Safeguards and limitations for outdoor burning; permit required.
No person shall start or maintain any outdoor burning listed in this section without first obtaining a permit issued by Cherokee County Fire Marshal's Office. Permits may be revoked or withheld by the fire marshal for just cause.
(a)
Bonfire. Burn permit required. A bonfire shall not be located within a minimum of 50 feet of a structure or other combustible material, and shall be a minimum of 100 feet from property lines. The bonfire may not include any brush, leaves, straw or treated lumber. There shall be a 50-foot clear area around the fire area, clear of combustible materials, debris or material that could cause fire to spread. Distances may be increased by the fire marshal depending on the size of the bonfire. Bonfires shall be a maximum of 12 feet in each length, width, and height. The permit will be valid for specified dates and times.
(b)
Open burning for purposes of land clearing. Burn permit(s) required. The following conditions shall govern open burning for the purposes of land clearing. The company, contractor, and/or landowner in control of the property is responsible for compliance with the requirements of this article and the rules established by GA EPD. Permits may be revoked at any time by the issuing agency or its representing agency if conditions or permit restrictions require such.
(1)
Open burning for the purpose of land clearing is permitted from October 1 through April 30.
(2)
An air curtain destructor (ACD), which is constructed, installed, and operating in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions of fly ash and smoke, is required for open burning in a pit for the purposes of land clearing.
(3)
After the pit/site is prepared, the owner shall schedule an inspection with the Fire Marshal's Office (FMO) and obtain an ACD permit prior to any burning. The permit will be valid for specified dates, with a maximum of 30 days.
(4)
The location of the ACD pit shall be at least 300 feet from any occupied structure or public road. An ACD used solely for utility clearing or road clearing may be located at a lesser distance upon approval of the fire marshal.
(5)
No more than one air curtain destructor shall be operated within a ten-acre area at one time, unless there is a minimum of 1,000 feet between any two air curtain destructors.
(6)
A pit shall be excavated to the following dimensions: 8 feet wide × 12—15 feet deep × 15—30 feet long (the length is dependent upon the length of the ACD manifold). In no case shall the eight-foot width be exceeded. The pit must be excavated so as to have at least three vertical sides in soil capable of maintaining vertical walls 15 feet in depth without failure. Walls shall not be undercut during excavation. If a front-end loader is used for the excavation, the end of the pit used for ingress and egress, as well as the ramp, shall be filled with dirt prior to the start of the burn. Any accumulation of water in the pit shall be removed prior to loading the pit.
(7)
The manifold shall be placed and properly supported on a berm of soil (one to one and one-half feet high), and the space between the manifold and ground shall be sealed. The manifold shall be positioned to direct the air curtain at an imaginary line 24 and 36 inches below the top of the opposite wall.
(8)
A "stop guide" or restraint shall be provided at the loading site of the pit to keep the loader from getting too close to the pit during operation. If spalling or "cave off" of the pit walls occurs during operation, a new pit shall be constructed and the existing pit filled with soil.
(9)
Burning shall occur in the pit, with the pit initially being loaded half full. Only wood waste consisting of trees, logs, large brush and stumps which are relatively free of soil shall be burned. Leaves, sawdust, other densely packed wood wastes, paper, and chemically treated, coated, or impregnated wood shall not be burned.
(10)
In igniting the wood, up to one-half gallon of fuel oil may be utilized. Tires or other rubber products, plastic, heavy oils, highly volatile solvents such as mineral spirits or gasoline, and asphaltic-based or impregnated materials shall not be used for ignition or to maintain the operation of the air curtain destructor.
(11)
The fire must be at full intensity prior to intermittent charging. With respect to intermittent charging, the pit shall not be overloaded, so as to not protrude above the air curtain.
(12)
Ash shall be removed to maintain efficient and proper combustion, and shall not be allowed to build up in the pit to higher than one-third of the pit's depth or to the point that ash impedes combustion and is blown out of the pit, whichever occurs first.
(13)
The cleaning out of the air curtain destructor pit shall be performed in a manner to prevent fugitive ash and or dust.
(14)
The air curtain destructor shall not be fired before 10:00 a.m. and the fire must be completely extinguished, using water, covering with dirt or using another acceptable method, at least one hour before sunset. All fires are to be completely extinguished by the specified time unless special conditions exist and prior authorization has been granted. It is the responsibility of the party requesting the permit to notify the issuing agency of the special conditions when the permit is being issued.
(15)
No open burning for the purposes of land clearing is allowed at night, on weekends, or on holidays.
(16)
No open burning will be authorized when weather conditions (wind, humidity, temperature, mixing level, overcast, etc.) may jeopardize the safety of life and property as determined by the Fire Marshal's Office based on the daily weather forecast obtained from the state forestry commission or other weather forecasting resource.
( Ord. No. 2021-O-013 , § 1, 9-7-21)
Sec. 28-112. - Enforcement.
The following procedures shall be followed during enforcement actions. The fire marshal shall be responsible for enforcement of this article. The county marshal or his or her designee shall be authorized to issue a citation returnable to the magistrate's court for violation.
Any person who violates any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a violation of such ordinance and shall be punished in accordance with section 1-12 and as it may be amended from time to time.
