ARTICLE V. - FINANCIAL AND PURCHASING POLICY
DIVISION 1. - FINANCIAL POLICY

Sec. 2-241. - Purpose and objective.
Butts County seeks to establish a framework of policies which will further the direction and limits within which the county is to fulfill its fiscal financial responsibilities. Sound financial policies are necessary to carry out these objectives responsibly and efficiently.
If effectively used, the county's budget serves as the primary tool in allocating financial resources to programs and services. Specifically, the budget can serve as a policymaking tool, a management tool, a financial tool, and a communication tool.
The process is complex because unlike private businesses, Butts County has a broader range of responsibilities. The board of commissioners is expected to address the community's social issues, protect the citizens' interests, provide public safety and enforce laws and regulations. For accountability purposes, the board of commissioners operates transparently. Decisions are made in an open public forum and the board of commissioners is accountable to its citizens, while pursuing goals of efficiency and effectiveness.
Butts County's financial policies, set forth below, are the basic framework for its overall financial management. These policies will incorporate principles and traditions that will serve the county well in maintaining a sound and stable financial condition.
The broad purpose of the following financial policies is to enable Butts County to achieve and maintain a long-term positive financial condition through the following goals:
(1)
Ensure Butts County maintains a financial base sufficient to provide a consistent level of county services.
(2)
Maintain best practices that meet all applicable standards and direct Butts County's financial resources toward meeting the goals of the county's strategic plan.
(3)
Keep Butts County in a fiscally sound position in both the long and short term.
(4)
Maintain sufficient financial liquidity to meet normal operating and contingency obligations.
(5)
Maintain and preserve existing infrastructure and capital assets.
(6)
Guide the board and management policy decisions that have significant financial impact.
(7)
Ensure Butts County is able to withstand local and regional economic variations and adjust to changes in the service requirements of the community.
(8)
Set forth operating principles that minimize the cost of government and financial risks.
(9)
Promote sound financial management by providing accurate and timely information on Butts County's financial condition.
(10)
Provide a framework for the wise and prudent use of debt financing and maintain a good credit rating in the financial community while assuring taxpayers that the county government is financially well-managed and operated in a sound fiscal condition.
(11)
Ensure the legal use of financial resources through effective systems of internal controls.
(12)
Promote cooperation and coordination with other governmental entities and the private sector in financing and delivery of services.
(13)
Improve productivity and eliminate duplication of county functions through assessment of programs and operations.
(14)
Require service users to pay their fair share of program costs as approved by the board of commissioners.
The key values of Butts County's financial management include fiscal integrity, prudence, planning, accountability, honesty and transparency. Specifically, it is the board of commissioner's intent to maximize the level of public goods and services.
Because of the broad and diverse nature of Butts County's numerous departments, having written, clearly defined financial policies minimizes the risk of developing conflicting or inconsistent goals and objectives which could have a negative impact on the overall financial position of Butts County.
This financial policy statement includes subsections on budget format, reserves, revenues, expenditures, capital expenditures, debt, finance and accounting and investments.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-242. - Budget format.
The main feature in the development of a budget format is to make the budget document readable and understandable to the general public and county officials. The budget must be developed in a format that will also provide sufficient detail in financial information to guide the departments and assist the board of commissioners and finance staff in program evaluation and monitoring.
A budget calendar for the subsequent budget year shall be presented to the board of commissioners prior to February 15th of each year. The calendar shall include specific tasks required to prepare the budget and completion dates for those tasks. (See division 2, Purchasing Policy.)
Butts County utilizes a decentralized operating budget process. All departments and constitutional officers provide to the finance department requests for personnel, goods, capital, and services necessary to meet the operational objectives of the budget period. Each shall submit a budget for current level of service.
The budget for each fund must be balanced. Anticipated revenues and unreserved fund balance must equal or exceed anticipated expenditures.
Budgets for governmental fund types will be adopted on a basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Revenues are budgeted when they become measurable and available and expenditures are charged against the budget when they become measurable, where a liability has been incurred, and the liability will be liquidated with current resources.
The county manager shall maintain a system of budgetary control to ensure adherence to the budget and the chief financial officer shall prepare timely financial reports to compare actual and budget amounts. These reports shall be distributed to department directors on a monthly basis.
The proposed budget shall be submitted to the board of commissioners for adoption prior to the end of the fiscal year for the subsequent year. A copy of the proposed budget shall be made available to the public and, upon request, to the news media. An advertisement of the availability of the proposed budget and notice of a public hearing shall be placed as prescribed in O.C.G.A. ยง 36-81-5. The public hearing shall be at least one week prior to the meeting at which the budget is to be adopted by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-243. - Reserve policies.
The general fund is required to maintain a fund reserve of at least four months of the total budgeted appropriation. This policy demonstrates Butts County's commitment to maintain a high standard of fiscal responsibility.
This reserve is to pay for Butts County's essential service programs and funding requirements during period of economic downturn, to provide for non-recurring unanticipated expenditures, or to cover known contingencies with unknown costs. Use of reserves must be approved by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-244. - Revenue policies.
The board of commissioners levies property taxes, assesses the one percent local option sales tax and one percent special purpose local option sales tax, and imposes impact fees on new construction. In addition, the board of commissioners assesses user charges for other services provided by Butts County. The following policies provide guidance regarding county revenues:
(1)
Property tax rates shall be maintained at a rate adequate to fund an adequate and basic service level. Based upon taxable levels, rates will be adjusted to fund this service level.
(2)
Butts County will maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to shelter it from short-run fluctuations in any single revenue source and to reduce its dependence upon property taxes.
(3)
The county manager and chief financial officer will estimate its annual revenues by an objective, analytical and conservative process utilizing trend, judgmental, and statistical analysis as appropriate.
(4)
Users fees will be adjusted as needed, but not less than every five years, to recover the full cost of services provided, except when the board of commissioners determines that a subsidy from the general fund is in the public interest.
(5)
One-time revenues will be used for one-time expenditures only.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-245. - Expenditure policies.
(a)
High priority will be given to expenditures that will reduce future operating costs, such as increased utilization of technology, equipment and prudent business methods.
(b)
Before the board of commissioners undertakes any agreement that would create significant fixed ongoing expenses, the cost implications of such agreement would be fully determined for current and future years with the aid of strategic financial planning models.
(c)
All externally mandated services for which full or partial funding is available will be fully costed out to allow for reimbursement of expenses. The estimated direct costs of service will be budgeted and charged to the fund performing the service. Interfund service fees charged to recover these direct costs will be recognized as revenue to the providing fund.
(d)
The budget shall balance recurring operating expenses to recurring operating revenue.
(e)
Expenditures will be controlled and will stay with the amount of appropriated funds.
(f)
The board of commissioners will attempt to maintain its present service level for mandated services within existing revenues. There will be no new services without an appropriate trade-off of services, financial impact and/or fees.

Sec. 2-302. - Purchasing responsibilities.
It is imperative that the county continually strive to balance cost, delivery, and quality in every area of the county's operations. It is mandatory that the responsibilities for buying materials and services be assigned to a group of people skilled in negotiating, value analysis, and other purchasing techniques.
To achieve this overall objective, the responsibilities, authorities, and controls set forth in this procedure, and related policies, must be adhered to by all county employees.
The following are the basic responsibilities of the purchasing unit (hereinafter "purchasing"):
Only those persons to whom authority has specifically been delegated by the board of commissioners are authorized to commit county funds for materials, equipment, supplies, and services, except that such delegation of authority shall not apply to or be required of those employees or agents of the Butts County sheriff, as the sheriff is empowered by law with decision-making authority to commit funds for the purchase of materials, equipment, supplies, or services following approval of its fiscal budget.
The chief financial officer has the responsibility for the procurement of all goods and services, and to either provide the services for such procurement or give functional directions to others delegated the authority to perform such service.
Purchasing has the authority to obligate the county for purchases and for making the final determination of sources of supply, quantities purchased, delivery schedules, and price negotiations for all purchases under $20,000.00 or where others are so authorized by the chief financial officer. Notwithstanding the above, in the event a contract must be executed, such contract shall be tendered to the board of commissioners for approval and recordation on the minutes. The board of commissioners will make the final decision for purchases over $20,000.00, unless purchased under State of Georgia purchasing contracts, or unless purchased by the Butts County sheriff following approval of its fiscal budget.
Purchasing is responsible for initiating and maintaining effective, professional relationships with suppliers.
Purchasing is to serve as the exclusive channel through which all requests regarding prices and products are handled. The purchasing unit will generate all correspondence with suppliers involving prices or quotations. In cases where technical details are necessary, the using department may correspond directly with suppliers regarding technical issues, so long as purchasing is apprised of those communications.
All negotiations are to be handled by the appropriate purchasing personnel within their delegated authority.
When supplier sales representatives make personal sales calls, they are to be directed to call on the appropriate employee in purchasing responsible for purchasing the materials or services being offered.
All employees involved in purchasing activities will work to maintain and enhance the county's image by their personal conduct and methods of doing business.
All employees engaged in purchasing activities will recognize and practice good public relations by giving all callers and visitors courteous treatment.
Purchasing personnel are to seek to obtain and purchase all goods at the lowest possible total end- user cost, considering the guidelines of prices, service, quality, and delivery.
Purchasing personnel are to inform ordering departments whenever the quantity or specifications of materials ordered are inconsistent with sound purchasing practices or market conditions.
Purchasing personnel will negotiate the return of rejected equipment or supplies to suppliers.
Procurement awards for off-the-shelf equipment and/or standard commodities where the dollar amount is equal to or less than the approved budget do not require board of commissioner approval, regardless of dollar value, if the following criteria have been met:
(1)
The proposed award was competitively bid;
(2)
The responsible, responsive low bidder was selected;
(3)
The user department agrees with the recommendation in writing.
If the award for an off-the-shelf item or standard commodity exceeds the approved budget and the bid amount exceeds a total of $20,000.00, the board of commissioners must approve the procurement prior to award, unless the item or commodity is being purchased by the Butts County sheriff following approval of its fiscal budget. The department head will identify to the finance department where the additional funds will come from and, upon approval by the board of commissioners, will coordinate with finance on the transfer of funds.
The board of commissioners must approve all awards for construction and services if the award amount exceeds $20,000.00, except those awards for construction and services sought or secured by the Butts County sheriff following approval of the its fiscal budget. Notwithstanding the entitlement of the Butts County sheriff to spend budgeted funds without board of commissioner approval, the Butts County sheriff remains subject to the dictates of state and federal law with respect to purchasing, including the obligation of competitive bidding where required by law.
Purchasing is responsible for establishing contracts for annual requirements for consumables e.g. office supplies and service contracts for items such as janitorial services, HVAC maintenance, etc. These types of contracts will be competed and can be renewed for two additional years, subject to performance and contractor cost increases staying within the Consumer Price Index. Departments are required to use these contracts and purchasing will notify all users if the contractor is changed.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-303. - Formal purchasing process.
When feasible, all requests for items will be submitted to purchasing via email; all backups for the request should be forwarded to purchasing at the time requisition is entered. Approvals shall be in accordance with process described below. If the request is for a public work, road project or any other material or service for which advertising is necessary, the request will be submitted to purchasing no later than 12:00 noon on Thursday for submittal to the newspaper by 12:00 noon on Monday. The publication of the advertisement and content thereof shall conform to applicable provisions of Georgia law and shall be submitted by the chief financial officer. A bid package will be developed by purchasing which can be obtained by interested parties. Once an approved requisition and appropriate back up (including detailed specifications and plans if required) is received the purchasing staff will use the following process:
(a)
Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases, the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of source selection and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
โข
Clear and adequate specifications are available;
โข
Two or more responsible, responsive bidders are willing to participate in the process; and
โข
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment or project is $20,000.00 or greater.
(1)
Purchases of $20,000.00 or more. Any commodity which is expected to cost $20,000.00 or more shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided herein.
(2)
Dissemination of invitations to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be advertised as required by Georgia law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item or services to be purchased shall state the location where bid documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement, identified as likely to result in optimal competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the chief financial officer.
(3)
Receipt of bids. No bid shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing unit on or before the date and time specified in the request for bids. The purchasing unit shall cause all bids to be stamped with the date and time of receipt and shall secure such bids until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the county. Late bids shall be returned unopened to the bidder.
(4)
Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for bids. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid and such other information as the chief financial officer deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information, bid tabulation, shall be recorded and available for public inspection. The bid information will be posted on the Butts County website and will also be available to bidders upon written request.
(5)
Modification of bids. Any clerical mistake which is patently obvious on the face of a bid may, subject to the limitations described below, be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the chief financial officer determines the correction to be in the county's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
a.
Price information and any required bonding
(6)
Withdrawal of bids. Bids may be withdrawn only by written request of the submitting party, at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following:
The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error, with said notice to be given within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and material used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the whole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if he elects to withdraw his bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
(7)
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the invitation.
(8)
Bid cancellation. An invitation for bid may be cancelled prior to opening date, or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the county in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing unit or; as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made a part of the bid file.
(9)
Bid responsiveness. In the event that only one bid is received in a competitive sealed bid process, the manager shall, as soon as practical, go out for bid again with the goal of receiving at least the minimum required two bids. If, following a rebid process, only one bid is received, the manager shall bring this to the board of commissioners for further direction or approval/rejection of the sole bid.
(b)
Bid award.
(1)
Responsive and responsible bidder(s). Subject to approval by the Butts County board of commissioners, except as otherwise specified herein, bids shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder(s) whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bid, will be most advantageous to the county, with price and other factors considered. A written award mailed (or otherwise furnished) to the successful bidder within the time for acceptance specified in the bid shall be deemed to result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(2)
Approval of bids. All bid awards for amounts of $20,000.00 or greater shall be approved or rejected by the Butts County board of commissioners, unless such bid awards are awarded under a Georgia state contract, unless such bid awards are for budgeted off-the-shelf equipment or standard commodities and the award price is within the budgeted amount and is awarded to the lowest responsible, responsive offer or with department concurrence, or unless such bid awards are for construction, materials, or services sought or secured by the Butts County sheriff following approval of its fiscal budget, as the sheriff is empowered by law with decision-making authority to authorize such expenditures so long as state and federal law is otherwise observed.
(3)
Rejection of bids. The county reserves the right to reject any or all bids if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the county.
(4)
Disqualification of bids. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award:
a.
A bid that is incomplete in any material aspect;
b.
A bid submitted without required bonds; and
c.
A bid submitted by a company that has been permanently removed from the bidders list for cause.
(5)
Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same (including business reputation, financial stability and work history), the bid shall be awarded to the Butts County bidder if only one of the bidders has its principal place of business in Butts County. If both or neither of the tied bidders has its principal place of business in Butts County, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by purchasing staff in a public session where bidders and one or more witnesses may be present.
(6)
Local vendor preference (OCBCGA part I, section 11.2). Butts County has established a local vendor privilege. Bids or proposals awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and will therefore be given special consideration when bidding against vendors out of local county jurisdiction. Bids or proposals received from local vendors will be given preference if such bid or proposal is responsive to bid requirements and within five percent of the low bid submitted by any out-of-county bidder. In such instance, the local vendor agrees to match the low bid offered by the out-of-county vendor. If the local vendor agrees to match the lowest bidder within a time specified by the county, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor.
A local vendor shall be eligible to receive the benefit of this privilege if it meets each of the following requirements prior to any award of a contract or purchase:
a.
The vendor must operate and maintain a regular place of business within geographical boundaries of Butts County; and
b.
The vendor must have a current occupational tax certificate; and
c.
The vendor must have paid all real and personal taxes owed the county; and
d.
The vendor must certify its compliance with the Georgia Security and Immigration Act.
This policy shall not apply to any bid or proposal for material, equipment or services in excess of $100,000.00. In such case, the local vendor privilege shall not apply.
(c)
Contract/purchase order awards over $20,000.00. The purchasing unit will submit to the board of commissioners a recommendation for accepting or rejecting a bid/proposal at the commissioners' meetings on the second Monday of each month unless an emergency exists. In such event, a letter will be submitted with the bid form describing the emergency. Budgeted items that were competitively bid, where the bids are within the budget, and the lower bidder is selected with department head approval are exempt from this requirement.
The chief financial officer and the appropriate department head prior to submittal will base the recommendation on a review. A written recommendation will be submitted along with the bid or proposal tabulation, list of bidders solicited, and justification for vendor selection (e.g. low bidder, best-qualified bidder/proposal, sole source justification, and any necessary back up).
Once a bid or proposal has been approved by the board of commissioners and recorded in the minutes of the meeting the purchasing staff will issue the appropriate documents to the selected bidder. Original documents and files will be kept in the purchasing unit.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-304. - Informal purchase orders.
Purchases that involve amounts less than $20,000.00 do not require a formal sealed bid process. However, the process used for any such purchase will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of procurement.
(a)
Informal purchases. Informal purchases (purchases which involve amounts less than $20,000.00) are classified below:
(1)
Purchases $0.00โ$20,000.00. Those that are required to be made through the purchasing unit. Except as otherwise specified herein, these purchases shall be handled through the purchasing unit unless otherwise delegated by the chief financial officer. The department is to complete a request via email to the purchasing unit identifying the goods and/or services.
(2)
If the amount of the purchase is not greater than $2,500.00, the purchasing staff will use its best judgment as to source, and number of pre-purchase estimates to obtain prior to making the purchase. If the amount is greater than $2,500.00 but not greater than $5,000.00, the buyer should obtain at least two verbal quotes (exceptions: proprietary, sole source, emergency or state contract), and otherwise comply with the directives in paragraph (o) of the policy section. If a proprietary, sole source or emergency purchase is made, then justification should be indicated in the email. The buyer will indicate the quotes received in the correspondence.
(3)
If the amount of the purchase is greater than $5,000.00 but not more than $20,000.00, the purchasing staff shall obtain written quotes from not less than three bidders quotes (exceptions: proprietary, sole source, emergency or state contract), and otherwise comply with the directives in paragraph (o) of the policy section. If a proprietary, sole source or emergency purchase is made then justification should be indicated in the email. The buyer will indicate the quotes received in the correspondence.
(4)
If the amount of the purchase is greater than $20,000.00, the purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through sealed written quotations (exceptions: proprietary, sole source, emergency, or state contract). If a proprietary or sole source purchase is made, then a letter, signed by the department director, should be attached stating the compelling and justifiable reasons for the lack of competition. Emergency purchases should be explained on the purchase requisition.
(5)
All original purchase order documentation (i.e. quotes, written specifications, plans, sole source, etc.) will be maintained in the purchasing unit.
(b)
Purchase requisitions. Requisitioners will complete a purchase requisition for all informal purchased items via email.
(1)
Requisitioner. The person requesting the goods and services.
(2)
Delivery address. The destination to which goods are to be shipped.
(3)
Quantity. Ordering quantity for each item.
(4)

(5)
Estimated unit cost account number. The budget line item account number to which the item will be charged.
(Note: It is the responsibility of the approving authority to verify that there is budget available). Vendors may be indicated if desired.
(6)
Commodity code. [It] is important that the correct commodity code is used for the purchase so that the requisition is forwarded to the correct party.
Once the requisition is entered, the authorized employee from the department making the purchase must approve the requisition on-line. Once approved, the requisition will go to the appropriate buyer as designated by the commodity code. Note: Requisitions, either through GEMS or manual, relating to computer equipment or software shall first be reviewed and approved by the I.T. department prior to being approved by purchasing; requisitions relating to vehicles and any other purchases over $15,000.00 will go to administration for approval prior to being approved by purchasing.
Purchases will not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for informal purchases and required approvals.
(Ord. of 7-13-2020(1))
Sec. 2-305. - Approval requirements for requisitions.
(a)
(1)
The appropriate individual must approve purchase requirements and bid forms.

(b)
It is the policy of this county to award contracts for professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications, at a fair and reasonable price, with the ultimate selection being based on the best interest of the county and receipt of maximum value.

The scope of work will include the selection criteria to be used. When the selection process for professional services is handled any way other than through sealed proposals or sealed bids, the BOC will authorize such process and procedures.
(e)
Such procedures shall permit as much competition as possible consistent with obtaining qualified persons and/or firms to perform necessary professional services. The selection process may vary from type to type of professional service or according to the purpose of the individual contract.

The user department shall also maintain documentation of such authorizations and procedures approved by the BOC.
(f)
For professional services selected through the process set forth above (i.e., using competitive sealed bids or request for proposals, being handled through purchasing), the user department(s) will be responsible for the service requirements and evaluation of the bids. Purchasing will ensure that the process is handled properly and that appropriate documentation is maintained. If the selection process is not handled through purchasing, the user department is responsible for ensuring that proper authorization, and approval of procedures utilized, has been obtained from the BOC. The user department is also responsible for following the procedures approved by the BOC and maintaining appropriate documentation. The selection process may be handled directly by the user department or by an outside firm acting as an agent for the county if that procedure is determined to be most advantageous to the county.

Sec. 2-315. - Reimbursement of expenditures with sales tax collected.
It is the policy of the Butts County board of commissioners to comply with the State of Georgia sales and use tax exemption, O.C.G.A. ยง 48-8-3(1) when reimbursing employees, constitutional officers and elected and appointed officials for personally paid expenditures. O.C.G.A. Chapter 8 of Title 48 provides a sales tax exemption for federal government, State of Georgia, or any county or municipality in Georgia. The board of commissioners strongly supports the stewardship role in securing taxpayer money by eliminating sales tax reimbursements. Butts County shall utilize the best practice to purchase supplies, materials and equipment with county sales tax exempt vendor accounts and process payments directly to the vendor through the finance department. In the event a county vendor account cannot be utilized, and sales tax is collected by the vendor, the reimbursement to the employee, constitutional officer and elected and appointed officials will exclude the sales tax charged.
