(2)
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated.
a.
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
b.
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
c.
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from those considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
d.
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.
e.
Upon promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard for a particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The city manager will notify all affected industrial users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
(3)
Local limits. The table on the following page identifies the conventional, organic, and inorganic daily average pollutant limits (as of the date of issuance of these regulations) established to protect against treatment plant process interference, stream standards violations, or sludge contamination. Discharges by users of the city's sewage collection and treatment system are limited such that the concentrations of specific pollutants measured at the point of discharge into the collection system do not exceed concentrations specified in the table.
The city may enter into special agreements with industrial dischargers whereby the city allows higher discharge concentrations above local limits as long as the maximum headworks loading to the treatment plant for any pollutant is not exceeded.
The city reserves the right to alter the pollutant limits specified in Table (b)(2) at any time and to add other pollutants as the city deems necessary. Current local and conventional pollutant limits will be on file in the office of the city's industrial pretreatment coordinator.

Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the city's sewage collection and treatment system, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city manager a report containing the information described in subsection (f)(1)b. of these regulations. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(6) of these regulations.
(4)
Periodic compliance reports.
a.
All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city manager but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(6) of these regulations.
b.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
c.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city manager, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (f)(11) of these regulations, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(5)
Reports of changed conditions.
a.
Each user must notify the city manager of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change.
b.
The city manager may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection (d)(5) of this section.
c.
The city manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection (d)(7) of this section or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection (e)(6) of this section in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
d.
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
Reports of potential problems.
a.
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause problems for the city's sewage collection and treatment system, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
b.
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the city's sewage collection and treatment system, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to these regulations.
c.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection a., above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(6)
Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city manager as the city manager may require.
(7)
Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
(8)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
a.
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the city manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the city's sewage collection and treatment system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the city's sewage collection and treatment system, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (f)(5) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsection (f) of these regulations.
b.
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection a., above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months, during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste, do not require additional notification.
c.
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste of listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
d.
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
e.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by these regulations, a permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(9)
Reserved.
(10)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(11)
Sample collection.
a.
Except as indicated in subsection b., below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the city manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
b.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, hexavalent chromium, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(12)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13)
Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of these regulations shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by these regulations and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager.
(g)
Compliance monitoring.
(1)
Right of entry: Inspection and sampling. The city manager shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of these regulations and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
Where a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city manager will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
The city manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
The city manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of these regulations.
(2)
Search warrants. If the city manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of these regulations, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with these regulations or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Cherokee County Superior Court.
(h)
Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city manager's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(i)
Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The city manager shall publish annually, in the largest newspaper of general circulation where the city is located, a list of the users that, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the city manager believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public, city personnel, or to the environment, or has resulted in the city manager's exercise of his emergency city to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violation(s) that the city manager determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(j)
Administrative enforcement remedies.
(1)
Notification of violation. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the city of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without a notice of violation first being issued.
(2)
Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a specified time period.
(3)
Show cause hearing. The city manager may order a user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice (administrative show cause order) shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(4)
Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an administrative compliance order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(5)
Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue a cease and desist order directing the user to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
a.
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
b.
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(6)
Administrative fines.
a.
When the City Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
b.
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
c.
Users desiring to dispute fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
d.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(7)
Emergency suspensions. The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the city's sewage collection and treatment system, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the city's sewage collection and treatment system, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (j)(8) of this section are initiated against the user.
A user responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (j)(3) or (j)(8) of these regulations.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(8)
Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in subsection (e)(6) of this section, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
a.
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
b.
Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics of the discharge;
c.
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
d.
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
e.
Violation of the pretreatment standards in subsection (b) of this section.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of his discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (j)(3) of these regulations why the proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the city manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(k)
Judicial enforcement remedies.
(1)
Injunctive relief. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may petition the Cherokee County Superior Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by these regulations on activities of the user. The City Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(2)
Civil penalties.
a.
A user violating, or continuing to violate, any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
b.
The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
c.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
d.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(3)
Criminal prosecution. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as provided in the City of Ball Ground Code.
a.
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the city's sewage collection and treatment system that causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided in the Cherokee County Code. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
b.
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to these regulations, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under these regulations shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided in the Cherokee County Code.
(4)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in these regulations are not exclusive. The city manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city manager may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant user.
(l)
Supplemental enforcement action.
(1)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of these regulations, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after he has satisfactorily demonstrated his ability to comply.
(m)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section:
a.
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, he shall submit prior notice to the city manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(4)
A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time he becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(5)
Bypass is prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notice as required under subsection (3) of this section.
(6)
The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (5) of this section.
(n)
Discharge of polluted waters to natural outlets or storm sewers prohibited. It is unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet or storm sewer within the county, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the county, any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other polluted waters, unless a permit for said discharge is first obtained from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
(o)
Special agreements and arrangements authorized. No statement in these regulations shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment by the industrial user.
(p)
Miscellaneous provisions.
(1)
Pretreatment charges and fees. The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of the costs of establishing and operating the city's pretreatment program that may include:
a.
Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications and the processing of such applications;
b.
Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analysis of a user's discharge and review of monitoring reports submitted by users;
c.
Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;
d.
Fees for filing appeals; and
e.
Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by these regulations and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city.
(2)
Conflict and precedence. These regulations, industrial wastewater discharge permits, and federal pretreatment standards are complementary, and what is called for by one is as binding as if called for by all. In the event there are conflicts in the documents, the several documents shall take precedence in the following order:
a.
Industrial wastewater discharge permit.
b.
Federal pretreatment standards.
c.
These regulations.
(3)
Industrial wastewater pretreatment system operators. Industrial wastewater pretreatment operators must comply with State of Georgia licensing requirements.
(4)
Severability. If any provision of these regulations is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(q)
Effective date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect immediately following their adoption by the City of Ball Ground Mayor and City Council.

Editor's note— Appendices F, L and M were not included in the codification of this section and can be found on file in the office of the city clerk.
Secs. 28-85—28-99. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 28-100. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate fees and charges for stormwater utility services, define the scope of responsibility, establishes an enterprise fund, credit and appeal policies, billing and collection policies, and other policies and procedures related to establishing the stormwater utility.
( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-101. - Findings.
The city council makes the following findings:
(1)
The Federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasize the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff.
(2)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city.
(3)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Providing stormwater management services, systems, and facilities renders both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the city.
(4)
The area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a stormwater service charge.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(6)
Stormwater runoff is associated with all developed properties, whether residential or non-residential, and the impacts of runoff from individual properties are directly related to the amount of impervious surface on a property.
(7)
The professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city properly assesses the stormwater management needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city.
(8)
The professional engineering and financial analyses identified a need to meet these goals and establish a funding mechanism in the city dedicated specifically for generating consistent, stable and adequate revenue to fund stormwater management services.
(9)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed through the city limits of Ball Ground. While specific service and facility demands vary from location to location, a service area that encompasses all lands and water bodies within the geographic limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(10)
The city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith.
(11)
Considering these findings, the city council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and the city council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city.
( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-102. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this article. Any word or phrase not defined below but otherwise defined in the Code of Ordinances shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
Creation of impervious surface means activity on land, with or without a certificate of occupancy, creating a slab, roof or paved area in excess of 200 square feet. Creation of impervious surface shall not mean graded parcels with no structures, graded soil, graded parcels containing only a compacted building pad, as examples.
Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater utility manager in accordance with the stormwater utility credit policy.
Customer means all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed.
Detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: Structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by other than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties.
Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon creation of impervious surface or final inspection if no such certificate is issued.
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the statistical average impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within the city. An ERU will be determined through engineering and analysis and will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. This unit may be used in the rate study evaluation to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the Ball Ground Stormwater Utility. An alternative unit of measure for impervious surface may be used for the rate structure. The methodology and basis for the stormwater service charge will be defined in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook.
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property.
Impervious surfaces means those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: The projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; gravel surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development.
Parcel means a designated parcel, tract, or area of land established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon.
Private stormwater management system means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality which are not public.
Public stormwater management system means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, public streets, curbs and gutters, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence either the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, which are either owned by the city or over which the city has accepted an offer of dedication of an easement or other legally binding permanent right of use for stormwater drainage, and for which the city has the obligation of maintenance for stormwater drainage purposes.
Service charges means the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city. The charge shall be used to fund the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Stormwater service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of each parcel to the demand for stormwater management services, shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. The cost of operating expenses, capital investments and reserve accounts may be included in the stormwater service charges. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city.
Single-family residential means a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being a residential dwelling.
Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: Detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage.
Stormwater utility guidebook means the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated.
Stormwater utility manager means the city manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the city stormwater utility. The stormwater utility manager will report to the public works director.
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-105. - User fee charges.
It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater programs, services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing programs, services and facilities and acquiring property. The cost of stormwater programs, services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, tolls, or licenses.
Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments.
The rate structure will be developed by June 2019 and will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. In order to fully recover the cost of providing stormwater management services and systems while fairly and reasonably apportioning the cost among developed properties throughout the city, the city will conduct an evaluation of rates.
The service charge will be based on the amount of impervious surfaces on a particular property that is developed, while undeveloped properties will not be assessed a stormwater utility fee. Stormwater utility rates will be reviewed on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the city council. While the rate structure has not yet been determined but will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Guidebook, the option for non-residential properties to be billed on a quarterly basis will be offered.
Real properties owned by and titled in the name of a local, state or federal government shall be exempt from stormwater assessments.
Commercial facilities that can show evidence of a zero-stormwater discharge to the municipal storm water system may be exempted from payment at the discretion of the city manager.
( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-106. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in Ball Ground shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in the stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities.
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels upon which the creation of impervious surfaces has not occurred;
(2)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks). However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges;

( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-108. - Credits.
(a)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to Ball Ground's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems.
(b)
Property owners of developed land may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The specific credits will be determined based on the guidelines in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. Credits for structural controls will be based on best management practices performance as defined by the design criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, First Edition, August 2001.
(c)
Credits may be partial or full credits and property owners can receive a maximum 40 percent credit.
(d)
Property owners seeking stormwater service charge credits must apply for stormwater service charge credits through completion and submittal to the Ball Ground of a stormwater service charge credit application.
(e)
Upon receipt of a completed application, Ball Ground shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within 45 days of the date the completed application was received by Ball Ground.
(f)
Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on: (1) continuing compliance with Ball Ground's design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article.
(g)
Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that Ball Ground received the completed application.
(h)
Applicants receiving credit for a structural control as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual must have an approved maintenance plan on file with the city and the applicant's property must have on-site stormwater management and treatment facilities.

Sec. 28-109. - Stormwater service fee, billing, delinquencies and collection.
(a)
The stormwater service fee may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other fees for services, at the city's sole discretion. Unpaid stormwater service fees may subject the customer to lawsuit.
(b)
A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, Ball Ground may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency due to the failure to send a bill or an under billing.
(c)
Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fiery facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the property. However, the owner shall be personally responsible for the fees.
(d)
A late charge of ten percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
( Ord. of 3-14-2019 )
Sec. 28-110. - Stormwater utility inspections and enforcement.
(a)
Every owner of developed real property located in the city, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, treat, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America.
(b)
When the stormwater utility manager determines that a public nuisance exists, the stormwater utility manager shall send a notice of maintenance requirements by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of maintenance requirements shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater utility manager shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater utility manager shall consider the following: Practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors.
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater utility manager determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of maintenance requirements has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record.
The notice of maintenance requirements shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: notice of maintenance requirements: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater utility manager that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense.
Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of maintenance requirements, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with the city for a hearing before the stormwater utility manager to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance.
(c)
Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of city court. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.
