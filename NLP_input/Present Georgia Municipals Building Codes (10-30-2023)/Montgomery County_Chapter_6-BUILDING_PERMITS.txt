Sec. 6-1. - Building permit required.
(a)
Any persons who intend to construct or cause to be constructed or alter the existing footprint of any building, facility or the like, for which the intended purpose is residential or commercial use, including, but not limited to, all new construction, alteration of floor plan, change in heated or unheated area, installation of pools, erection of communication towers and constructing or installing prefabricated, utility or accessory buildings, shall first make application for a building permit with the County Chief Tax Appraiser or his authorized agent. Such application shall be in a form and adopted by the Montgomery County Board of Tax Assessors and shall contain all necessary information as to size, type, use, location, scope of work, etc., of the intended construction, and be signed by the owner or his authorized agent acting on his behalf.
(b)
All questions on the application shall be clearly answered. Failure to answer, or the giving of misleading or false answers to the questions could possibly jeopardize the issuance of a permit, if in the discretion of the issuing officer such answers so justify.
(c)
If, in the opinion of the issuing officer, all questions have been answered acceptably, he may proceed to issue the permit, providing the applicant has acquired a septic tank permit from the County Health Department for any structure for which a septic tank is legally required. This requirement shall be waived if the intended building site is served by a public sewer and that such site can be tapped on to such system or a preexisting approved septic system.
(d)
The permit fees shall be in amounts as set forth in the Montgomery County Schedule of Fees.
