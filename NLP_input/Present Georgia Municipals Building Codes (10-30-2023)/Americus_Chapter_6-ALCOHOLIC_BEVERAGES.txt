The second audit will audit only the annual gross food and beverage sales, or annual gross sales, or total gross sales, as the case may be, during the probationary period and whether the entity attained the percentage required by the definition for that entity during the probationary period. Should the entity fail to attain the required percentage during the second audit, the entity will be informed, in writing, that it can no longer operate as that type of entity, e.g., a restaurant that fails to maintain the percentage required by the definition for that entity will be notified that it can no longer operate as a restaurant and may operate only as a bar. Should the licensee change its entity, for instance from a restaurant to a bar, it shall be the licensee's responsibility to assure that it complies with all the requirements of these ordinances of the city, including, but not limited to, any licensing applicable to that entity.

The entity may appeal the audit decision generated by a failure to meet the required percentage during the second audit. Any such decision to appeal must be made, in writing, and filed with the license review board no later than ten calendar days from and after the entity's receipt of the decision appealed. If the results of the second audit are mailed by the auditor to the licensee, that decision of the auditor is deemed received by the licensee three days from and after the decision is mailed and an additional copy filed with the city clerk. That notice of appeal must specify, in detail, why the entity believes the audit decisions are flawed. Where a hearing is scheduled by the license review board, the entity shall be provided written notice of such hearing no less than five calendar days prior to the date scheduled for the hearing. If the license review board upholds the auditor's decision, the entity shall have the right to appeal to the city manager. Any such appeal to the city manager must be in writing and filed with the city clerk and the city manager's office no later than ten calendar days from and after date on which the entity receives the decision of the license review board. If the decision of the license review board is mailed, that decision is deemed received by the licensee three days from and after the decision is mailed. The appeal to city manager shall contain the following: a detailed explanation of why the entity believes the audit results and the decision of the license review board is flawed; statistics showing the entity has complied with the percentage contained in the definition for that entity found in this chapter; a copy of the results of the first and second audits; and, a copy of the decision of the license review board. Failure of the entity to submit all of the appeal documents shall be fatal to the appeal. It shall be within the discretion of the city manager whether a hearing will be held on the appeal. If a hearing is scheduled by the city manager of the city, the entity shall be provided written notice of such hearing no less than five calendar days prior to the date scheduled for the hearing.
(6)
The appeals shall consider only evidence of sales during the audit periods and shall not consider evidence of any sales during the appeal periods.
(7)
The entity shall be allowed to operate during the time it is appealing the decision of the audit.

(Ord. No. O-2017-4, 4-20-2017)
Sec. 6-110. - Additional activities prohibited; rationale and findings; exception.
(a)
Rationale and findings.
Whereas, Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VII of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, delegates authority to counties and municipalities "for the purpose of regulating, restricting, or prohibiting the exhibition of nudity, partial nudity, or depictions of nudity in connection with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages;" and,
Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting the serving or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments; and,
Whereas, the Supreme Court of Georgia has upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting the serving or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments; and,
Whereas, among the undesirable community conditions identified with live nude entertainment and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior, and acceleration of community blight; Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, 490 F.3d 860 (11th Cir. 2007); 5634 East Hillsborough Ave., Inc. v. Hillsborough County, 2007 WL 2936211 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 4, 2007), affd, 2008 WL 4279670 (11th Cir. Sept. 18, 2008) (per curium); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); N Y. State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714 (1981); and,
Whereas, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in Chambers d/b/a Neon Cowboy v. Peach County, Georgia, 266 Ga. 318, 467 S.E.2d 519 (1996), held that local governments may adopt ordinances designed to combat the undesirable secondary effects of sexually explicit businesses, and further held that a governing authority seeking to regulate adult entertainment establishments must have evidence of a relationship between the proposed regulation and the undesirable secondary effects it seeks to control. The Georgia Supreme Court further held in the same opinion that in passing its regulations, a local government may rely on the experience of other counties and municipalities to demonstrate such a relationship; and,
Whereas, the United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that a local government may rely on the experience of other Cities in enacting legislation to regulate adult entertainment businesses; and,
Whereas, Federal and State appellate courts, have previously held that before enacting an ordinance to combat undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment, a legislative body is required to consider specific evidence of the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments that it reasonably believes relevant to the interests it seeks to address by passing the ordinance; and,
Whereas, based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties including, but not limited to, Fulton County, Georgia; Adams County, Colorado; New York City, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Sandy Springs, Georgia; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; City of St. Mary's, Georgia; Hamilton County, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Rome, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Manatee County, Florida; City of Garden Grove, California; Forth Worth, Texas; Houston, Texas; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Whittier, California; and the City of Los Angeles, California, which are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Americus, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Americus note the documented negative economic, physical, and social impact adult entertainment businesses have on the community; and,
Whereas, based upon the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences the mayor and city council of the city find are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within this country, the mayor and city council of the city find that public nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments offering adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia et al. v. Fulton County, Georgia, 596 F.3d 1265, 2010 WL 520542 (11th Cir. 2010); and,
Whereas, the mayor and city council of the city find and declare that nudity and sexual conduct and depiction thereof, coupled with alcohol in public places, encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare; and,
Whereas, the mayor and city council of the city have chosen to avoid the disturbances associated with mixing alcohol and nude dancing by means of a reasonable restriction upon establishments which sell spirituous or vinous liquors or malt or brewed beverages; and,
Whereas, the ordinance furthers important governmental interests of reducing crime and protecting property values which are unrelated to the suppression of speech; and,
Whereas, it is the intent of the mayor and city council of the city to enact an ordinance, narrowly tailored, sufficient to combat the undesirable secondary effects of the serving and consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment facilities; and,
Whereas, it is not the intent of the mayor and city council of the city, in enacting this article to deny to any person the right to speech or expression protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor it is the intent to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented performance or materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, but to adopt a content neutral ordinance to combat the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment where alcoholic beverages are served or consumed; and,
Whereas, this section is enacted to further the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city;
Now, therefore, this section is hereby enacted to further such health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city.

Secs. 6-113—6-130. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - SOCIAL HOSTING

Sec. 6-131. - Findings and intent.
The mayor and the city council find and declare as follows:
(a)
In 2007, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report entitled "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf. ("Surgeon General's Call to Action").
(b)
"Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder—that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page four.
(c)
"A higher percentage of youth in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades used alcohol in the month prior to being surveyed than used tobacco or marijuana, the illicit drug most commonly used by adolescents." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 5.
(d)
Various surveys have found that: approximately ten percent of children who are nine to ten years old have started drinking alcoholic beverages; nearly 33 percent of youth start drinking alcoholic beverages before the age of 13; more than ten percent of youth who are 12 to 13 years old and over 33 percent of youth who are 14 to 15 years old reported drinking a whole alcoholic beverage in the year before they were surveyed, and the peak years of alcohol initiation are when youth are in 7th and 8th grades. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page six.
(e)
While adolescents typically drink alcoholic beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcoholic beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at pages 6-7.
(f)
Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on private residences and other private property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it.
(g)
"Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten.
(h)
Underage drinking "[plays a significant role in risky sexual behavior, including unwanted, unintended, and unprotected sexual activity, and sex with multiple partners. Such behavior increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy and for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten.
(i)
Underage drinking increases the risk of physical and sexual assault." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten.
(j)
Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.
(k)
Underage drinking, "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid-to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.
(l)
Underage drinking, "creates secondhand effects that can put others at risk. Loud and unruly behavior, property destruction, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death because of underage alcohol use afflict innocent parties. For instance, about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.
(m)
Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on a private residence or other private property.
