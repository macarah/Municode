(b)
The term "due cause," for the purposes of this section, shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws involving the premises, the license, or occurring upon the premises.

Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages.
(4)
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor.

(5)
Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license. Included within this subsection, but not limited thereto, is the failure of a on the premises (pouring) license holder to meet the food sale requirements and the other requirements of this chapter, and which shall be a continuing condition for the validity of said license.
(6)
Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(c)
Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing.

At the hearing, the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence on its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the city council or the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation.
(f)
The city council or the hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten days of the completion of the hearing.

In the assessment of any penalties, the city council or the hearing officer can consider evidence presented by the licensee of any training program for employees instituted by the licensee, or to be instituted, to prevent further violations.
(1)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a license holder, including, but not limited to, any employee of the license holder while acting in the employment of said license holder, furnishes or causes to be furnished, sells, or permits any person in such employer's employ to furnish any alcoholic beverage to any person under 21 years of age, then for a first offense, the minimum penalty shall be a civil fine of $500.00 and a 30-day suspension of the right of the license holder to sell alcoholic beverages.

Furthermore, this provision shall not prohibit employees under the age of 18 who are employed in supermarkets, convenience stores, or drugstores from handling or carrying sealed packages of alcoholic beverages either within the licensed premises or to customers' vehicles when parked adjacent thereto as a part of employment responsibilities so long as such employees under age 18 do not sell any alcoholic beverage.

(b)
No licensee under this chapter shall permit any person to sell, dispense, serve or take orders for alcoholic beverages while that person is currently serving a sentence, including probation or parole, based upon a conviction in any state or federal court or the United States or in any foreign country for any felony, or any misdemeanor ordinance violating relating to the manufacture, sale, use or distribution of alcoholic beverages or narcotics or controlled substances, sexual offenses, or crimes of moral turpitude.

Each licensee shall establish written policies, a copy of which shall be posted within the licensed premises, governing the sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages in accordance with state law and this chapter. Licenses are encouraged to adopt disciplinary sanctions for employees who fail to meet the standards of law as violations by employees may constitute grounds for revocation, suspension or denial of a license under this chapter. The degree of training, supervision and discipline of employees by the licensee may be considered by the city council in determining action on any license.
(e)
It shall be the duty of the licensee and licensee's employees and agents to exercise reasonable discretion as to requiring customers to produce proper identification (e.g., state driver's license; U.S. passport; birth certificate) that indicates the customer is age 21 or older, prior to furnishing or causing to furnish, sell, distribute, or permit any person in the licensee's employ to furnish alcoholic beverages to said customer. For purposes of this subsection, the term "proper identification" means any document issued by a governmental agency containing a physical description of the person, such person's photograph, and such person's date of birth, and includes, without being limited to, a passport, military identification card, driver's license, or any identification card authorized by O.C.G.A. § 40-5-100.

The $30.00 fee shall include the fingerprinting performed by the police department.

(7)
An employee permit may be suspended or revoked by the chief of police or other agent of the city if it is determined that the individual has violated any provision of this chapter or committed any offense which would make him ineligible to hold such a permit.
(8)
Notification of any denial, suspension, or revocation of any employee permit shall be in writing and served either in person or by certified mail and shall contain the reasons for such action and the notice of the right to appeal the decision.
a.

(11)
No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold an employee permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid employee permit; provided, however, that an individual may be employed for a period of time not to exceed 14 days pending the submission of the application to and the approval of the permit by the police department.
(12)
It shall be the duty of the alcoholic license holder to file with the police department on a monthly basis a report which lists all employees employed in a capacity which would require an employee permit. Such report shall include the name and date of birth of all such individuals, as well as the same information on all such individuals who have terminated employment during the reporting period. Failure to submit said report to the police department by the 15th day of each month shall be a violation of this Code.

(b)
Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved in this section.
(1)
The requirements for approval are:
a.
The patio/open area must be enclosed by some structure (which may be a rope guard) providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The only exception to this would be a fire exit as required by building and fire codes. Such fire exit would not be for general public use unless an emergency exists and would be of the type which sounds an alarm so that the establishment would be alerted of unauthorized use if no emergency exists. The height of such structure may be a minimum of 3½ feet above the patio floor. The structure does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open area. The method or means of enclosure shall be flexible depending on the location of the premises, so long as there is substantial compliance with the requirement that ingress/egress be only through the main licensed premises. The building inspector or other city agent will make a case-by-case determination of compliance with the primary requirement being controlled access to the patio/open area.
b.
The patio/open area shall not be required to be covered by a roof. However, patio/open areas that are covered shall be covered by a roof.

It is prohibited for customers to leave the premises of a consumption on the premises licensee with alcoholic beverages and it is the licensee's responsibility to ensure that no beverages are sold and carried out. However, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of a partially consumed bottle of wine as provided by section 6-87. The owner of the business and the license holder and their agents and employees shall strictly enforce this provision, and the failure to do so will be a violation of this chapter and cause for revocation of the license.
g.
It shall be unlawful to knowingly sell, deliver or serve alcoholic beverages to a person in a state of noticeable intoxication or to allow persons in a noticeable state of intoxication to congregate on the premises, either inside, on any patio, or in an outside area or park, and it shall be the responsibility of the owner of the business and/or the license holder and their agents and employees to strictly enforce this provision and the failure to do so shall be cause for revocation of the license and constitute a violation of this chapter.

(2)
A bed and breakfast meeting the other requirements of this chapter except for the number of seats may serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises along with food at a full service eating establishment located in the bed and breakfast.
