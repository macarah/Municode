ARTICLE II. - SOIL EROSION, SEDIMENTATION AND POLLUTION CONTROL
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 402-1. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Norcross Soil Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-2. - Purpose and intent.
The real potential exists for excessive quantities of soil to erode from areas that are undergoing land disturbance such as housing developments, industrial sites, and roads. The resulting sediment could clog storm sewers and road ditches, add mud to streams and silt lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Excessive sediment limits the use of water for most beneficial purposes. Sediment choked streams are unsightly and their reduced channel capacity can result in flooding and associated damages, including the threat to the public health and safety. Therefore, it is the purpose of this article to effectively contain soil erosion and sedimentation on the parcels where land is being disturbed by requiring provisions for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces prior to, during, and after the land disturbance in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience, and general welfare of the citizens of city.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)

DIVISION 3. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

Sec. 402-9. - General provisions.
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for the application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the requirements of sections 402-10 and 402-11. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-10. - Minimum requirements/best management practices (BMPs).
(a)
Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 402-11 shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(b)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines as may be issued by the director. This section shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(c)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by city or of any state general permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(d)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(e)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 109-471(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-11. - Additional minimum requirements.
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation which are consistent with, and no less stringent than the state general permit, and those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, shall be observed by all land disturbers and plan preparers, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed areas and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. The disturbed area shall be stabilized with temporary vegetation or mulch if land-disturbing activity temporarily ceases for more than 14 calendar days;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. The disturbed area shall be stabilized with permanent vegetation if land-disturbing activity ceases for more than 30 calendar days;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this section, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings shall be kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 109-470(b);
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (16) below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5 of chapter 5 of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this section. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and it shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the construction site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and it shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the construction site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-12. - Proof or presumption of violation by injury.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a land-disturbing permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of, a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of a land-disturbing permit.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
DIVISION 4. - PERMIT APPLICATION AND PLAN REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 402-13. - General.

The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning resolution, storm water management regulations, subdivision regulations, flood damage prevention regulations, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-14. - Permit requirements.
(a)
Land-disturbing permit required. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city Community Development Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(b)
Application submittal. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city Community Development Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 402-15. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 402-10 and 402-11 of this UDO will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-.10.
(c)
Fees.
(1)
A land-disturbing permit fee, in an amount as established by a separate resolution by the Mayor and Council, shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
(2)
In addition to the land-disturbing permit fee, fees shall be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5.23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Georgia EPD; except that any and all fees due from an entity that is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or O.C.G.A. § 12-7-18(10) shall be submitted in full to the Georgia EPD regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(d)

Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 402-11(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 402-14(j) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(e)
Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
(f)
Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
(g)
Phased development. If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
(h)
Permit suspension, revocation, or modification. The land-disturbing permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or the holder's successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or the holder's successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a land-disturbing permit shall notify any successor in title to the holder as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
(i)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
(j)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.

All other ordinances or regulations referenced herein shall be administered by the directors of the departments of the city responsible for such codes and regulations as may be established by the Mayor and Council.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 402-17. - Inspection.
(a)
The Community Development Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which land-disturbing permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures and practices required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, with additional on-site recommendations of the department, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time period specified, the person shall be deemed to be in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The city Community Development Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as reasonably deemed necessary to carry out the duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(e)

The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority.
