Editor's note— Ord. of 9-18-2001, adopted Sept. 18, 2001, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article II, §§ 10-31—10-131, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 1059, §§ 1—32, 6-15-1993.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-31. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed; however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition, otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
The City of Suwanee finds that the regulation of the location of certain adult establishments is necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city as said establishments would not be appropriate in certain zoning classifications and adjacent to or near certain institutions. The city takes official notice of certain studies which have illustrated harmful secondary negative effects of adult establishments/sexually oriented businesses including increased crime, decreased property values, and increased blight. The city takes notice of and incorporates herein by reference as if fully set forth herein those certain studies and findings along with the public hearing of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners on July 17, 2001. Said hearing consisted of inter alia of testimony from law enforcement personnel and economic development experts.
The city incorporates herein by reference the National Law Center for Children and Families Study of thirty-two (32) communities in the United States of America and incorporates each study as if fully set forth herein.
The city also recognizes the right of speech grounded in the Georgia and U.S. Constitution and the manifestation of such through adult/sexually oriented businesses and the products and services they render. In seeking to protect this right the city finds the regulations set forth herein are the least restrictive means available in balancing this right while furthering the substantial governmental interests set forth above.
