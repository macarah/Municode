Sec. 78-27. - Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district in the city, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street or county road, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary line.
(2)
Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street or county road and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of the street or county road and as being parallel thereto.
(3)
Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the scaled distance from the lot lines. In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the zoning district boundary line.
(Code 2004, § 39-203)
Sec. 78-28. - District boundary lines as to through lot.
In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot.
