In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership, or if no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership will be licensed.
(c)
No person shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city administrator or his designee that such person, partners in the firm, or officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted of or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere and have been released from parole or probation for, any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant, nor any of the other owners of the establishment, have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to or entered a plea of nolo contendere and have been released from parole or probation to any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. An applicant's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.

The city council may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as herein set forth for the licensee.
(h)
All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the city administrator or his designee in such form as he may prescribe.
(i)
The city council, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If, in their judgment, circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.
(j)
For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.) as amended; except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.

No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued.
(d)
Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license, nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock which do not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock.
(e)
Except as provided above, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed establishment shall cancel and revoke any license hereunder automatically, without the necessity of any hearing.
(f)
