Sec. 3.09.03. - Specific requirements for timber lands.
(a)
Land that is used for silviculture shall comply with the requirements of subsection 3.09.03(b) or subsection 3.09.03(c), below.
(b)
Land that is declared silviculture shall be exempt from the requirements for tree protection provided that the following conditions are met:
(1)
A certificate from the tax assessor indicating agricultural preference;
(2)
A forest management plan, demonstrating compliance with the erosion control standards set forth in section 3.08.00; and
(3)
A commitment to follow the Georgia Forestry Commission's "Best Management Practices" as set forth in paragraph (e), below.
(c)
Land that has been designated silviculture may subsequently be developed, provided that a development plan has been prepared and approved by the zoning administrator prior to any clearing, grading, clear-cutting, or other land disturbance. The purpose of the development plan is to ensure that cutting or harvesting of trees occurs in such a manner as to avoid the practice called "clear-cutting" prior to any subsequent development.
(d)
Prior to clearing, harvesting, or cutting trees, or any grading or land disturbance, a combined timbering and logging permit shall be obtained from the county. The development plan shall include a forest management plan for the timberlands site. The management plan shall demonstrate compliance with erosion control standards set forth in section 3.08.00, protection of soil and water resources, and compliance with best management practices.
(e)
Georgia Forestry Commission's "Best Management Practices" (BMPs) include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Analyze and plan site preparation, taking into account all aspects of streamside management zones.
(2)
Avoid the cutting of roads or trails unless absolutely necessary. If roads/trails are necessary, do not locate them on ridge-tops and avoid use of soft roads/trails during wet ground conditions.
(3)
Avoid harrowing, root raking, or bulldozing.
(4)
When forestry activities are completed for a particular period of time, temporary access roads shall be retired. This includes reshaping, mulching, and seeding, in combination with water bars.
(5)
Leave logging debris on exposed soil, dry washes, and at points of concentrated drainage from skid trails and road. Do not pile debris in live or wet-weather streams.
(6)
Do not service logging equipment where it will have an impact on soil or water quality.
(7)
Skidding on steep slopes shall be done on a gradual grade rather than straight up the slope, and skidding shall be alternated between several skidding trails to minimize soil exposure and disturbance.
(f)
In addition to the BMPs set forth above and by the Georgia Forestry Commission, the property owner shall not conduct any other land-disturbing activities for a period of three years after the completion of such forestry practices.
