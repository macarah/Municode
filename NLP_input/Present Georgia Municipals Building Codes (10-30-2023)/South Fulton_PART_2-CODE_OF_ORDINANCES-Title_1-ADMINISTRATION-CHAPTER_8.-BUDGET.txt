CHAPTER 8. - BUDGET

Sec. 1-8001. - Purpose.
The purpose of this statement of financial policy of the city is to serve as a foundation for long- and short-term range planning, facilitate decision making, and provide direction to the city council and operational staff for handling the city's day-to-day financial business. Because of the diverse nature of the city's departments and committees, having written defined financial policies minimizes the risk of developing conflicting or inconsistent goals and objectives which could have a negative impact on the overall financial condition of the city.

Committed means financial resources whose use is restricted by action of the city council which will remain binding unless removed in the same matter creating the restriction.
Nonspendable means financial resources that will never convert to cash, that will not convert to cash soon enough to affect the current period, or that must be maintained intact pursuant to legal or contractual requirements.
Restricted means financial resources that are subject to externally enforceable legal restrictions such as debt covenants, federal or state grant requirements, private donors/contributors, or other governmental entities.
Unassigned means any residual net resources available after consideration of designation of nonspendable, restricted, committed or assigned fund balance.
(c)
The city's general fund may maintain all five components of fund balance.

(e)
The lowest level of fund balance classification for the city's capital project funds will be assigned fund balance for the funding of specific projects. An assigned fund balance will be spent first, unless the expenditure(s) is tied to a restricted fund balance amount. Once a project is completed, any fund balance remaining will be transferred back to the fund(s) which was the original funding source.
(f)
Debt service funds will only classify fund balances as nonspendable or restricted. When debt expenses are paid, the city will use restricted fund balance first.

In the event that governmental accounting standards change which eliminate the inclusion of the "Budgetary Comparison Schedule - General Fund," a statement of similar nature should be used in its place.
(1)
If the general fund's unassigned fund balance falls below the minimum targeted level as defined in this policy, the city council shall approve and adopt a plan to restore the general fund's unassigned fund balance to its target level within a 24-month period. If due to severe financial hardship of the city, the general fund's unassigned fund balance cannot be restored within this period, the city council shall establish a different time period.
(2)
Any general fund's unassigned fund balances which exceed the minimum level established by this policy may be appropriated by the city council for non-recurring capital projects, equipment or other operating uses.

The city shall classify its enterprise funds' net assets as restricted, unrestricted or invested in capital assets. The city's unrestricted net assets of all of its enterprise funds should be sufficient to cover operating expenses and infrastructure replacements.
