(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 2)
Sec. 18-293. - Definitions.
When used in this article the following words and phrases shall have meanings given in this section.
Hazardous waste. Any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) pursuant to the Federal Act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Sections 260 and 261, and as amended by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division Rules for Hazardous Waste Management (Chapter 391-3-11).
Lot. The contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use.
Perennial river/stream. A river/stream or section of a river/stream that has normal stream flow consisting of base flow or both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year.
Protected river corridor. All land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, as existing at the time of the application of this article; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area.
River/stream bank. The rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
Subdivision. All divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. This shall include all divisions or re-subdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads.

The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 3)
Sec. 18-294. - General provisions.
(1)
Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the county.
(2)
Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the county shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the Georgia Department of Public Health according to the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" Manual for On-site Sewage Management Systems; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this article as Appendix 1, if on-site sewage management is utilized, and/or the local County Board of Health determination under the Manual; and/or this or other local Ordinance, whichever is stricter (requires the largest lot size).
(3)
On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the county until site approval and an on-site sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the Emanuel County Health Department.
(4)
Permit coordination. The required permit under section 18-294(1) of this article shall not be issued until the Emanuel County Health Department issues an on-site site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article, including the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems." If the Emanuel County Health Department is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, the permit or letter under this subsection shall suffice as the permit required under section 18-294(1).
(5)
Requirements minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements.
(6)
Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the county shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to, Department of Transportation regulations, State Fire Marshal regulations, Georgia's Uniform Construction Codes, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act permits, and all other Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this article does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply.
(7)
Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this article because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners, or the Emanuel County Health Department if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this article shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in section 18-294(8).
(8)
Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners or the Emanuel County Health Department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at their own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division, and the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners, or and the Emanuel County Health Department if the Emanuel County Health Department is delegated responsibility for administering this article. Any costs for submission of evidence to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration.
(9)
Coordination with zoning and other regulation. This article shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this article shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirement(s) to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district.
(10)
Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this article shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates.
The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners from time to time.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 4)
Sec. 18-295. - Delegation of ordinance administration.
The Emanuel County Board of Commissioners, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the Emanuel County Health Department with responsibility for administering this article and ensuring compliance with its provisions.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 5)
Sec. 18-296. - Wetlands protection regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within Emanuel County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.
(2)
Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in Emanuel County and to be regulated areas under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Emanuel County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency.
(3)
Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (4) shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit issued under this article. Activities or uses permitted under Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this chapter have been satisfied.
(a)
If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular section is necessary.
(b)
If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article.
(c)
If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a Section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required.
(d)
No action in the administration of this article, or no local permit issued pursuant to this article, relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance.
(4)
Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the county to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no long term impairment for wetland function.
(a)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, Section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.)
(b)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require a Section 404 Permit.
(c)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, kayaking, and canoeing.
(d)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(e)
Normal agriculture activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
(5)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
(a)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(b)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 6)
Sec. 18-297. - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(2)
References map.The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in Emanuel County to be regulated areas under this article is the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)."
(3)
Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All uses except those identified in subsection (4) and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(a)
All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1 and following. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal and state requirements.
(b)
All single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DPH Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this article in Appendix 1), as determined by the Emanuel County Health Department. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the Public Health Manual. Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations or determination specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply.
(c)
All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located.
(d)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the Emanuel County Health Department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this article.
(e)
All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins.
(f)
All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or Georgia's Environmental Protection Division.
(4)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
(a)
All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities.
(b)
New facilities handling hazardous materials regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as to require a permit.
(c)
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins.
(d)
All new sanitary or other landfills.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 7)
Sec. 18-298. - Major river corridor protection district regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters.
(2)
District delineation. Protected Rivers as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Ohoopee River up to where the Little Ohoopee branches off and the Ogeechee River through Emanuel County meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100 foot natural vegetative buffer, as defined in Georgia Rule 391-3-16, is hereby established along the entire length of this river(s) within the jurisdiction of Emanuel County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank within the County jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100 foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses.
(3)
Permitted uses. No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100 foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, as long as they do not impair the long term functions of the protected river or the protected river corridor. In addition, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses.
(a)
Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the Emanuel County Health Department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100 foot buffer area.
(b)
Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the Emanuel County Health Department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances.
(c)
Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental rules and regulations.
(d)
Road and utility crossings, and utility locations if no other location is reasonable, providing the construction of these crossings and uses meet the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any other state or local requirements, if stricter, protect the integrity of the buffer area to the extent reasonably possible, and are located as far from the river bank as is reasonably possible.
(e)
Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
(f)
Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission or its successor, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
(g)
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 (as amended) of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title.
(h)
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
(i)
Wastewater treatment.
(j)
Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation.
(4)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
(a)
Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes.
(b)
Hazardous or solid waste landfills.
(c)
Septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer area under any circumstance.
(d)
Septic tanks within the 100-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with subsection 3(a).
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 8)
Sec. 18-299. - Variances.
When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this article, the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this article. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 9)
Sec. 18-300. - Violations and penalties.
Violation of these provisions, prohibitions, and installation restrictions by any private individual, land owner, builder, remodeler, contractor, licensed electrician, licensed plumber, septic tank dealer or installer, mobile or manufactured home dealer or mover, or developer; or installation and delivery of any utility services by a public or private utility to any property which holds a septic tank system installed against these prohibitions and restrictions, shall be a violation of this article.
Any person violating, neglecting, or refusing to comply with any provision of this article shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to such penalties as are provided by law. The Emanuel County Board of Commissioners may take other actions or remedies as available at law to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 2018-001, (Exh. A), § 10)
Sec. 18-301. - Court of jurisdiction.
