Any time a new nonresidential business is beginning operation in an existing structure, or any time a new tenant is to occupy an existing nonresidential structure, such person or entity shall be required to notify the building official and obtain an inspection prior to obtaining a business license and/or beginning tenancy (such requirements shall not apply to residential tenants such as apartment renters). It shall be unlawful to commence construction of a building or structure requiring a permit without first obtaining a permit, as required herein. It shall be unlawful to commence any land disturbance activity for the construction of any building; to commence construction of any building; to commence the moving or alteration of any building; or to commence the development of land for a use not requiring a building until all necessary permits for such work have been issued. Building permits shall be required as listed in this article, and land disturbance permits shall be as required by the soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. All land development or construction shall comply with the codes and ordinances in effect in the city at the time the permit is issued.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.20)
Sec. 10-40. - Other approvals as prerequisite.

(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.22)
Sec. 10-42. - Installation of industrialized homes.
Construction of industrialized homes is regulated by the state department of community affairs and not this article. However, installation of homes must meet manufacturer's specifications and the specifications of the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation, and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and foundation, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(1)
Installation requirements. Industrialized homes must be installed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 8-2-110 et seq. and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(2)
Utility connections. Utility connections prior to the final inspection of the installation will be considered temporary and will be approved only when arrangements for complete installations have been made.
(3)
Entry landing. All industrialized home installations shall provide an adequate means of entry (including steps and a landing at each doorway).
(4)
Sewage management. A septic permit or a sewer tap must be secured and provided to building inspections before an installation permit for an industrialized home will be permitted.
(5)
Foundations. The dwelling must be placed on a foundation and a curtain wall, unpierced except for required ventilation and access, and must be installed so that it encloses the area located under the home to ground level. Such a wall shall have a minimum thickness of four inches and shall be constructed of masonry or similar material as approved by the building official.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.23)
Sec. 10-43. - Swimming pools.
Any swimming pool shall be enclosed with a fence that is in compliance with the state minimum standard code (International Residential Code) and shall comply with the requirements of the zoning ordinance. Public swimming pools must also comply with applicable regulations of the county board of health.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.24)
Sec. 10-44. - Moved houses.
A house moved into or to another location in city must have the necessary improvements made so as to be in compliance with the state minimum standard codes that are in effect for new construction at the time the home is placed in its new location. Where any particular improvements that would be required to the moved house are technically unfeasible or impractical, or would be cost prohibitive (especially in relation to the benefit received or the purpose, goal, or intent of the standard or regulation at issue), a written request may be made to the building official requesting a recommendation that the exemption from the particular standard or requirement be granted and detailing why the request for exemption should be granted. Upon receiving the recommendation from the building official, the community development director may grant or deny the exemption. Any denial may be appealed to the unified zoning board. The exemption granted should not impair the public safety purposes of the state minimum standard codes and should be the minimum necessary.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.25)
Sec. 10-45. - Prohibited exterior materials; temporary repair exception.
It shall be unlawful to use roof or wall covering material that has not been approved by the applicable building code as exterior covering material except in the event a building is damaged by natural or manmade disaster or suffers a roof leak, other leak, or other damage. In such cases, temporary materials may be applied to a building to provide a temporary repair for no more than 60 days from the date of the damage. One 60-day extension can be requested from the building official, for cause, if the structure is not able to be properly repaired with approved exterior covering material within 60 days. Examples of materials that are not approved as exterior covering materials include, but are not limited to, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and OSB. This restriction shall not apply to a building that would not require a building permit to construct, such as outbuildings and storage buildings.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.26)
Sec. 10-46. - Partially-built structures.
The city finds that partially-built and subsequently abandoned homes and other buildings and structures are occurring more frequently and are an aesthetic harm to the community; they also reduce property values of adjacent and nearby property; they create a public safety hazard in that they can be dangerous; and they invite illicit activity. The city finds such structures to be a nuisance. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a property owner to leave a residential, commercial or industrial structure in a partially-built status for more than six months with no substantial progress occurring on the construction. Partially-built means foundations that are poured or erected, basements that have been dug and partially completed, and structures that have been framed or dried-in (siding, roofing, windows and doors in place) but not completed. It shall be permissible to finish the exterior of a commercial shopping center or other commercial or industrial building without building-out the inside. It shall also be a violation for a partially completed building or structure to remain unfinished without a certificate of occupancy more than 30 days after the expiration of its building permit (building permits expire one year from issuance unless extended). The building official shall be authorized to issue citations to the property owner or builder and shall be authorized to seek abatement of the nuisance in municipal court or superior court.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.27)
Sec. 10-47. - Commercial car washes.
Any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined herein) that is permitted and constructed shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. A "commercial conveyor car wash" is a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not). These restrictions shall not apply to self-service car wash bays or in-bay car washes where the car remains stationary and the wash equipment moves around the vehicle.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.28)
Sec. 10-48. - Retaining walls.
(a)
Permit required. A building permit shall be required for any retaining wall that exceeds three feet in exposed wall height or exceeds two feet in exposed wall height and supports a surcharge. A building permit application shall require a site plan showing the location, extent, and height of the retaining wall in relation to any building structure, pool, property lines, and public utility easements. It shall also require complete construction details of the retaining wall and structural calculations for the wall, both stamped and signed by a professional engineer.
(b)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Exposed wall height means the vertical distance measure from the finish grade at the bottom of the wall (lower soil grade) to the finish grade at the top of the wall (upper soil grade). This height does not include the wall and depth of footing below grade.
Retaining wall means a wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
Surcharge means a vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include sloping retained soil, structure footings supported by the retained soil, adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil, and solid fences that are attached or directly adjacent to a retaining wall when wind pressures act on the fence.
(c)
Tiered retaining walls. Use of tiered walls is a special condition where two or more short walls, horizontally offset from one another, are used in lieu of a single tall retaining wall. When tiered walls are not properly offset from each other, the upper wall may impose a surcharge condition on the lower wall. In order for the walls to be treated as separate retaining walls, a general rule of thumb is that the tiered walls be horizontally offset by a minimum distance of two times the exposed wall height of the lower wall. For example, two tiered retaining walls, each with an exposed wall height of three feet and level backfill, which are horizontally offset by a distance of two feet, would be treated as a single six-foot-tall wall. As a result, a building permit would be required.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.29)
Sec. 10-49. - Permits.
The building official is authorized to issue permits under the state minimum standard codes and to make inspections in relation to enforcing and administering those codes and this article.

(2)
A structure used for housing animals, poultry, etc., or for other agricultural practices, which is not open to the public;

(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.34)
Sec. 10-54. - Permit issuance.
When the building official issues a permit that requires plans to be submitted, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans: "Reviewed for Issuance of Construction Permit." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official, and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. In the event the particular permit does not require plans to be submitted, only a copy of the permit shall be kept by the building official.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.35)
Sec. 10-55. - Permit duration.
A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of this article. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is completed within 12 months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 12 months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 12 months, may be allowed for the permit.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.36)
Sec. 10-56. - Permit posted.
Work requiring a permit shall not commence until the permit holder or his agent posts the permit card in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such permits must be placed on a post or other structure at least three feet off the ground and no more than two feet back from the right-of-way, so as to be easily visible to the inspectors and passersby. The permittee shall be responsible for ensuring a clear and legible permit is on display at all times. If permit is not properly posted, no scheduled inspections will occur, and a re-inspection fee will be charged before any further inspections will be scheduled. In the event of damage or loss, a replacement permit shall be immediately obtained and displayed. This permit card shall be maintained in such position by the permit holder until the certificate of occupancy or completion is issued by the building official.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.37)
Sec. 10-57. - Denial of permit.
If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the state minimum standard codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. Appeals shall be to the unified zoning board.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.38)
Sec. 10-58. - Compliance with licensing requirements.
It shall be the duty of every contractor who contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, or electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with all state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing. In cases where the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the building official with their license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.40)
Sec. 10-59. - Application requirements.

The application shall be signed by the owner, or his authorized agent. The building permit application shall indicate the proposed occupancy of all parts of the building and of that portion of the site or lot, if any, not covered by the building or structure. The application shall provide such information as is required to confirm compliance with this article and applicable codes and shall be accompanied by drawings or site plans as are required for these purposes. Issuance of a building permit is not a guaranty that the erection of the structure is lawful and in compliance with all other applicable ordinances.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.41)
Sec. 10-60. - Additional application requirements.
Each application for a building permit shall also be accompanied by the following:

Sec. 10-95. - Unified zoning board.
For purposes of this article, the unified zoning board shall serve as the construction board of adjustment and appeals. The unified zoning board shall have the power to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances of the state minimum standard codes more specifically as listed in sections 10-96 through 10-100.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.77)
Sec. 10-96. - Appeals.
The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his contractor, may appeal a decision of the building official to the unified zoning board whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist:
(1)
The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system;
(2)
The provisions of the applicable code do not apply to this specific case;
(3)
That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case; or
(4)
The true intent and meaning of the codes or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted.
(Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.78)

Sec. 10-98. - Variances.
(a)
The unified zoning board, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provisions of the codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this article or state minimum standard codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service systems involved and which are not applicable to others;
(2)
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other building, structure or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service systems; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this article and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the building official, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Generally, variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, unless otherwise specified. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied.
(c)
A site plan prepared and signed by a state licensed surveyor or engineer shall be submitted with all variance applications unless the community development director determines that such a site plan will not meaningfully assist the unified zoning board's consideration of the application.
