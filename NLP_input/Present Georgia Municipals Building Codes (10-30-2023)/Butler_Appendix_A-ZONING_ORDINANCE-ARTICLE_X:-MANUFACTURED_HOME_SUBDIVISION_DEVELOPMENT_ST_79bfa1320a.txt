Review and Approval of MHS Application:
1.
An application for approval of an MHS request is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (a rezoning). This is because MHS districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed MHS. Upon approval of the MHS, existing zoning must be changed to an MHS zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in Article XXVI, must be followed in granting the amendment to permit MHS. Approval of MHS zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the City Council.
2.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map of Butler will be changed to indicate the MHS district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the Zoning Administrator the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
3.
The official map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the Zoning Administrator.
4.
No building permits will be issued by the Zoning Administrator until the development plan has been approved by the City Council.
D.
Issuance of Building Permits. The Zoning Administrator will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan, if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule and all other applicable regulations.
E.
Revision of Development Plan After Approval.
1.
Minor extensions, alterations or modification of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the City Council; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator and City Council after receipt of recommendations from the Zoning Administrator and City Council in accordance with the provisions of Article XXVI. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
