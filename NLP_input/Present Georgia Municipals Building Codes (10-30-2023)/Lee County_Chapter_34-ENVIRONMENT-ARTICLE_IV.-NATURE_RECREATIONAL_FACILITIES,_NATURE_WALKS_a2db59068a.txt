Sec. 34-201. - Permit required.
Any owner or operator of any nature recreational facility located or to be located within the county shall be required to obtain a permit from the office of planning and zoning of the county. The term "nature recreational facilities" shall mean any facility which offers to the public outdoor recreational activities, including, but not necessarily limited to, nature trails, bicycle trails, equestrian trails, including those which result from the abandonment of railroad right of way under federal law, as well as all other such nature recreational facilities as may be within the above definition, regardless of the zoning district or districts in which such nature recreational facilities are located.
(Ord. of 9-17-2001)
Sec. 34-202. - Permit application.
(a)
The application for a nature recreational facility permit shall be submitted to the planning and zoning department of the county. The application shall be accompanied by a non-refundable nature recreational facility permit application fee of $500.00. Said application fee shall be required only in connection with the initial nature recreational facility permit application, and shall not be required for any subsequent renewal as specified in subsection 34-202(b). The planning and zoning department shall issue such permit so long as all fees are paid and the permit complies with the provisions of section 34-203. The planning and zoning department shall have a period not to exceed 60 days in which to approve or disapprove of the permit application. If no action is taken by the planning and zoning department upon the permit application within such 60-day period, then the permit shall be deemed granted. In the event that the application for a nature recreational facility permit is denied, notice of and reasons for the denial thereof shall be provided to the applicant for the permit, and such applicant may file a request for reconsideration with the planning and zoning department within ten days after receipt of notice of such denial. In the event the application is denied upon reconsideration, such applicant may appeal such denial to the board of commissioners of the county within 20 days after receipt of notice of such denial, and the board of commissioners will hold a hearing on such appeal within 15 days after receipt of notice of such appeal. At such hearing, the applicant shall be authorized to present any relevant evidence it desires to present in defense of or mitigation with respect to the matter before the board of commissioners.
(b)
Each owner or operator of a nature recreational facility located within the county shall be required to prepare every two years a review application, detailing the nature recreational facility's fulfillment of its requirements as set forth under the provisions of section 34-203. Said review application shall not require a processing fee or any other fee, and shall be due December 31 of each odd numbered year. If at the time of filing the review application the requirements of section 34-203 are not satisfied, the permit of the nature recreational facility may be subject to suspension or revocation by the county commission pursuant to subsection 34-205(b). In such a situation, the procedures governing the suspension or revocation of the permit set forth in section 34-205 shall govern.

In the event that the county's water and sewer system provides service within 150 feet of the site of any such restroom, such restroom facility shall be connected to the county's water and sewer system. Upon notice to the county administrator's office of upcoming special events, and upon approval by the county administrator of an application by the nature recreational facility owner or operator within 15 days of such special events, portable restroom facilities may be available in conjunction with such special events.
