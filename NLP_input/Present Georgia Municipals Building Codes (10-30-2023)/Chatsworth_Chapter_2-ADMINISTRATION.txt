(2)
These policies and procedures are deigned to ensure that all city funds are expended in accordance with sound business practices, recorded in compliance with acceptable accounting procedures, and meet the requirements of federal and state agencies that may assist in the financing activities of the city.
(3)
The purchasing policy will apply to all city departments and to other agencies, authorizes, commissions, and joint-ventures as the governing authority may deem appropriate.
(4)
The city and council reserves the right to accept or reject any or all bids received and to waive informalities and to re-advertise.
(b)
General policies.
(1)
Full and open competition. The city will make every effort to obtain high quality goods and services at the best possible price. All procurement procedures will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with the avoidance of any impropriety. All purchasing transactions are subject to the state's Open Records Act.
(2)
Gratuities and gifts. To reduce the potential for conflicts of interest, abuse of position, or even the appearance of impropriety, the city limits gifts employees or officials may receive from originations, business concerns, or individuals with which they have (or may have in the future) official relationships concerning the business of city government. Employees may receive an occasional meal, promotional items routinely distributed by vendors, and de-minimis holiday gifts.
(3)
Disclaimer of responsibility. The city will not be responsible or liable for any expenditures or agreement for expenditure made by a city employee, city official, or an employee of any department utilizing public funds who fails to follow this purchasing policy and procedures. It is considered a "breach of duty" on the part of any employee who procures goods or services not consistent with the purchasing policy. Any breach will be reported to the city clerk in writing.
The mayor and council may disclaim responsibility for any expenditure or agreement for expenditure arising from a procurement of goods or services made in its name, in the name of any governmental department under its fiscal authority, by an unauthorized person acting outside these policies. The cost of any such disclaimed transactions will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly.
(c)
Specific policies.
(1)
Each department head is responsible for the enforcement of these policies and procedures within their respective department(s). The department head may delegate the purchasing responsibility to employees within their department.
(2)
Departments will be responsible for providing the city clerk with all purchase receipts with the date of purchase. Purchase order numbers are to be given to each invoice/receipt of purchase. Purchase order numbers shall be given by the city clerk's office. For credit card purchases, a PO number shall be issued when the receipt of purchase is given to the city clerk.

The city clerk, the financial chairman and the mayor will have the authority to review all invitations to bid issued on behalf of the city and to question the quality, and type of commodity or service requested.

Purchase order procedures. Purchasing by any city employee for any department will be handled in the following manner:
(1)
A city employee may make a purchase up to $2,000.00 with an assigned purchase order number and with the approval of the city clerk or his/her designee;
(2)
If the purchase is over the amount of $2,000.00 the financial chairman and/or the mayor shall give approval of the purchase order; and
(3)
Purchases made with an amount less than $2,000.00 the department head or his/her designee shall approve.
(e)
City credit card purchases. Purchases made and charged to the city's credit card should be infrequent and used primarily for travel related expenses, certain internet purchases, and educational purposes. Normal purchasing procedures should apply when using the city's credit card. The credit card is simply a payment method. Under no circumstances shall the city's credit card be used for personal purchases, even to reimburse later by the employee.
(f)
Computer hardware and software purchases. Proposed purchases of computer hardware and software must be reviewed by the finance committee, as well as the city clerk, and the IT director, to ensure compatibility with the city's equipment and network system.
(g)
Emergency purchases.

All emergency purchases will require the finance committee to sign off on the purchase order prior to the payment issued by the city clerk.
(h)
Cancellation or rejection of bid or proposal. The mayor and council reserves the right to cancel any outstanding formal sealed bid or proposal prior to the opening of the bid or proposal and also reserves the right, after the bid opening, but prior to the award of a bid, to reject, in whole or in part, any bid or proposal. Any cancellation or rejection will be consistent with the procurement policies and procedures.
(i)
Sole source vendor. A sole source situation exists when there is only one vendor who can provide the product or service or a particular brand is required for compatibility or repair. Sole source procurement is permissible if a required good or service is available from only a single supplier.
(j)
Budget allocation and control. Unless a budget appropriation is available, no procurement will occur which obligates the city to pay for goods or services. Each respective department head or designee has the responsibility of reviewing the budget availability prior to beginning the ordering of goods or services. The budget can be overridden by the finance committee only in the event of an emergency purchase and when a contract or bid has been approved by vote of the mayor and council.
Please note that any federal, or state grant-contract procurement requirements preempt local policy. It is the responsibility of the department administering the grant or contract to follow stated contractual, procurement noncompliance can result in the city paying back funds to the federal-state agency.
(k)
Requirements.

Any purchase requiring a signed contract (services, construction, etc.) will be given to the city attorney for review.
(3)
Request for proposals (RFP). Formal sealed proposals may be used when clear specifications are not available or when a service is required. In this procurement method qualifications will normally be the primary issue and price may not be used in the evaluation to the proposal.
