ARTICLE 1. - DEFINITIONS

Sec. 3-4-1. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter:
Emergency management. As used in this chapter, the term "emergency management" shall mean the preparation for and the carrying out of all emergency and disaster functions, other than those functions for which military forces or state and federal agencies are primarily responsible, to prevent, minimize, and repair injury and damage resulting from emergencies or disasters, or the imminent threat thereof, of manmade or natural origin. These functions include, without limitation, firefighting services; police services; medical and health services; rescue, engineering, warning services; communications; protection against the effects of radiological, chemical, and other special weapons; evacuation of persons from stricken areas; emergency welfare services; emergency transportation; plant protection; shelter; temporary restoration of public utility services; and other functions related to civilian population, together with all other activities necessary or incidental to total emergency and disaster preparedness for carrying out the foregoing functions.
Locally declared emergencies. As used in this ordinance, a "locally declared emergency" or a "declaration of local emergency" shall mean a declaration by the manager (to include a designated assistant manager as authorized by Section 3-4-2(a) of this Chapter) or the Mayor and Commission of the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia enacting some or all of the local emergency powers addressed in this ordinance.
Overcharging. Charging prices for goods, materials, services or housing which are substantially in excess of the customary charges, or in applicable cases, substantially in excess of the suppliers' or providers' costs for such goods, materials, services or housing. The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a substantial increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency.
State declared emergencies. As used in this ordinance, a "state declared emergency" or a "state of emergency" shall mean a declaration by the Governor of an actual or impending emergency or disaster of natural or human origin, or pandemic influenza emergency, or impending or actual enemy attack, or a public health emergency, within or affecting Georgia or against the United States. A declaration of emergency by the Governor may enact some or all of the emergency powers, local or otherwise, addressed in this ordinance.
Subsequent recovery period. That period during which the disaster continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated.
