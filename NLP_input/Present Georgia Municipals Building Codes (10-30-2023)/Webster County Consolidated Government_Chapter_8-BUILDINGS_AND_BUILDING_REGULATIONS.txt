ARTICLE V. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND TOWER STANDARDS[3]

Sec. 8-112. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of communications towers and antennas to serve the residents and businesses of the county.
(2)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscaping, screening and innovative camouflaging techniques.
(3)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
(4)
Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas.
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing communications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county; provided, however, that the use of shorter towers of a height which does not require lighting under FAA regulations will normally be given preference over the use of taller lighted structures even when the use of unlighted structures may require a larger number of towers to serve the county.
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers.
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new communications towers in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Code 2003, § 14-151)
Sec. 8-113. - Definitions.
modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alternative tower and antenna structure means manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, church steeples, light poles, flagpoles and similar alternative design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers so as not to be readily discernible as an antenna or tower. In order to establish quantitative and qualitative standards for determining that an alternative tower structure is not readily discernible, nine examples (photographs) of such non-readily discernible structures are included in the appendix to the ordinance from which this article is derived.
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves.
FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.
Height, when referring to a tower or other structure, means the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if such highest point is an antenna.
Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term "tower" includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like.
Tower owner means and includes the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, antennas or associated equipment as well as any parent or subsidiary companies of such entities.
(Code 2003, § 14-152)
Sec. 8-114. - Tower restrictions.
Any tower which is constructed in the county must be constructed in an area which is at least twice as far as the tower to be constructed is tall from any adjoining landowner's property if the adjoining landowner's property consists of any structures, buildings, or dwelling places. The purpose of this restriction is to ensure that no tower is placed directly beside an adjoining landowner's property in such a manner that the tower could either aesthetically affect the value of the adjoining landowner's home site or other structures, and to ensure that the tower poses no risks of striking a structure of any type if it should fall. The adjoining landowner may waive this requirement if a contractual agreement is reached between the tower owner and the adjoining landowner. There is no requirement for the adjoining landowner to make this waiver and it can only be obtained if the adjoining landowner contracts to waiver or voluntarily waives this right.
(Code 2003, § 14-153)
