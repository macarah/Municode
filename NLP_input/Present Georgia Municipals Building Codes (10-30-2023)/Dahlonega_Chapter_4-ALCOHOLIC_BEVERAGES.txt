In the event that a license has been revoked by the administrative hearing officer, and the licensee has appealed such revocation to the superior court, or the time for filing such an appeal has not expired, consideration or issuance of any application for renewal of such license for a subsequent year shall be suspended until final judgment in the appeal has been entered by the court or the revocation has become final with no appeal being filed.

Taxes and fees. All taxes, fees, and utility bills due to the city must be paid prior to license issuance or renewal.
(j)
State license; forfeiture for failure to comply; revocation of state license. A state alcoholic beverage license must be obtained by the applicant in order for the license issued by the city to be valid. Failure of the licensee to obtain a state license before beginning operation of the premises shall result in cancellation of the license issued by the city, and no refund of license fees shall be made to the licensee. If a state alcoholic beverage license is revoked or suspended by the state, then the license issued by the city shall automatically be revoked or suspended as of the date of such revocation or suspension and, in the case of suspension, for an identical term.

Objections to ownership. After receipt of application and notice of ownership interests, where city investigation determines that one or more persons disclosed in the application are ineligible to hold an interest in an alcoholic beverage license in the city, the city council shall notify the applicant and disqualified person within a reasonable time of any objections to the ownership or interest set forth therein, and it shall then be incumbent upon the disqualified person to dispose of such interest within 30 days after the mailing of the notice to do so by the city council to such person at his address as shown on such notice of interest; the applicant shall provide proof to the city of the change of interest required. No license shall be issued by the city until removal of the disqualified person has been verified. In the event a disqualifying interest is discovered during the renewal process, the applicant shall be given the same 30-day period to correct the defective interest after the mailing of the notice by the city council. Upon failure of an existing license holder to complete the substitution of a qualified interest for a disqualified interest, then the license as provided for in this section is subject to revocation until disposition of the interest has been made or notice given to the city council of the transfer. Notice and hearing before the administrative hearing officer shall be required to determine the issue of revocation.

(4)
Whether the location of the proposed business would be in violation of the zoning ordinance or other similar regulation of the city;
(5)
Whether the location is the same as that at which a previous license has been revoked or suspended, and where, in the judgment of the city council, the problems which have arisen from the operation of an alcohol license at such location indicate that it is not in the interest of public health, safety, welfare or morals that the sale of alcoholic beverages be permitted at such location;

Monetary penalties in the form of civil fines of up to $1,000.00 may be imposed. Nonjudicial sanctions shall be administered by citation and subpoena to the municipal court, the judge of said court acting as the administrative hearing officer for purposes of hearing all citations for violations of this article and the administering of nonjudicial sanctions. The administrative hearing officer shall consider the following factors in reviewing an alleged violation if a violation is found to exist:

(2)
Any previous violations within a five-year period;

No license shall be renewed if any civil fines imposed pursuant to this section have not been paid by the licensee prior to renewal. For purposes of administering and enforcing this article, any act committed by an employee, agent or representative of a licensee shall be deemed to be an act of such licensee, provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of due diligence could not have discovered or prevented such activity. A nonjudicial sanction shall be considered a conviction when the term "conviction" is used elsewhere herein. The term "conviction" shall also have its usual and normal meaning of an adjudication adverse to a defendant or a plea of guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)
The term "due cause," for purposes of the imposition of nonjudicial sanctions, shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)
Conviction (to include a plea of guilty or nolo contendre) by local, state or federal authorities of the licensee including persons holding an ownership interest in the licensee or the manager of the licensee for any ordinance or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or any felony involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, or tax law violations.

Any violation of this article, including, but not limited to, violations upon the licensed premises or by persons acting on behalf of the licensee with respect to the violation.
(4)
Suspension or revocation of any state license required as condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages.
(5)
Material falsification of any fact given in application for a license issued under this article or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor, or any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this article.

Notice shall be served at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Any licensee requiring subpoenas to compel the attendance of city witnesses or documents at the hearing shall file a written request with the city clerk at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued for good cause only.
(d)
Hearings shall only be as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney or his designee shall present the city's case and shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend, revoke or probate the license or to assess fines or other penalties. The licensee may be represented by legal counsel, may confront and cross examine witnesses, and shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence on his behalf. A hearing record shall be maintained by the city; however, either party may arrange for transcription by a court reporter at his sole expense. Hearings shall be presided over by the administrative hearing officer who shall preserve order and rule upon all matters of evidence. Irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
(e)
All final decisions to suspend, revoke, or place a licensee on probation or to invoke fines or other penalties shall be made by the administrative hearing officer, in writing, with the reasons therefor stated. Notice of a final decision shall be given to the licensee within three business days following the date of the hearing.
(f)
Appeals from an action by the administrative hearing officer to revoke, suspend or probate a license pursuant to this article shall be by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county.
