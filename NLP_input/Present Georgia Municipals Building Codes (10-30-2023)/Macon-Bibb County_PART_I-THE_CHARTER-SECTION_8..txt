SECTION 8.
Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the duties of the sheriff, the tax commissioner, the coroner, and the clerk of the superior court shall remain as such duties are presently imposed by law for such respective officers as county officers; provided, however, that such duties may be expanded and enlarged by the governing authority to include like duties and responsibilities in connection with the affairs of the restructured government. The compensation paid to any such officer shall be fixed as heretofore provided by law and may not be reduced during his or her term of office below the amount of such compensation as fixed at the commencement of such term, nor shall his or her compensation during his or her term of office in effect upon the effective date of this charter be reduced below the salary then being paid such officer. Such compensation as so fixed shall be the sole remuneration to such officers for their services and any and all other compensation for such services to Macon-Bibb County, the State of Georgia, or any agency thereof, including salaries, fees, commissions, fines, or forfeitures received from any source whatsoever, shall be the property of Macon-Bibb County and paid into its treasury.
