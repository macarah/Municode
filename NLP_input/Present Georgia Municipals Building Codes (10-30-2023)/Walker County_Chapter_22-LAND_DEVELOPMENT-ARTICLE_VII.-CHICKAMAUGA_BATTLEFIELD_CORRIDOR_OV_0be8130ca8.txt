ARTICLE VII. - CHICKAMAUGA BATTLEFIELD CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS

Sec. 22-447. - Introduction.
New development within the Chickamauga Battlefield Corridor Overlay District is expected to be designed with these design guidelines in order to maintain the uniqueness that the Chickamauga Chattanooga National Military Park lends to its surrounding area; the beauty of mountains and meadows; the historic venues; the rural lifestyle; and the County's heritage and its desire to reflect this unique charm. These design guidelines provide a set of criteria that shall be used in all new development within this area for development that will complement the historical nature of the surrounding community. The ultimate goal of these design guidelines is to direct physical and visual changes to create an architecturally and physically cohesive area of specified historic character. These design guidelines are meant to create a strong identity for the Chickamauga Battlefield Corridor area as a distinctive place to shop, visit, work, and live, and are a means of bringing together the interests of individual property owners and the general public to achieve mutual benefits.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 1.01)
Sec. 22-448. - Purpose and intent.
The guidelines are intended to help site planners and urban designers look beyond their individual buildings and single parcels of land, to shape the physical features of their development in a manner consistent with preferred principles of community design.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 1.02)
Sec. 22-449. - Site planning.
(a)
The site plan, building design, and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance that will enhance and be compatible with the historic character of the surrounding area.
(b)
Site planning and design of projects proposed (adjacent to dissimilar land uses) should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns. Due to these issues, some land uses are not permitted in the Corridor area. Please see appendix A to this chapter.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 1.03)
Sec. 22-450. - Protecting the natural environment.
(a)
The purpose of this section is to:
(1)
Evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development.
(2)
Conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Development shall be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment.
(3)
Significant site features such as habitats, natural ground forms, existing site vegetation, large rock outcroppings, water, and significant view corridors shall be identified and incorporated into development plans. Where possible, a diversity of habitats is preferred.
(b)
Riparian zones, stream corridors, and wetlands shall be protected for their wildlife habitat and other values. Development plans for these areas would treat these components as assets. A continuous, connected, natural vegetative corridor shall be preserved along all creek and stream corridors to provide stream quality protection and for the efficient movement of wildlife throughout the area. No fill, removal, or modification of a riparian area will take place, unless there is no reasonable and feasible alternative. The alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas where permitted, will ensure that potential losses are mitigated and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage. (See Figure 10.)
Figure 10. Retention of Vegetated
Stream Corridor
(c)
Existing vegetation shall be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation will be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation is to be enhanced with plantings of the same variety.
(d)
Preserve patches of high-quality habitat, as large and circular as possible, feathered at the edges, and connected by wildlife corridors. (See Figure 11.)
Figure 11. Habitat Patch Preservation
and Connection
(e)
When continuous greenspace corridors cannot be provided or must be broken up for road access or other valid reasons, patches shall be retained as stepping stones for wildlife corridors. (See Figure 12.)
Figure 12. Stepping Stones
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 1.04)
Sec. 22-451. - Site grading.
(a)
Developments shall be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork. Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged.
(b)
Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is to be avoided, as is the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts.
(c)
The height and length of retaining walls must be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Terracing should be used as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides. Disturbed areas that are not used for roads, buildings, or other auxiliary uses are to be replanted.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 1.05)
Sec. 22-452. - Drainage.
(a)
Natural on-site drainage patterns shall be used where practicable. Detain runoff with open, natural drainage systems where possible.
(b)
Design manmade lakes and stormwater ponds for maximum habitat value and/or to serve as amenity features. (See Figure 13.)
Figure 13. Drainage Feature as an Amenity

DIVISION 2. - COMMERCIAL USES

Sec. 22-473. - Introduction.
Notwithstanding other land development regulations to the contrary, this division shall apply to any commercial business seeking to locate within the boundaries of this Corridor Overlay District subsequent to the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived. As performance standards, the provisions herein are general, allowing for flexibility in their application at the discretion of the Design Review Board (DRB) and the Planning Commission.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 2.01)
Sec. 22-474. - General compliance.
Proposed C-1 commercial developments within the Corridor Overlay District shall conform to all regulations in all sections of the Walker County Building Code except that, in cases of conflict, provisions stated in this division supersede conflicting provisions of other sections of the Code.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 2.02)
Sec. 22-475. - Purposes and intent.
The purposes of this division are to:
(1)
Provide general performance standards by which applications for commercial development will be evaluated and approved by the Planning Commission and Design Review Board (DRB), and by which the actual performance of those operations and uses will be monitored by the County for compliance.
(2)
Protect the County in general, and abutting and neighboring landowners in particular, from potential negative impacts that new commercial uses may have on the physical environment, efficient use of County resources, and the quality of life enjoyed by County residents.
(3)
Facilitate clustering of businesses and structures, and locations of buildings closer to streets, reflecting the traditional building pattern of the Corridor District.
(4)
Facilitate sharing of access points from highways, and driveway connections linking businesses on adjoining properties.
(5)
Help developers successfully integrate new construction into rural landscapes by promoting permanent open space between clusters of roadside commercial development conserving views of surrounding countryside.
(6)
Promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(7)
Reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in commercial development.
(8)
Preserve unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, farmland, wetlands, streams, mature trees, the darkness of the night sky, and/or historic sites and resources.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 2.03)
Secs. 22-476—22-503. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - COMMERCIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES

Sec. 22-504. - General layout of areas, sites and structures.
In addition to avoiding environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, steep slopes and significant groundwater recharge areas, layouts should avoid environmentally-sensitive or historically or culturally significant areas, such as, but not limited to, archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds; important historic sites and structures; significant trees (larger than 12 inches' caliper). Floodplains should be addressed using guidelines established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency under the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.01)
Sec. 22-505. - Maximum setback.
Retail buildings and offices should be placed relatively close to the street in order to promote visibility of store windows and to reduce the need for huge signs. Building setbacks may vary but principal buildings should be located within 40 feet of front property lines. The area between buildings and the street should be planted with a variety of trees, shrubs and perennial flowers.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.02)
Sec. 22-506. - Shared access road.
New commercial developments with frontage on State highways and County streets shall use shared access points to and from the highway. Normally, no more than 2 accesses are to be used per parcel or development (1 ingress, 1 egress, for example), regardless of the number of properties served.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.03)
Sec. 22-507. - Rear parking.
Parking lots are to be provided to the side or rear of non-residential buildings that are visible from public rights-of-way, with rear parking being preferred. Locate parking in front only if no other possibility exists and if parking is visually screened by landscaping and ground contours as described in section 22-515(a).
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.04)
Sec. 22-508. - Linked parking.
Parking lots on adjacent premises should be connected with access drives so that customers may drive from business to business.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.05)
Sec. 22-509. - Roadside trees.
Because roadside canopy shade trees are extremely important to the character of the County, removal of trees over 5 inches in caliper should be minimized within 50 feet of the edge of the road pavement. Removal of existing trees can usually be lessened by shifting the site of the building, parking lot, or the entrance/exit drive. If trees are removed, they are to be replaced with deciduous hardwoods and/or flowering ornamentals, such as listed in section 22-517(1), not including evergreens, at least 2 inches' caliper to the point of 1 every 35 feet (approximately). Where trees do not exist within 50 feet of the road pavement, new trees are to be planted approximately every 35 feet along the road to maintain rural character. Such trees are not required to be planted in a row, and should be deciduous hardwoods and flowering ornamentals, such as listed in section 22-517(1) and (5), not including evergreens, in order that a stately atmosphere of tall, leafy tree canopies may ultimately be created.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.06)
Sec. 22-510. - Rural landscape design elements.
Trees, shrubs, painted wood fences and rock walls are encouraged to maintain rural character and integrate the new construction into the rural landscape. Earth berms not to exceed 3 feet in height, and decorative metal fences are less attractive but may be useful for screening parking, loading or storage areas. Material such as chainlink and barbed wire are not to be used. Landscapes should use native or locally adaptable species and help blend the development with the surrounding countryside to the greatest extent practicable.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.07)
Sec. 22-511. - Compatible building designs.
Building placement, height, massing, roof shapes, window proportions and exterior materials should be compatible with the Battlefield area's historic architectural styles. The use of parapet walls is encouraged to give extra height to single-story buildings and help conceal roof equipment. No mechanical equipment should be mounted on roofs unless suitably screened or enclosed so as not to be visible from any property line or public road, using a material and architectural design compatible with the building on which it is located.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.08)
Sec. 22-512. - Sidewalks.
Sidewalks at least 5 feet wide shall be constructed to connect the development to adjoining properties. Six-foot-wide tree planting strips shall be provided between the road pavement and the sidewalk.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.09)
Sec. 22-513. - Storm drainage.
The runoff from parking and loading areas, buildings, and other impervious surfaces greater than 5,000 square feet shall be detained and treated in constructed wetlands or bio-retention areas (rain gardens) using engineered soil and aquatic grasses promoting natural filtering of pollutants and infiltration of stormwater into the ground. Stormwater management practices shall be followed such as those recommended by the Center for Watershed Protection, Ellicott City, MD (www.cwp.org) or as described in the Georgia Stormwater Manual (www.georgiastormwater.com).
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.10)
Sec. 22-514. - Landscaped buffers.
A landscaped buffer at least 50 feet wide shall be provided as a buffer when commercial properties abut residential districts. A landscaped buffer shall be thickly vegetated, with a width, length, and mixture of planting materials that is sufficient to visually screen the view of parked vehicles and loading spaces. See section 22-517 for planting standards. Such screening shall consist of mixture of evergreen and deciduous shade trees and shrubbery. In no case shall a structure or fence of any kind be erected within or along the exterior boundary of a buffer area.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.11)
Sec. 22-515. - Parking lot landscaping and screening standards.
(a)
Parking lots that face a street, or the U.S. Highway 27 when absolutely necessary, should be partially screened from the street by a low fence, wall, hedge, berm, or vegetated buffer. Such roadside screening should consist of a mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubbery. If a parking lot is of such a size that it dominates views from the fronting street and detracts from the overall streetscape and community appearance, then the parking lot should be screened or buffered with vegetation in its entirety from view along the fronting roadway(s) within the required right-of-way frontage planting strip: trees spaced no more than 35 feet apart, and a 6-foot-wide planting strip in which dense shrubs are trimmed at car-hood height.
(b)
Parking lots containing 10 or more spaces shall be planted with at least 1 overstory tree, or 2 understory trees, a minimum of 2-inch caliper, per 10 parking spaces; each tree being surrounded by no less than 64 square feet of permeable, unpaved area not less than 6 feet wide. Each landscape island is to be located in such a manner so as to divide and break up the expanse of parking areas (see Figure 14). One landscape island should be located at the end of each row of parking spaces in the interior of the parking lot. In addition, 1 parking lot landscape island should also be provided for every 150 linear feet of parking spaces, whether at the periphery or in the interior of the parking lot. Each landscape island should be of sufficient shape and size so that 1 overstory tree or 2 understory trees will fit within the island. No portion of an island should be less than 3 feet in width. The exterior ground area must include a minimum of 15 percent of that exterior ground area as a pervious surface. This may or may not be included as part of the parking lot.
Figure 14. Parking Lot Landscaped Island
(c)
Parking areas should be screened along their periphery when parking areas border institutional or residential uses. Adequate screening consists of a landscaped area at least 6 feet wide, densely planted with a mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs so as to create an effective visual barrier. All trees should be a minimum of 2-inch caliper when planted. The use of native trees and shrubs is strongly encouraged wherever possible (refer to section 22-517 for shrub and tree species).
(d)
In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, in part or in whole, the Planning Commission and/or DRB may adjust the application of these landscaping standards to allow credit for such plant material if, in its opinion, such an adjustment is in keeping with and will preserve the intent of these standards.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.12)
Sec. 22-516. - Selection of trees.
Use trees, shrubs and ground covers which have demonstrated survivability under the specific conditions of this region and of the planting site, and are non-invasive. A mixture of trees that would appear together in nature is encouraged. Select trees as appropriate for either shade, or seasonal color, or protection and nesting of birds and other wildlife.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.13)
Sec. 22-517. - Tree and shrub selection for roadsides, parking lots and yards.
Consult a local nursery, qualified arborist, or the agricultural extension office for assistance. Trees and shrubs used with success in this region are as follows:
(1)
Shade trees. Along roadsides and as interior and border trees in parking lots, use deciduous shade trees including Willow Oak, Tulip Poplar, Fastigiate English Oak Willamette, Yellowwood, Sawtooth Oak, Goldenrain Tree, Sourwood, Sweet Gum, Japanese Zelkova, Ginko (male plant) and River Birch.
(2)
Screening trees. For visual screening of parking lots and other areas, use evergreen trees including Leyland Cyprus, Foster Holly, American Holly, Southern Magnolia, Wax Myrtle, Canadian Hemlock, and Deodar Cedar.
(3)
Screening shrubs. For visual screening of parking lots and other areas, use evergreen shrubs including Japanese Aucuba, Wintergreen Barberry, Japanese Boxwood, Japanese Holly, Otto Luken Laurel and Frazer Photinia.
(4)
Low clearance trees. Beneath utility wires, consider tree-form Crape Myrtle or Stewartia.
(5)
Decorative trees. In parking lots and yards, use deciduous flowering trees for seasonal color, including Eastern Redbud, Flowering Dogwood, Yoshino Cherry, Red Maple and Lacebark Elm.
(6)
Decorative shrubs. In parking lots and yards, use flowering shrubs for seasonal color, including Glossy Abelia, Glenn Dale Azalea, Flowering Quince and Border Forsythia.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.14)
Sec. 22-518. - Signs.
(a)
Signs made of metal or wood are preferred over plastic signs.
(b)
The total area of façade signs shall not exceed 1 square foot per lineal foot of building width facing the street.
(c)
Freestanding signs along streets with speed limits of 40 miles per hour or less should be small, low monument-type signs (less than 5 feet high) integrated into the landscape using trees and shrubs.
(d)
Freestanding signs along highways with speed limits of 45 miles per hour or more should be less than 40 square feet in size and no more than 15 feet high.
(e)
Internally lighted signs should be used only with opaque backgrounds so that only lettering is visible at night.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.15)
Sec. 22-519. - Architectural design.
(a)
Architectural design shall be compatible with the character of the Chickamauga Chattanooga National Military Park community. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form size, color, materials, and detailing. The designer must consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process:
(1)
Size (the relationship of the project to its site);
(2)
Scale (the relationship of the building to those around it);
(3)
Massing (the relationship of the building's various parts to each other);
(4)
Fenestration (the placement of windows, doors, and other architectural details);
(5)
Rhythm (the relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections);
(6)
Setback (in relation to setback of immediate surroundings);
(7)
Materials (their compatibility with the historic district); and
(8)
Context (the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings).
(b)
Efforts must be made to coordinate the height of buildings with adjacent structures; this is especially applicable where buildings are located very close to each other. It is encouraged to adjust the height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line to match that of an adjacent or neighboring building. Similar design linkages, such as window lines, should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings. The maximum height of a building, at its highest point shall be 35 feet.
(c)
Themed or stylized architecture which is characteristic of the surrounding historic area is encouraged, with the intent of achieving architectural harmony.
(d)
Multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings.
(e)
Long or continuous wall planes shall be avoided, particularly in pedestrian activity areas, where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view.
(f)
Building surfaces over 50 feet in length should be relieved with changes of wall plane (i.e., recesses and projections, see Figure 15) that provide strong shadow or visual interest.
Figure 15. Recesses and Projections
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.16)
Sec. 22-520. - Building material, finishes, and colors.
(a)
All sides of a building may have an impact on its surroundings and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary natural materials (i.e., brick, wood and stone), unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used. Roadside and rear facades should be at least 80 percent brick and/or stone. Side facades should be at least 50 percent brick and/or stone. Secondary materials (i.e., stucco and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only. Alternatives to the above materials will be considered for approval by the DRB.
(b)
Exterior building materials on the primary structure should not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, prefabricated steel panels, plastic panels, or other non-natural materials.
(c)
The following types of building materials should not be used: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed plywood or particle board; and unplastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks, or exterior insulative finish systems.
(d)
Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided.
(e)
Facade colors should be low reflectance, and subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors should not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, provided that the width of the trim shall not exceed 4 feet.
(f)
Building colors should be carefully chosen so that each building color complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the base color (used on the majority of the building surface), trim color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and accent color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.
(g)
The use of awnings on buildings is recommended to provide much needed protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior. (See Figure 16.)
Figure 16. Awnings and Storefront Windows
(h)
It is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame, covered by a canvas or metal material. Awnings that are backlit through translucent materials must be approved by the DRB. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs. Canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be used. Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors complement the character of the structure or group of buildings.
(i)
Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face.
(j)
The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building and should use similar materials. All walls or fences 50 feet in length or longer, and 4 feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony by changing plane, height, material or material texture, or significant landscape massing. Chainlink, barbed wire, vinyl, and PVC fencing is not allowed. Use of special fencing design or materials should be discussed in cases where site security is paramount.
(k)
All garbage dumpsters and other similar areas devoted to the storage of waste material should be screened on 3 sides of said dumpster or area, with a minimum 6-foot-high solid wooden fence or a wall constructed of materials substantially similar in appearance to the building on site. In addition, said dumpster areas should be gated on the fourth side with a material that provides opaque screening.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 3.17)
Sec. 22-521. - Exterior lighting.
(a)
Exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material, and colors.
(b)
Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site, and the light source is shielded from direct off-site viewing. All outdoor light fixtures should be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate uplighting, spill light, and glare.
(c)
Excessive illumination of signage, building, or site should be avoided. Roof lighting, down-lighting washing the building walls, and illuminated awnings are all strongly discouraged.
(d)
Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. The mounting height of fixtures in smaller parking lots or service areas should not exceed 20 feet, with lower mounting heights encouraged, particularly where adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses. Use of low, bollard-type fixtures that are 3 to 4 feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting.
(e)
Select lighting layouts and fixtures that minimize glare, light trespass, shadows, excessive light levels, skyglow and inaccurate color rendition. The techniques listed below are those that enable good vision, safety, and a sense of security at night while, at the same time, create an attractive appearance, protect neighbors' property values, and maintain the County's rural character.
(f)
To minimize glare, and light trespass onto neighbors' properties or public rights-of-way:
(1)
For flood lights and flood lamps, aim fixtures down at least 60 degrees from vertical. For fixtures installed less than 60 degrees down from vertical, use shields, cut-offs, visors, reflectors, louvers, or other devices such that no portion of the light bulb or lens extends below the bottom edge of the external shield. Where flood lights and display lights are installed within 50 feet of a public street right-of-way, aim fixtures and install shields, louvers and/or other devices to prevent any lamp or lens from being visible from off the property.
(2)
For wall-mounted lighting fixtures and pole mounted open-bottom security lighting fixtures, select full cut-off or fully shielded fixtures in which the light source is not directly visible from beyond the property line.
(3)
For yard and parking lot lighting fixtures other than flood lamps and flood lights, select either cutoff fixtures or use fixtures with lamps that do not exceed 9,500 initial lamp lumens (equal to 100-watt high pressure sodium lamp).
(4)
The mounting height of outdoor lighting for parking lots, outdoor areas and outdoor sales and display areas should not exceed 37 feet above finished grade.
(g)
Avoid excessive light levels that waste energy and money, and create disabling glare. Studies show that brighter light does not always allow the best viewing, for it creates very dark shadows on the fringe of the lighted area to which the eye does not easily adjust. Experiment with low wattage bulbs, and use shielded lights that use visors or reflectors to direct light onto the intended area instead of wasting some of it, to save energy and money and prevent glare.
(h)
Avoid contributing to skyglow by using dark pavements with low reflectivity when feasible (i.e., asphalt instead of concrete), instead of reflective surfaces that reflect light upwards into the night sky.
(i)
For accurate nighttime color rendition, use bulbs that give a white light such as incandescent, compact fluorescent, metal halide or quartz. When color accuracy is not important, use low-pressure sodium (LPS) bulbs that are low cost to buy and operate.
(j)
Gas station/convenience store aprons and canopies should be lighted to provide adequate security but should not be over-lighted. Areas under canopies should have a horizontal luminance not greater than 24 footcandles at grade, and fixtures should be either recessed in the underside of the canopy or fully cutoff to not create glare off-site.
(k)
Lighted outdoor advertising off-premises signs should be switched off between the hours 11:30 p.m. and the following sunset.
(l)
Outdoor lights should be on timers to switch off 30 minutes after the business or operation closes, leaving only security and safety lights.
(m)
Except for buildings of exceptional symbolic significance (e.g., churches and public buildings) or of historic significance, exterior building fronts should not be illuminated.
(n)
Illuminating signs are to be internal or top mounted and directed downwards.
(o)
Searchlights, laser lights, flashing, moving, revolving, flickering, or strobe lights, or any lights that change intensity or color, are prohibited.

Secs. 22-522—22-550. - Reserved.
DIVISION 4. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

Sec. 22-551. - Noise.
Excessive noise should be muffled so as not to be objectionable due to intermittence, beat frequency, shrillness, or volume.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 4.01)
Sec. 22-552. - Outdoor storage area screening.
(a)
Outdoor areas used for the storage and collection of rubbish, are to be visually screened from roads and surrounding land uses. Suitable types of screening include opaque wood fences and dense evergreen hedges of 5 feet or more in height. Where evergreen hedges are proposed, a temporary fence should be built to provide screening until the evergreens are of sufficient height.
(b)
In locations where potential health or safety hazards may arise (such as rubbish storage/collection areas), a solid wooden fence, 6 feet in height is to be constructed (to deter children and animals from entering the premises).
(c)
Where new fencing would create a continuous surface greater than 10 feet in length, it should be softened visually with tree and shrub plantings.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 4.02)
Sec. 22-553. - Automobile related establishments.
(a)
Auto service facilities should not have their fuel pumps facing U.S. Highway 27, and parking for all uses should be located to the side or rear of the building rather than in the front, with rear parking strongly preferred.
(b)
Service areas shall provide adequate queuing space that does not impede vehicle circulation through the site or result in vehicles stacking into the street.
(c)
Perimeter and security fencing, when needed, should be constructed of attractive materials that are compatible with the design and materials used throughout the project.
(d)
Fencing design materials such as chainlink, razor wire or electric fencing may not be used.
(e)
Separate structures on the site (i.e., canopy, cashier's booth, car washes, etc.) should have consistent architectural detail and design elements to provide a cohesive project site. If a car wash is incorporated into the project, it should be well integrated into the design. The car wash opening should be sited so that it is not directly visible as the primary view from U.S. Highway 27 into the project site.
(f)
The outside storage or display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold, including manufactured home sales, shall not be permitted in the Corridor.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 4.03)

DIVISION 6. - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 22-611. - Applicability.
Notwithstanding other land development regulations to the contrary, this Conservation Subdivision option is mandatory as a use by right in all Residential developments within the Corridor Overlay district. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the Walker County Land Development Regulations except those that are incompatible with provisions contained herein or with other applicable laws. See article VI of this chapter.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.01)
Sec. 22-612. - General conformance.
Proposed residential developments within the Corridor Overlay district shall conform to all regulations in all sections of the Walker County Building Code except that, in cases of conflict, provisions stated in this division supersede conflicting provisions of other sections of this division.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.02)
Sec. 22-613. - Purpose and intent.
The intent of this division is to provide standards for development of residential subdivisions within the Corridor Overlay District, by providing flexibility of design in order to provide and preserve open space, while accommodating the amount of development that otherwise would not be legally possible under conventional subdivision designs, and that:
(1)
Preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(2)
Preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
(3)
Permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(4)
Reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
(5)
Provide areas of open space accessed and utilized by residents of conservation developments for passive and/or active recreation.
(6)
Contribute to an interconnected network of permanent open space in the County.
(7)
Promote undivided open spaces within, and between, new developments.
(8)
Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing neighborhood gathering places and encouraging use of open space, play areas and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
(9)
Encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reduce reliance on arterial roads.
(10)
Conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(11)
Protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.03)
Sec. 22-614. - Land use regulations.
Land in the Conservation Subdivision may be used for:
(1)
Single-family detached dwellings with or without Home Occupations and/or accessory dwelling units.
(2)
Open space, as defined herein, composing a portion of a residential development.
(3)
Municipal or public uses, public park, or recreation area owned and operated by a public or private nonprofit agency not to include storage of materials, trucking or repair facilities, the housing of repair crews, or sanitary landfills.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.04)
Sec. 22-615. - Minimum subdivision acreage.
The site proposed for a Conservation Subdivision must contain an area of 5 acres or more, unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission due to special and unusual circumstances such as location along a potential greenway corridor or riparian buffer where linkage is essential.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.05)
Sec. 22-616. - Retaining rural residential character.
(a)
Where possible, barns and other agricultural outbuildings in reasonably good condition and which contribute to the rural character of the area shall be retained on the site (see Figure 18).
Figure 18. Retention of Agricultural Structures
(b)
Dwellings and driveways shall not be prominent visual features within the landscape along any existing rural road. Dwellings and associated outbuildings along existing rural roads should have a low visual impact. When a rural residential dwelling is proposed in an area with an open field or area with agricultural character, it should be sited at the edge of the field if possible to preserve the view of the open field, pasture, or agricultural scene (see Figure 19).
Figure 19. Site Dwellings at Edges of Fields
(c)
In siting rural residential dwellings, gouging out (i.e., clearcutting) building sites along the road (Figure 20) is unacceptable. Instead, rural dwelling sites shall leave a natural buffer along the road and houses should be sited at the edge of clearings rather than in the center (Figure 21).
Figure 20. Clearcutting Discouraged
Figure 21. Dwellings Buffered
(d)
Dwellings shall not be sited within an open field. (See area A in Figure 22.) The location of dwellings in Area B of the illustration improves on the locations shown in area A, but the residences are still visible from the road. In the bottom part of area C (Figure 22), dwellings are clustered and screened from view. In the top part of area C, the road should be located at the edge of the clearing rather than in the middle of the field, and the dwellings should be located closer to the tree line.
Figure 22. Siting Dwellings in Rural Areas
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.06)
Sec. 22-617. - Authority of Health Department.
Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as preventing the Health Department from adopting additional or more stringent requirements governing subdivision development.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.07)
Sec. 22-618. - Ownership.
The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership; however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.08)
Sec. 22-619. - Prioritized list of alternative wastewater systems.
The selection of wastewater treatment technique shall be based upon the following prioritized list of preferred wastewater treatment options:

(3)
On-site individual septic system if the above options are not feasible for any reason.
(4)
Off-lot individual septic system, if an on-site alternative acceptable to the local Health Department is not feasible, or if the off-lot arrangement can be demonstrated to be equal to or superior to the on-site alternative due to the configuration of soil quality on the tract.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.09)
Sec. 22-620. - Density determination.
The maximum number of lots in the Conservation Subdivision shall be determined by either of the following 2 methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
(1)
Calculation method. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in either the underlying zoning or local Health Department standards, whichever is greater. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
The 100-year flood hazard zone.
b.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
c.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
d.
50 percent of land with slopes greater than 25 percent, of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
e.
Street and utility rights-of-way.
f.
Land within the right-of-way of high tension electrical transmission lines 69 KV or greater.
g.
Any other land that is not otherwise eligible for building.
(2)
Yield plan method. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. This plan need not meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be economically feasible and capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations. At its discretion, the Planning Director may require applicant to submit soils samples from 10 percent of lots to verify soils suitability. Such lots shall be selected by Planning Office, as being the most questionable lots on the property.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.10)
Sec. 22-621. - Discretionary density incentives and disincentives.
(a)
Where subdivisions are proposed on land in the Corridor Overlay, Planning Commission may allow additions or deductions in density in order to encourage the use of Conservation Subdivision layouts with permanently protected open space that exceed the 50 percent minimum requirement.
(b)
For subdivision layouts that have 50 percent open space as defined in article VI of this chapter, the full density computed in accordance with article VI of this chapter is allowed.
(c)
For subdivision layouts on designated environmentally sensitive or historic land that have 60 percent open space as defined in article VI of this chapter, the density computed in accordance with article VI of this chapter shall be increased by 25 percent.
(d)
For subdivision layouts on designated environmentally sensitive or historic land that have no open space as defined in article VI of this chapter, the density computed in accordance with article VI of this chapter shall be decreased by 50 percent.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.11)
Sec. 22-622. - Dimensional standards.
In order to enable clustered housing on small lots, there shall be no limitation on lot size, lot width or setbacks.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 6.12)
Sec. 22-623. - Minimum lot sizes specified by the Health Department.
Requirements for minimum lot sizes specified by the Health Department remain applicable. At applicant's option, subject to approval of Health Department, minimum lot size requirements of the Health Department may include the sum of:
(1)
The house lot; and
(2)
Land in the open space parcel used for any component of an individually-owned septic absorption facility or replacement area.

Sec. 22-637. - Residential development design guidelines.
(a)
Street design. All streets shall be constructed in accordance with the Walker County Subdivision Regulations with the exception that the minimum street right-of-way for streets shall be 40 feet, the minimum pavement width for streets shall be 20 feet, and a shallow, open drainage swale may be used in lieu of curbs and gutters.
(b)
Street layout. No subdivision shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
(c)
Street trees. Street trees shall be provided within the street rights-of-way parallel with the street at a maximum spacing of 30 feet apart if the total canopy of trees within the open space is less than 20 percent of the total tract acreage. Trees shall be deciduous, broad canopied trees capable of attaining a height of at least 50 feet (see section 22-517 for tree selection). Trees shall be maintained for 1 year and replaced if they die.
(d)
Sidewalks. Sidewalks of at least 4 feet in width shall be required with a 2-foot-wide vegetation strip between the road pavement and the sidewalk.
(e)
Outdoor lighting. Street lighting in rural subdivisions is discouraged. Any light fixture that uses a light source greater than 1,500 initial lumens (equal to 120 watts for incandescent flood bulbs) for lighting of streets, entrance signs, sidewalks, landscaping, alleys, playgrounds, sales office exteriors, common facilities, or for security lighting, shall be either full cut-off or cut-off type as defined by the Illuminating Society of North America (IESNA), to prevent glare. In addition:
(1)
Light from any such fixture shall be directed downwards rather than upwards and outwards, with no more than 5 percent of light directed above a horizontal plane through the center of the lamp.
(2)
If necessary, fixtures may include house-side shields to minimize light directed to the rear of fixtures.
(3)
No line of sight of a bulb or lens is permitted from an adjacent property or from house lots within the subdivision.
(4)
Lamp choices shall be only metal halide, fluorescent, incandescent or quartz in order to achieve accurate nighttime color rendition.

(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 7.02)
Sec. 22-665. - Health Department review of sketch plan.
For proposed developments not intended to be served by public sewer and/or public water, the applicant shall request and attend an informal sketch plan meeting with the local Health Department. The applicant should bring to this meeting a Level 3 Soil Study in addition to the sketch plan and a concept for wastewater treatment.
(Ord. of 5-19-2005, § 7.03)
Sec. 22-666. - Four-step design process.
All preliminary plans shall include documentation that a 4-step design process was followed in determining the layout of the proposed open space, house sites, streets and lot lines, as described below. Applicants shall be prepared to submit 4 separate sketch maps indicating the findings of each of the following steps of the design process, if requested by the Planning Director or Planning Commission.
(1)
Step 1; delineation of open space. Percentages and acreages shall be calculated in accordance with these regulations, and shall be designated using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map as a base map and complying with article VI of this chapter.
(2)
Step 2; location of house sites. Using proposed open space lands as a base map, as well as other relevant data from the site analysis map such as topography and soils, locate potential house sites. House sites should generally be located no closer than 100 feet from Primary Conservation Areas and 50 feet from Secondary Conservation Areas.
(3)
Step 3; alignment of streets. Upon designating house sites, following topography and other natural features, design a street plan that minimizes impacts on proposed open space. Street layouts should generally minimize use of cul-de-sacs, and should maximize current or future access to and from adjoining parcels.
(4)
Step 4; drawing in lot lines. Draw lot lines delineating boundaries of individual residential lots.
