The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(e)
Where effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the city. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent. When deriving alternative categorical limits, the city shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards and an alternative consecutive sampling daily average value using the monthly average values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards. The industrial user shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the city until the city modifies the limits or approves an industrial user modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An industrial user must immediately report any such material or significant change to the control authority. Where appropriate, new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within 30 days. Alternative limits shall be calculated according to 40 CFR 403.6(e)(i).

(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 6)
Sec. 82-127. - Surcharges.
(a)
Basis for establishing. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following:
(1)
Water or wastes having a monthly average five-day biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 parts per million on a 24-hour composite basis.
(2)
Water or wastes having a monthly average suspended solid content in excess of 300 parts per million on a 24-hour composite basis.
The amount of the surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess BOD and TSS. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the water pollution control facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(b)
Formula determining surcharge. When any or all the BOD and TSS of wastewater or waste accepted for admission to the city's water pollution control facilities exceeds the values of the constituents set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations of any or all, as the case may be, shall be evaluated in terms of these values and shall be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula:
Amount of surcharge = (B + C) × Effluent flow (CCF)
Where:
EXPAND
B = The cost factor for TSS discharged to the sewer above 300 ppm. This quantity is determined by the multiplication of a factor (X) by the excessive pounds of TSS in the wastewater as measured in samples collected so as to be representative of the daily wastewater discharge
C = The cost factor for BOD discharged to the sewer above 300 ppm. This quantity is determined by the multiplication of a factor (Y) by the excessive pounds of BOD in the wastewater as measured in samples collected so as to be representative of the daily wastewater discharge
X = The annual average cost of removal of one pound of TSS
Y = The annual average cost of removal of one pound of BOD
  (c)
Determination of amounts. The rates of surcharge for each of the constituents mentioned in this section shall be determined annually by the city in order that the factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. A schedule of the surcharge shall be on file with the city.

1.
Identify the categorical pretreatment standard applicable to each regulated process.
2.
Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration and mass, where required by the standard or by the city, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and longterm average concentrations or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 82-134.
e.
Flow measurements. The industrial user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow in gallons per day to the publicly owned treatment works from each of the following:
1.
Regulated process stream; and
2.
Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
f.
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standard and requirements.
g.
Compliance schedule.
1.
If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standard, the industrial user shall submit the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standards.
2.
A compliance schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operations). No increments referred to shall exceed nine months.
3.
The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date for compliance, including at a minimum whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, if not the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city.
(c)
Ninety-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, for a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the publicly owned treatment works, any industrial users subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsection (b) of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharges per unit of production or other measure of operation, this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified.
(d)
Periodic compliance reports.
(1)
Any significant categorical or noncategorical industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the city, but in no case less than twice per year in June and December, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified.
(2)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3)
If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutants more frequently than required by the publicly owned treatment works, using the procedures specified in 40 CFR 136, the result of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(4)
Any person signing periodic compliance reports submitted pursuant to this subsection shall make the following certification:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."
(e)
Notice of significant changes. Each industrial user is required promptly to notify the city in advance of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might significantly alter the nature or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
(1)
The city may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application.
(2)
The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit, modify an existing wastewater discharge permit, condition a wastewater discharge permit, or deny a wastewater discharge permit.
(3)
No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions covered by this subsection until and unless the city has responded to the industrial user's notice.
(4)
If an existing industrial user governed by the national categorical standards adds or changes a process or operation which may be included in a subcategory, the existing industrial user must make an application for certification prior to commencing discharge from the added or changed processes or operation. A new source must request this certification prior to commencing discharge.
(f)
Reporting potential problems.
(1)
For any discharge, including but not limited to accidental discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the publicly owned treatment works, including a violation of the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective action taken by the industrial user.
(2)
Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the publicly owned treatment works, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or applicable state or federal law.
(3)
Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article.
(4)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call for a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(g)
Notice of the bypass.
(1)
If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit written notification to the city at least ten days in advance and receive approval prior to the bypass.
(2)
An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass to the city within one hour from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
(3)
A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain the following:
a.
Cause and description of the bypass.
b.
Exact dates and times of the bypass.
c.
If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
(h)
Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is generally prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against the industrial user for a bypass. The city may approve a bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines the following:
(1)
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the cessation of production or operation, operational changes to reduce the impact or duration of the bypass, the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass.
(3)
The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (g) of this section.
(i)
Hazardous waste notification.
(1)
Any industrial user shall notify the publicly owned treatment works, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the publicly owned treatment works of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the Environmental Protection Agency hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the publicly owned treatment works, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notifications under this subsection need to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements.
(2)
Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which industrial users discharge no more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes. Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
For any new regulations under section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substances as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the publicly owned treatment works, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
For any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
This subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued under this article, or any applicable federal or state law.
(j)
Accidental discharge/slug control plan. The city may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years the city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user required to do so shall submit a plan which addresses, at minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.
(2)
Description of stored chemicals.
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the publicly owned treatment works of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge that would violate section 82-123 regarding discharges prohibited by this article.
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from accidental spills or slug discharges. Such procedures must include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants including solvents, and measures and equipment for emergency response.
(k)
Date of submission of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(l)
Retention of records. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records and information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date; the exact place, method, and time of sampling; the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city.
(m)
Confidentiality. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. When requested by the person furnishing a report and approved by the city, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, the state disposal system permit and the pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 12)
Sec. 82-133. - Removal, transportation and disposition of scavenger wastes.
(a)
The city may require a permit for the discharge of scavenger wastes after submission of an application on forms supplied by the city. All other materials and substances, chemical or chemical compounds and industrial wastes will not be permitted to be discharged into the public sewer system except as provided in this article.
(b)
The discharge of the wastes in subsection (a) of this section shall be made only at a location in the sewage treatment plant as shall be designated by the city.
(c)
Scavenger wastes will be admitted into the sewer system only by permit and subject to payment of a fee which may be set by the mayor and council from time to time, a schedule of which is available in the office of the city clerk.
(d)
The applicant shall be the owner of the vehicle discharging the wastes.
(e)
Prior to discharging any scavenger wastes, the applicant shall be required to file a statement identifying the exact location of the waste source of each load discharged. Any false, misleading or untruthful statement as to the nature or source of the material shall be cause for rejection of any further discharge from the applicant. Discharges may also be suspended or terminated at any time by the city for the willful, continued or persistent violation of this article.
(f)
All equipment, such as trucks, tanks, pumps, and hoses, used in the collection and transportation of scavenger wastes shall be modern equipment in good repair. When more than one vehicle is used by an applicant, each vehicle shall bear an identifying number.
(g)
Every applicant for a permit shall furnish the following information with each application:
(1)
Name and address of the applicant;
(2)
Volume of scavenger waste for each numbered vehicle; and
(3)
Number of scavenger vehicles in collection service.
(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 13)
Sec. 82-134. - Measurements, tests and analyses.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and waste to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 136 and shall be determined at the control manholes provided or upon suitable samples taken at the control manholes. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer at the point where the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewer works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH measurements are determined from periodic grab samples.

When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, the wastewater discharge permits or orders issued under this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified period. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. The compliance order may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, and a compliance order does not release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any action against the user.
(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. VII, § 8)
Sec. 82-169. - Cease and desist order.
(a)
When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued under this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
(b)
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. VII, § 9)
Sec. 82-170. - Suspension of discharge.
(a)
Under this article, the city may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the publicly owned treatment works or which presents or may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment.
(b)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the publicly owned treatment works, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in section 82-171 are initiated against the user.
(c)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city, prior to the date of any show cause order of termination hearing under sections 82-165 and 82-171. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. VII, § 10)
Sec. 82-171. - Termination of discharge.
(a)
Any user that violates the following conditions of this article, the wastewater discharge permits, or orders issue under this article is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge.
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in this article.
(b)
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 82-165 as to why the proposed action should not be taken.

Sec. 82-202. - Purpose; investigations of noncompliance.
The city is putting this enforcement response plan in place to alert all industrial users of possible actions which may be taken for noncompliance. The city will investigate instances of noncompliance by increasing publicly owned treatment works inspections, surveillance, and monitoring activities. Additionally, the publicly owned treatment works will request the user to resample to verify the measured effluent parameters are back into compliance.
(Ord. of 9-9-1996)
Sec. 82-203. - Publication of list of users in significant noncompliance.

Sec. 82-205. - Use of enforcement response guide.
The following guidelines are for the use of the enforcement response guide in this section:
(1)
Locate the type of noncompliance in the first column and identify the most accurate description of the violation.
(2)
Assess the appropriateness of the recommended responses in column two. First-time offenders or users demonstrating good faith effort may merit a more lenient response. Similarly, repeat offenders or those demonstrating negligence may require a more stringent response.
(3)
Apply the enforcement response plan to the industrial user. Specify corrective action or other responses required of the industrial user, if any. Column three indicates personnel to take each response. The timeframe for each response is listed following the enforcement response guide.
(4)
Follow up with escalated enforcement action if the industrial user's response is not received or violation continues.
