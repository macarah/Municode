All materials, equipment, supplies and contractual services, when the estimated cost thereof shall exceed the amount as established by the city council, shall be presented to the mayor and council for formal action.

Notices, at the discretion of the purchasing agent, inviting bids shall be published once in at least one official newspaper in the city at least five days preceding the last day for the receipt of proposals.

b.
The purchasing agent also shall solicit bids from all prospective vendors and contractors by mailing them copies of bids with the necessary specifications, and any other information which will acquaint them with the proposed purchases.

When deemed necessary by the purchasing agent, bid deposits shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. The amounts of such deposits shall be five percent of the bids and shall be in the form of a bond or certified check. Bonds and certified checks shall be returned to unsuccessful bidders within five days after the awarding of the contracts. The successful bidder shall forfeit any deposit required upon failure on his part to enter into a contract within 15 days after the award.
d.
Bids shall be sealed, shall be identified on the envelope, shall be submitted at the place and no later than the time stated in the public notice inviting bids and shall be opened at a public meeting at the time and place stated in the public notice. A tabulation of all bids received shall be made available for public inspection.

When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for placing the contract elsewhere shall be placed in the minutes of the council meeting following the award.

If all bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality being equal, the contract shall be awarded to a local bidder. When the decision can be made in no other way, the contract shall be awarded to one of the tie bidders by drawing lots in public.
(d)
Public works project exception. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to change, reduce or otherwise alter the provisions of state law governing the requirements of performance and payment bonds for public works accomplished in this city. Presently, the requirement of such bonds, under state law, is for all contracts of improvements exceeding $100,000.00. The provisions of O.C.G.A. § 13-10-1 are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this subsection. Hereafter, the requirements of state law (and any later amendments thereto) shall govern the purchasing agent's requirements of performance and payment bonds pursuant to this article.
(e)
Performance bonds. To protect the interests of the city, a performance bond in the amount of 100 percent of the proposed contract shall be required from the successful bidder before entering into the contract. If such bond is not provided within 15 days of the award of such bid, the award shall be void. The contractor shall furnish such other bonds or insurances as may be required by law, the city or specifications. The amounts and types of these bonds and insurances shall be set forth in the bid specifications.

Day-to-day and emergency purchases.

The heads of such departments shall follow normal purchasing procedures as defined in the purchasing procedures policy.
(i)
Petty cash fund. The purchasing agent is hereby authorized to establish a petty cash fund not to exceed $250.00, it being recognized that such fund eliminates the writing of numerous requisitions and purchase orders, thereby resulting in a saving of appreciable time, supplies and money. Such fund shall be used primarily for the purchase of small items needed at once, and only upon the approval of the purchasing agent. In order to reimburse the petty cash fund, the purchasing agent shall submit to the city clerk a petty cash voucher form, in duplicate, and attach all receipts as a means of accounting for its expenses.
(j)
