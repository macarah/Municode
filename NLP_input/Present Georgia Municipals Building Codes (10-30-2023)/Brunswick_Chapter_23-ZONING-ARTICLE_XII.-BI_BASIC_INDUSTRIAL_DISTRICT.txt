ARTICLE XII. - BI BASIC INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-12-1. - Intent of district.
It is the intent of this section that the BI zoning district be developed and reserved for basic or primary types of industrial uses which involve extensive manufacturing, processing or assembly operations and/or serve as large employment centers. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a compatible environment for industries which require sizable tracts of land and/or employ large numbers of workers, protect and reserve undeveloped areas in Glynn County which are suitable for such industries and to discourage any encroachment by residential, commercial or other uses capable of adversely affecting the basic industrial character of the district.
