VI. - TRENCH EXCAVATION, BACKFILL AND COMPACTION
PART 1 - GENERAL

1.1 - SCOPE
Work under this section shall apply to furnishing all materials, equipment and labor for excavation, trenching and backfilling for utility systems. "Utility system" shall include underground piping and appurtenances for water distribution systems, storm water drains, and sewer collection systems.
1.2 - EXISTING UTILITIES
A.
Before opening trenches, the Contractor shall examine all available records and explore for the location of all subsurface pipes, valves or other structures and reference such locations on the surface. (CALL BEFORE YOU DIG! Utilities Protection Center: 1-800-282-7411)
B.
In opening trenches, every effort shall be made not to interfere with these utilities structures. Expose existing piping by hand before excavating by machine. Excavate existing utilities sufficiently in advance of pipe laying to determine crossing arrangement. Slight deviations may be permitted in order to clear such structures. The Contractor shall be entirely responsible for the preservation of all underground or overhead utility lines and structures, such as gas, water, sewer lines, telephone conduit, power lines, etc., and shall replace, adjust or repair, without cost to the City, any such lines damaged or interfered with as a result of their construction.
C.
Schedule work to keep roads and utilities in useable condition; coordinating all operation with the City of Kingsland to avoid inconvenience insofar as practicable.
1.3 - EXCAVATED MATERIAL
All material to be excavated shall be classified as earth.
1.4 - QUALITY ASSURANCE
A.
All excavation within the rights-of-way of City streets and County, State or Federal roadways, shall be backfilled in accordance with the then prevailing requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation, Highway Division.
B.
Reference Standards: Methods of Sampling and Testing of American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
PART 2 - EXECUTION

2.1 - GENERAL EXCAVATION
A.
The Contractor shall do all excavation of whatever substances encountered to depth shown on plans. Excavated materials not required for fill or backfill shall be removed from the site as directed by the engineer.
B.
Contractor is to provide three (3) foot minimum ground cover over utility.
C.
Excavation for manholes and other accessories to have 12 inches minimum and 24 inches maximum clearance on all sides.
D.
Excavation shall not be carried below the required level.
E.
Where excavation is carried below grades indicated, the contractor shall refill same to the proper grade with compacted earth, or as directed by the design engineer or City Inspector.
F.
Banks of trenches shall be vertical unless soil conditions pose danger to personnel or material or conflict with OSHA regulations, in which case the latter will take precedence.
G.
Width of trench shall be 6-inch minimum, 8-inch maximum, on each side of the pipe bell. The bottom of trench for sewers and culverts shall be rounded so that an arc of the circumference equal to 0.6 of the outside diameter of the pipe rests on undisturbed soil.
H.
Bell holes shall be excavated accurately to size by hand.
2.2 - UNSUITABLE BEARING MATERIALS
Should unsuitable bearing materials be encountered at levels indicated and found to have insufficient bearing values, the City Inspector may order the excavation carried to lower depths.
2.3 - PIPE BEDDING
A.
The contact between a pipe and the foundation on which it rests is the pipe bedding.
B.
Classes of Bedding: Four (4) classes of bedding to be used for pipes in trenches are described as follows:
1.
Class A - Concrete Cradle or Concrete Arch Bedding: This class of bedding may take either of two forms.
a.
Concrete Cradle - The pipe shall be bedded in a monolithic cradle of plain or reinforced concrete having a minimum thickness of 1/4 the inside pipe diameter or a minimum of 4 inches under the barrel and extending up the sides for a height equal to 1/4 the outside diameter. The cradle shall have a width at least equal to the outside diameter of the pipe barrel plus 8 inches. Backfill above the cradle and extending to 12 inches above the crown of the pipe shall be compacted carefully.
b.
Concrete Arch - The pipe shall be embedded in a carefully compacted granular material having a minimum thickness of 1/4 the outside diameter between barrel and bottom of trench excavation and extending halfway up the sides of the pipe. The top half of the pipe shall be covered with a monolithic plain or reinforced concrete arch having a minimum thickness of 1/4 the inside diameter at the crown and having a minimum width equal to the outside pipe diameter plus 8 inches.
2.
Class B - First Class Bedding - Class B bedding may be achieved by either of two construction methods.
a.
Shaped Bottom with Tamped Backfill. The bottom of the trench excavation shall be shaped to conform to a cylindrical surface with a radius at least 2 inches greater than the radius to the outside of the pipe and with a width sufficient to allow 3/5 of the width of the pipe barrel to be bedded in fine granular fill placed in the shaped excavation. Carefully compacted backfill shall be placed at the sides of the pipe to a thickness of at least 12 inches above the top of the pipe. Shaped trench bottoms shall be used only with the approval of the City Inspector.
b.
Compacted Granular Bedding with Tamped Backfill. The pipe shall be bedded in compacted granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. The granular bedding shall have a minimum thickness of 1/4 the outside pipe diameter and shall extend halfway up the pipe barrel at the sides. The remainder of the side fills and a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of the pipe shall be filled with carefully compacted material.
3.
Class C - Ordinary Bedding: Class C ordinary bedding may be achieved by either of two methods:
a.
Shaped Bottom. The pipe shall be bedded with "ordinary" care in an earth foundation formed in the trench bottom by a shaped excavation which will fit the pipe barrel with reasonable closeness for a width of at least 50% of the outside pipe diameter. The side fills and area over the pipe to a minimum depth of 6 inches above the top of the pipe shall be filled with lightly compacted fill. The shaped bottom bedding shall be used only with the approval of the City Inspector.
b.
Compacted Granular Bedding with a Tamped Backfill. The pipe shall be bedded in compacted granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. The granular bedding shall have a minimum thickness of 4 inches under the barrel and shall extend 1/10 to 1/6 of the outside diameter up the pipe barrel at the sides. The remainder of the side fills and to a minimum depth of 6 inches over the tip of the pipe shall be filled with lightly compacted backfill.
4.
Granular pipe bedding material shall be well graded crushed stone or crushed gravel meeting the requirements of ASTM C33, Gradation 67 (3/4 inch to No. 4). A well graded gravel meeting these same requirements can also be used.
5.
Where ledge rock, compact rocky or gravely soil, or other unyielding foundation material is encountered, the pipes shall be bedded in accordance with the following additions: The hard unyielding material shall be excavated to the elevation of the bottom of the concrete cradle (Class A bedding) or below the bottom of the pipe and the pipe bell (Class B, C or D bedding), to a depth of at least 6 inches (15 cm). The width of the excavation shall be at least 5/4 the outside diameter of the pipe and it shall be refilled with granular material.
2.4 - BRACING AND SHORING
A.
The Contractor shall do all bracing, sheeting and shoring necessary to perform and protect all excavations as required for safety.
B.
All bracing, sheeting and shoring shall be performed in accordance with the Standard Excavation and Grading Code, most recent edition, as produced and published by the Southern Building Code Congress International.
2.5 - DEWATERING FOR EXCAVATION
A.
The Contractor shall pump or remove any water accumulated in any excavation area and shall perform all work necessary to keep excavations clear of water while foundations, structures or any masonry are being constructed or while pipe is being laid.
B.
No structure or pipe shall be laid in water, and water shall not be allowed to flow over or rise upon any concrete, masonry, or piping until same has been inspected and the mortar or joint material has cured.
C.
No extra compensation will be allowed for removal of water.
D.
All water pumped or bailed from the trenches or other excavation shall be conveyed in a manner to a point of discharge where it will neither cause a hazard to the public health, nor damage to the public or private property, or to work completed or in progress.
2.6 - BACKFILL
A.
The soil at the sides of a pipe and above it is the backfill.
B.
Prior to backfilling any excavation, all piping and structures shall be observed by the City Site Development Inspector if he so desires.
C.
After pipes have been tested and approved, backfilling shall be done with approved material free from large clods or stones.
D.
Backfill shall be placed in uniform layers, four inches thick, on both sides of the pipe and thoroughly compacted with pneumatic or hand tampers. The backfill shall be brought up uniformly on both sides of the pipe and compacted to an elevation of one foot above the top of the pipe, after which the fill shall be placed in eight-inch lifts.
1.
Backfill shall be compacted to not less than 95% of the maximum dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 (Standard Proctor Test).
2.
The top 18 inches of backfill under any paved area shall be compacted to 100% Standard Proctor.
3.
Water settling will not be permitted in clay soils. It may be required at the option of the City Inspector in sandy soils.
2.7 - REPLACING PAVEMENTS
A.
Subgrades shall be compacted with a mechanical tamper.
B.
Concrete pavement to be replaced in accordance with Section III Part 3.4-B-1, "Concrete Pavement Replacement."
