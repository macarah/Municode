704.01 - Rules governing interpretation.
Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on said map, the following rules shall apply:
A.
Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center line right-of-way of streets and alleys, land lot lines, militia district lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
B.
Where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on such maps. Split zoned properties shall no longer be permitted, however, those existing on the date of adoption of this article shall be allowed to continue as a nonconforming use. Property owners may request the City rezone the entire property to one of the existing zonings or subdivide the property along the district boundary provided all lot standards are achieved for each newly created lot.
C.
Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this article, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
