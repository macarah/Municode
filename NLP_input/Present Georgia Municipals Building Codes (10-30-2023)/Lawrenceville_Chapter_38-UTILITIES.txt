An approved air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel, in no case less than one inch (2.54 centimeters).
Auxiliary water supply. Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source, such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These natural waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution pipes of the potable supply of water from any source. See Backsiphonage and Backpressure.
Backflow preventer means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.
Backflow prevention by containment program refers to the manual attached to the ordinance from which this section was derived, and incorporated in this section, to be used as the most comprehensive statement of the rules and regulations to be followed by the Water Department and others whose activities fall within the scope of this article.
Backpressure means any elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (by pump, elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the supply pressure at the point of consideration, which would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the normal direction of flow.
Backsiphonage means a form of backflow due to a reduction in system pressure, which causes subatmospheric pressure to exist at a site in the water system.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the water, which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease by sewage, industrial fluids, waste, etc.
Cross connection means any unprotected, actual or potential, connection or structural arrangement between a public or a consumer's potable water system and any other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any part of the potable system any used water, industrial fluid, gas, or substance other than the intended potable water with which the system is supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow can or may cause are considered to be cross connections.
(1)
The term "direct cross connection" means a cross connection which is subject to both backsiphonage and backpressure.
(2)
The term "indirect cross connection" means a cross connection which is subject to backsiphonage only.
Cross connection control means connection between a potable water system and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
Cross connection control by containment means the appropriate type or method of backflow protection at the service connection, commensurate with the degree of hazard of the consumer's potable water system.
Devices owned or leased by the City means pipes, hoses, fire hydrants, water lines, water mains, valves, pressure regulators, and water meters as used in this chapter.
Double check valve backflow prevention assembly means an assembly composed of two independently acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly and fitted with properly located resilient seated test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a non-health hazard (i.e., pollutant).
Hazard, degree of, means either a pollutional (non-health) or contamination (health) hazard and is derived from the evaluation of conditions within a system.
Hazard, health, means an actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical or toxic nature to the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system that would be a danger to health.
Hazard, plumbing, means an internal or plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that may be either a pollutional or a contamination type hazard. This includes, but is not limited to, cross connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays and lawn sprinkling systems. Plumbing type cross connections can be located in many types of structures, including homes, apartment houses, hotels and commercial or industrial establishments. Such a connection, if permitted to exist, must be properly protected by an appropriate type of backflow prevention assembly.
Hazard, pollutional, means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would not constitute a health or system hazard. The maximum degree of intensity of pollution to which the potable water system could be degraded under this definition would cause a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause minor damage to the system or its appurtenances.
Hazard system means an actual or potential threat of severe danger to the physical properties of the public or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
Industrial fluids means any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration which would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This includes, but is not limited to, polluted or contaminated used waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system which may deteriorate in sanitary quality; chemical in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulated cooling water connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling waters that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation to canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids used industrially, for other processes, or for firefighting purposes.

b.
A distribution system shall include the network of pipes and conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the consumer's system.
(2)
The consumer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the water purveyor's distribution system, which are utilized in conveying potable water to points of use.
(Code 2005, § 20A-104)
Sec. 38-108. - Policy.
(a)
In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the Backflow Prevention by Containment Program, a copy of which is available in the office of the City Clerk, is hereby referenced and incorporated herein. The Backflow Prevention by Containment Program contains a more comprehensive statement of the rules and regulations to be followed by the Director of Public Works, employees of the Director, and other individuals and business entities whose activities fall within the scope of this article.
(b)
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division laws and regulations, the State of Georgia Plumbing Code and this article for the control of backflow and cross connections. An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system and is to be located immediately downstream of the water meter or as close as physically feasible to the water meter. The type of device is commensurate to the degree of hazard, which is determined by the Public Works Director or his designee. Any installation other than that specified in this section shall be approved by the Public Works Director or his designee. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly is required by this article and is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
(c)
The consumer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the City of Lawrenceville Water Department to determine whether unprotected cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Public Works Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the conditions in conformance with the State of Georgia statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(d)
An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system immediately downstream of the water meter or as close as physically feasible to the water meter, but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
(1)
In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the Public Works Director, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard.
(2)
In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the water purveyor's system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
(3)
In the case of premises having one of the following:
a.
Internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes;
b.
Intricate plumbing and piping arrangements; where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist; or the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.
(e)
The type of protective assembly required under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
(1)
In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.
(2)
In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly.
(3)
In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.
(4)
In the case of any premises where there are unprotected cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
(5)
In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.
(f)
It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have a field test performed by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation, after any repairs and at least once per year. In those instances where the Public Works Director deems the hazard to be great enough he may require field tests at more frequent intervals. These tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester listed on the City of Lawrenceville Certified Backflow Prevention Testers List. It shall be the duty of the Public Works Director or his designee to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. All repairs, overhauls or replacements shall be performed by a licensed plumber in the State of Georgia. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and a copy shall be sent to the Public Works Director or his designee.
(g)
All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices for the purposes described in this section at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the testing and maintenance requirements under subsection (f) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Public Works Director or his designee is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the water purveyor's system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than the minimum maintenance or when the Public Works Director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

The City of Lawrenceville has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(6), (c) and (d) and O.C.G.A. §§ 36-82-61(4)(C)(ii) and 36-82-62(a)(2).
( Ord. No. 2021-5, § 1, 5-24-2021 )
Sec. 38-181. - Findings.
The City Council of the City of Lawrenceville, Georgia, make the following findings:
(1)
The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff.
(2)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the City in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the City.
(3)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the City in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Provision of stormwater management services, stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of the use thereof renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the City and to all parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the City concurrently and the environment in a variety of ways.
(4)
The City of Lawrenceville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the City, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater management systems and facilities in the City in concert with the management of other public utilities in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital program.
(5)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities are needed throughout the City. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the City is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(6)
The provision of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities in the City promotes an essential regulatory purpose by influencing where stormwater runoff flows and how it is managed, thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
(7)
By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from developed parcels, the stormwater management systems and facilities help prevent damage that would subject a parcel owner to civil liability.
(8)
The City Council is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and the environment, and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the City budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith.
(9)
The City has undertaken a comprehensive review by staff and professional consultants of the need for, management of, and funding for, a stormwater utility. The City staff reports and the professional engineering analysis submitted to the City properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the City.
(10)
As a result, the City Council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and the City Council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the City of Lawrenceville.

The Director may determine inspection schedules necessary to enforce the provisions of this article.
(k)
Any failure to meet the obligations set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or by the City in any court of competent jurisdiction.
