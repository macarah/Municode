Sec. 2.4. - Specific requirements for PM mixed use zoning district.
In addition to applicable regulations in this development code, the following requirements shall apply in the PM zoning district;
(a)
Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a PM district. The factors contained under the intent statement for the PM mixed use district section in chapter 2 of this development code, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the planning advisory board and the mayor and city council when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Fort Oglethorpe.
(b)
Allowed uses. Allowed uses in the PM zoning district shall be as shown in the approved development plan.
(c)
Plan review and approval procedures.
(1)
Pre-application conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a PM zoning district, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the director of building, planning and zoning and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch, if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.
(2)
Submission of application for PM district approval.
a.
The applicant must file a petition with the building, planning and zoning director for approval of the proposed PM zoning district. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application:
1.
A general location map.
2.
Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods.
3.
The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures.

The approximate location of existing and proposed streets.
5.
The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan.
6.
The present zoning pattern in the area.
7.
A legal description of the subject property.
8.
The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use.
9.
Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings.
b.
If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows:
1.
An off-street parking and loading plan.
2.
An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
3.
A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site.
(3)
The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information:
a.
A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development.
b.
An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use.
c.
A general statement of the proposed development schedule.
d.
Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance and protection of the development and any common or open areas.
(d)
Review and approval of PM zoning district application.
(1)
An application for approval of a PM zoning district is treated as an application for rezoning, following the procedures in chapter 8 of this code. This is because PM districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed PM district.
(2)
The power to approve a zoning map amendment creating a PM district rests with city council. City council may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan.
(3)
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official zoning map will be changed to indicate the PM zoning district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the director of building, planning and zoning the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
A properly revised development plan.
(4)
The official zoning map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the department of building, planning and zoning.
(5)
No building permits will be issued until the development plan has been approved by city council.
(e)
Issuance of building permits. The director of building, planning and zoning will issue building permits for building and structure in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations.
(f)
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
(1)
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structure may be allowed after review and approval by the director of building, planning and zoning; such changes must be consistent with the purpose and intent of the development plan. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
(2)
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use patterns, the location or dimensions of streets, or singular substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by city council after receipt of recommendations from the planning advisory board. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
(g)
Approval of PM district revoked if construction not begun. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the PM zoning district. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the city council may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject PM district will be removed from the official zoning map, and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated.
(h)
Development standards for PM districts. In addition to applicable development standards contained in this chapter, the following standards are required within PM districts:
(1)
Development plan. The approved development plan must be carried out.
(2)
Density requirements. Density requirements or dwelling units (du) per acre shall be determined by the planning advisory board and recommended to the city council for approval. The intent of density requirements for mixed use development is to allow higher densities along heavy traffic areas and roadways adjacent to more intense uses such as commercial or industrial development. The lesser density development requirements would be more compatible adjacent to single-family or other residential development. Dwelling units per acre allowed:
a.
Five dwelling units per acre.
b.
Seven and one-half dwelling units per acre.
c.
Ten dwelling units per acre.
d.
Twelve dwelling units per acre.
(3)
Deviation from required densities.
a.
The city council may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density of a particular residential use, as long as the applicant can show that such a higher density will not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood.
b.
The city council will consider a deviation from the specified maximum density only upon a favorable recommendation from the planning advisory board.
(4)
Dimensional and bulk regulations.
a.
The location of all proposed buildings and structures must be shown on the approved development plan; minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverages, and floor areas shown on the development plan must be adhered to.
b.
The proposed location and arrangement of structures must not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of a neighborhood.
(5)
Perimeter requirements. City council, upon recommendation of the planning advisory board, may impose the following requirements to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses:
a.
Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the PM district must be set back a distance of 30 to 50 feet from the boundary of the PM district.
b.
Mixed-use development shall have a minimum 30 percent of gross acreage set aside as open space and shall provide recreational areas within said open space.
(6)
Control of area after completion. After completion of a planned development, the use of land and the construction, modification, or alteration of any buildings or structures within the PM district must conform to the approved development plan. If community needs are found to be changing in the future and a revision of the approved development plan is thought to be needed, procedures outlined in the revision of the development plan after approval of plan must be followed.
(7)
Sight distance. In order to ensure maintenance of adequate sight distances at intersections, no fence, wall, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above the ground is permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way of streets or of streets and railroads.
(8)
Open space not to be encroached upon. No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in this development code. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers are not considered to be encroachments of yards. Required open space areas must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this code.
(9)
Landlocked lots. Landlocked lots are not eligible for placement within a PM zoning district.
(10)
Signs. See chapter 5 of this development code.
(11)
Exterior cladding and other requirements for multifamily (apartments and townhomes) and two-family dwellings. See chapter 3 of this development code, section 1.17, Multifamily dwellings and two-family dwellings.
(12)
Development standards shown in approved development plan. Other development standards shown in an approved development plan apply only to the development shown on the specific development plan. Such development standards must be maintained.
(13)
Design standards for all PM zoning district developments.
a.
General. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property, or to the health or safety of residents. The site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions; and no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that would expose people or property to danger.
b.
Soil and ground cover. Exposed ground surfaces throughout the development must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles, and dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone or may be paved.
c.
Site drainage. The ground surfaces throughout the development must be equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains.
d.
Required buffer. A buffer is required along all lot lines of the development. This is in addition to common open space.
(Ord. No. 2021-10, § 1, 6-28-2021)
ARTICLE 3. - BUFFERS AND SCREENING

Sec. 3.1. - Buffer requirements.
(a)
Intent.
(1)
To provide transition between incompatible land uses and to protect the integrity of less intensive uses from more intensive uses, buffering and screening will be required.
(2)
The buffer provides transition between the incompatible uses by requiring a landscape yard of a minimum specified depth along the shared property line.
(3)
The purpose of screening is to provide a year-round visual obstruction.
(b)
Procedure. Refer to Table 4-B below to determine any screening requirements for the proposed development.
(1)
First, identify the type of zoning for the proposed development (in the left-hand column of the table) and each adjoining property (along the top of the table).
(2)
Find where the zoning of the proposed development and each adjoining property intersect on the table. If a buffer is required, a capital letter will indicate the type of buffer to be applied. A description of each buffer type is provided in Table 4-B below.
(3)
When classifying a zoning district for, it the proposed use within a zoning district is also listed as an allowed use within a less-intensive zoning district, the corresponding class for the less-intensive zoning district may be applied. For example, a proposed commercial use within an industrial zoning district may be classified as a commercial zoning district for the purpose of using the table.
(4)
City council may increase the minimum buffer width requirements given in this article as a condition of rezoning, as a condition of a special exception approval, or as a condition to granting a variance.
(c)
Required buffers table.
